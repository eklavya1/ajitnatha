	- the petitioner contended that CAA adding laws to schedule 9 should be open to judicial review on the grounds that it violates the basic structure after the judgment in [[kesavananda bharati case]].
	- the court held that no constitutional amendment act after 24th April 1973 can violate the basic structure of the constitution. therefore any constitutional amendment act that adds any law to the schedule 9 can be challenged for violating the basic structure after 24th April 1973. however the court was ambiguous with respect to whether an act or a regulation that has been found violative of [[a14 eq 前 法]] & [[protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech etc]] can be included in 9th schedule or whether only constitutional amendment act amending the 9th schedule that alters the basic structure can be struck down by the court
