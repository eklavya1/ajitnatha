[[chittagong port]] Armoury Raid (April [[1930]])
Surya Sen decided to organise an armed rebellion along with his associates—Anant Singh, Ganesh Ghosh and Lokenath Baul—to show that it was possible to challenge the armed might of the mighty [[British Empire]].
They had planned to occupy two main armouries in Chittagong to seize and [[supply]] arms to the revolutionaries to destroy telephone and telegraph lines and to dislocate the railway link of Chittagong with the rest of Bengal.
The raid was conducted in April 1930 and involved 65 activists under the banner of the Indian Republican Army—Chittagong Branch.
