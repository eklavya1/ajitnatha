# rise 的 extremists
- *curzon 9905 (1899-1905)*
- 他 brought calcutta municipal corporation 行为 的 [[1899]]
- ↓د no 的 elected members
- ripon brought ULB (urban local bodies) / municipalities _ non-official (electd)
- [[印度 universities 行为 1904]] - brought univs _ control, univs were considered as factories 的 sedition 因为 的 middle class youth (proof 的 西 教学 aiding 印度 natl 动)
- [[印度 official secret amendment 行为 1904]] = to curtail 自由 的 press, essentially a tool to punish press critical 的 政府 的 policies 和 actions (off secrets)
- partition 的 [[bengal]] announced (oct [[1905]])
# extremist 政 
## goals 和 methods
- *swaraj*
-  它 meant diff 事 为 diff 人/leaders
-  为 [[bal gangadhar tilak]] 和 最多 其他 extremist leaders, 它 didn't mean 全 [[independence]] (独立) 但 self-政府 的 admin to 印度 人
-  为 [[bcp bipin chandra pal]] 和 [[aurobindo ghosh]] [[swaraj]] 意思 是 全 独立
-  method- passive resistance
		-  civil disobedience (公民抗命) Gōngmín kàngmìng
		-   它 意思 是 violation 的 unjust 法
		-   boycott 的 brit goods [[E=E]], to hurt brits 经济ly , same happened 里 [[united states of america]] colonies
		-   swadeshi- ie constructive swadeshi, 很 similar to constructive work 的 [[gandhi]]
		-   [[mains]] _Q- gandhian struggles had 它s roots 里 extremists 政 ?_ [[george friedman#^5642c6]]
			- ie dvlp 的 indigenous alternatives 里 industry, health, 教学, 叫 natl 教学
			- swadeshi 过 to promote self-rel, 给en د name- atma-shakti 被 [[rabindranath tagore]]
			- 它 也 meant spiritual dvlpt when tagore set-up `shantiniketan` 为 dvlp 的 atma-shakti (goal to ↑ confidence 的 印度 人 spiritually, 教学, self-rel 里 industry)
			- 用 西 教学 to remove archaic thoughts
		-    brits used to 说 那 印度 人 过 ♀ne 和 所以 不 capable 的 self-rule, ∴ extremists glorified heroes من د past, 比如 - [[Siraj-ud-Daulah]] 5657, 1756-57 , [[maharaja ranjit singh]] 0138 - 1801-39, [[shivaji]] 0144- 1801-44
		-    claimed 那 د 印度 制度 的 [[panchayat]] 是 更 民主 than 西 民主, ∴ moderates 是 wrong 里 说 那 brit rule 会 prep 印度 人 为 self-rule 和 这 不 是 ready 现在
# partition 的 [[bengal]] (oct 1905)
## brit reasons
- 行政 convenience 🏪, governing bengal 过 变得 difficult, 它 过 高est 人口 中 都 provinces as 它 过 [[bengal]], [[odisha]], [[bihar]], [[assam]] (some 分)
- [[balance of power]]
- 他们 要↑د size 的 assam / 过 a *chief commissioner province* to make 它 a LG province ruled 被 LG (lieutenant governor), so assam 有 它s own civil services cadre
- assam-bengal railways 会 come _ single 行政
- partition 的 bengal 被 creating 东 bengal 和 assam would led to cheaper export من assam 茶 garden as [[Chittagong বাংলাদেশ]] port 会 be 里 د 新 province
- curzon 的 minute on territorial redistribution 过 published as risley papers 被 home secretary risley 里 [[1903]]
- 所以 partition 过 proposed 二 年 before (1903), 和 implemented 里 1905
## evaluation
- admin inconvenience 过 merits however best decision 为 这 would 有 been to partition bengal on linguistic lines ie, 1 province 为 bengali speakers 和 so on
- 但 curzon was 反 linguistic 统一 as 它 would 有↑政 clout 的 bengalis
- risley 说 - "bengal united 是 力, bengal divided 会 pull 里 diff ways" 和 这 是 one 的 د merits 的 这 scheme
- real purpose [[balance of power]] was to weaken [[Indian National movement]] 里 bengal
-  د partition 会 mean
		-  bengali 人 would be 少数民族  里 [[bengal]]
		-  muslims 会 be 里 多数  里 东 bengal 和 [[assam]]
-  ∴ curzon was trying to divide bengalis on religious lines + was appeasing د muslims
-  muslims 不 反 partition 的 bengal + 不 ovewhelming participation 里 [[Swadeshi programme]] 动
# swadeshi 动
## background
-  它 变得 a 动 跟 mass agitation, 因为 的 rising inflation , famines (1890),
-  也 emotional issue 因为 的 linguistic nationalism 的 bengalis
-  四 methods/phases 过 there 里 د swad mov
1. *moderate 政* was (1903-05)= inv 用 的 press 被 moderate leaders
- 報紙
-  比如 - bengalee- 被 [[surendranath bannerjea tk]] #pre 
sanjivani hitawadi #pre 

- 这 过 done to oppose partition, 但 这 过 a failure, ∴ partition led to move towards extremists 政
- oct [[1905]], partition decision 被 brits
- formal 开 的 swadeshi 动 when [[surendranath bannerjea]] (a moderate) 给 a call 为 boycott 的 brit goods 里 a meeting 里 calcutta [[kolkata]], 所以 这  移动 过 开 被 moderated 但 dominated 被 revolutionary leaders later

2. *constructive swadeshi*
- lead role played 被 [[rabindranath tagore]] ---> estd `shantiniketan` #pre 
- skill dvlp + spiritual dvlp
- swadesh bandhab samiti
- worked @ village 村庄 level- focus 过 on own 法院s, own 教学 , own skill dvlp
- 过 happening simultaneously
- 比如 - [[bengal]] national college,factories 的 chemical, soap, etc

3. *extremist 政*
- 说 - 只 boycott 的 br goods 和 constructive swadeshi wont make brits bend
- 所以 - 他们 initiated following  activities-
		- continue constructive swadeshi
		- continue boycott 的 goods 和 院
- civil disob- ie 他们 给 call to 人 to violate unjust 法
- extremist 政 = [[gandhi]] - non-violence
- labor strikes 里 外 owned industries 和 plantations
- 为 mass mobilisation- extremist leaders 用 religion to↑د emotions 的 masses
- 他们 用 samitis [[老师 ojha 历史 课 tk#^c93949]] (grassroot org 哪 came up during swadeshi 动)
- 比如 - swadesh bandhab samiti 的 [[a.k. dutt]] -
		-  organized lantern lectures
		-  songs 和 poetry
		-  engaging 里 phy 和 moral training
		-  own 法院 和 appealed 为 boycott 的 bri 法院是
		-  skilling 里 handicrafts
		
-  barisal samiti
		-  也 worked 中 د muslims
		-  barisal conference
				-  [[aurobindo ghosh]] 和 [[surendranath bannerjea tk]] distributed badges 的 bande matram, was  led to police suppression
-  动 failed due to brahmin dominance (bhadralok- gentlefolk)
-  however extremist failed to make 它 a proper mass 动
-  reasons 为 failure -
		-  led 被 elite brahmins [[aristocrats]], 这↓participation من د muslims 和 lower castes
		-  swadeshi goods were expensive 所以  boycott 的 goods had↓participation من د poor sections, 最多 的 د muslims were poor peasants, 所以 brit exp to [[india]] were 不 impacted much 
		-  用 的 coercive methods to make lower castes 和 muslims join د 移动
		-  labor strikes organized 被 workers 为 د 第一 时, however they were limited to 外 商业 , 所以 这 prevented 全 participation 的 working class
		-  用 的 religious symbols- goddess kali, tilaks, pledges etc,↓participation 的 muslims
		-  methods 的 participation
					-  prabhat fairies
					-  jatras - theatrical plays (like arya stark in game 的 thrones) , in it muslims were depicted negatively, 这 led to communal violence, leaders claimed 那 brit 是 being towards muslims, 都 这 led to branding 的 muslims a 其他 的 人
*note- following topic 是  د 第四 point 的 د above trend*
# rise 的 revolutionary terrorism (rt)
- 1908+
-what ? --> individual heroic action to inspire د masses, ie execution 的 unpopular brit officials
- causing defection 里 印度 军 , 但 这 过 tough, 所以 abandoned
- why rose ? --> *failure 的 extremist leaders* 和 *failure 的 [[indian national congress]]*, ie 这 failed to build a proper mass 移动 和 所以 failed to extract a 积极 outcome من brits
- failure 的 [[indian national congress]]
		- [[surat split]] [[1907]], which made [[indian national congress]] defunct 和 allowed د brits to crack↓upon extremist leaders 和 所以 这 made د swadeshi 移动 leaderless, 所以 د nationalistic youth had 不 option 但 rt
# surat split 1907
- [[surat split]] 1907
- [[bombay]] moderates (ferozshah, pm mehta, [[gopal krishna gokhale]]) 反 extremists methods 的 swadeshi 移动, 这 created rift 里 [[indian national congress]]
- pm mehta 要 to end د rise 的 extremists 里 inc
- attitude 的 [[bal gangadhar tilak]] 和 [[lala lajpat rai]] 要 reconciliation 中 moderates 和 extremists, 因为 他们 知 那 split 的 inc 会 make 它 easier 为 brits to suppress extremist leaders {united we stand, divided we fall} [[civil war#^6a9c9d]]
# events
### calcutta session 1906
- extremists were successful 里 getting passed 四 resolutions 里 favor 的
		- B- *boycott*
		- A- *annullment* 的 partition 
		- S- *swadeshi*
		- S- goal 的 *swaraj*
	- 这 过 不 like 被 د moderates
### surat session 1907
- session 过 to be held 里 poona, 但 poona 过 د stronghold 的 [[bal gangadhar tilak]], 所以 د moderates changed د location to surat
- 里 calcutta [[kolkata]] session [[1906]] there 过 生 的 د extremist party within د congress [[congress session]] #pre
- fight 余 presidency 的 surat session [[1907]]
		- من [[moderates]] --> rash behari ghosh [[note]]
- fight 中 [[lala lajpat rai]] who withdrew 因为 不 要 split [[patterns of history#^685973]]
- till 1920, [[indian national congress]] 是 divided
- debates 余 retention/reiteration 的 四 calcutta [[kolkata]] resolutions 的 1906
- extremists 说 那 wont support election 的 RB ghosh as president if 四 resolutions 不 adopted
- 这 led to rowdy scenes 的 chairs 和 shoes 是 hurled at each other #humor, led to surat split, ie, extremists removed من [[indian national congress]] led to  Allahabad session
- [[british]] 也 玩ed divide 和 rule, 他们 开 talking about council reforms, 所以 moderates had developed anxiety 这 extremists' actions 会 hurt their goal 的 入 د council, 所以  他们 要 separate themselves من extremists
- 所以 rise 的 rt 里 [[bengal]] 因为 的 
		- extremists failed to organise proper mass 移动
		-  extremists focused 更 to capturing د congress (ie party 政)
		-  [[indian national congress]] 不 有 只 solid organizational structure , 哪 could 有 channelized د energy 中 د 人
		- ∴大  跟 [[surat split]] 的 1907, SWADESHI 移动 变得 leaderless as soon د [[british]] put many extremist leaders 里 jail 和 there 过 brutal suppressionz
### Allahabad session ( 也 叫 mehta congress)
- declared 这 我们 是 loyal to brits [[british]]

- goals
		- to strike terror 中 د [[british]]
		- removal 的 fear 里 د 心 的 印度 人
		- if 他们 get arrested, then 会 do propaganda 里 法院s, ie 会 raise nationalistic demands during their defense arguments
- repression 的 british 
- [[bal gangadhar tilak]]  sent to jail 里 [[1908]]
- [[aurobindo ghosh]] arrested 和 以后 他 quit 政 和 变得 spiritual [[spirituality]]
- [[bcp bipin chandra pal]] 也 arrested
- [[lala lajpat rai]] went to london 里 1908
