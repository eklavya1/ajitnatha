This is in line with the PCA framework for banks, whose aim was to help improve their financial condition and governance issues.
The framework will apply to all deposit-taking NBFCs, all non-deposit taking NBFCs in the middle, upper and top layers, including investment and credit firms, core investment firms, infrastructure debt funds, infrastructure finance firms and microfinance institutions.
It has excluded NBFCs not accepting or not intending to accept public funds, primary dealers and housing finance firms, along with government-owned ones.
The objective of the framework is to enable supervisory intervention at the appropriate time and require the supervised entity to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner, so as to restore its financial health.
Among large NBFCs (assets exceeding {25,000 crore), rating agency ICRA noted that three entities were in breach of the net NPA criterion as of September. However, all the entities have established parentage.

The RBI introduced the PCA framework in 2002 as a structured early-intervention mechanism for banks that become undercapitalised due to poor [[asset]] quality, or vulnerable due to loss of [[profit]]ability.
It aims to check the problem of [[Non Performing Asset]]s (NPAs) in the Indian [[banking]] sector.
The framework was reviewed in [[2017]] based on the recommendations of the working group of the *Financial Stability and Development Council on Resolution Regimes for Financial institutions* in [[india]] and the *financial sector legislative reforms commission*

Prompt Corrective Action Framework refers to the central bank's watchlist of weak banks.
The regulator imposes restrictions like curbs on lending on such banks.
**The PCA Framework applies to commercial banks and it does not cover cooperative banks.**
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).
	The PCA framework for NBFCs will come into effect on October 1, [[2022]], on the basis of their financial position on or after March 31.

The [[RBI]] has specified certain regulatory trigger points with respect to three parameters for the initiation of the process -
1. Capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR): It is a measure of a bank's capital to ensure that it can absorb a reasonable amount of loss and complies with statutory Capital requirements.
2. Net Non-Performing Assets (NPA)
3. Return on assets (ROA): It is an indicator of how well a company utilizes its assets in terms of profitability.
