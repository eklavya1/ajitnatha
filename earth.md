- the earth was initially a barren, rocky, and hot object with a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. the earth evolved as a layered structure due to density differentiation, that is, heavier materials sank towards the centre and lighter ones moved towards surface, forming layers like crust, mantle, outer core and inner core. the atmosphere also evolved from a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium to the present form with abundance of nitrogen and oxygen. it occurred in three phases(in sequence): 
- loss of primordial atmosphere: the early atmosphere, with hydrogen and helium, is supposed to have been stripped of as a result of solar winds. 
- degassing: during the cooling of the earth, the gases were outpoured from the interior of the earth such as carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia etc. 
- modification by photosynthesis which added oxygen to the atmosphere

- the brief period between sunrise and full daylight is called dawn and that between sunset and complete darkness is called twilight
- it takes place when the earth receives diffused or refracted light from the sun whilst it is still below the horizon
- the time duration is directly related to the obliquity of the sun's rays. like, at poles where the sun's rays have a highly oblique path, the time duration of dawn and twilight is largest. while at the equator, where the sun's rays are almost vertical, the time duration is small. this is due to the fact that with increase in obliquity, the period of refracted light increases.

- the various sources of information about the earth's interior can be classified into direct and indirect sources.
	- direct sources include: 
		-  study of surface rock or the rocks - from mining areas 
		-  deep ocean drilling projects 
		-  volcanic eruption 
	- indirect sources include: 
		-  analysis of properties of matter indirectly provides information about the interior.
		-  meteors 
		-  gravitation 
		-  magnetic field, and 
		-  seismic activity

- rotational speed of earth depends on radius. earth's rotational speed increases as we move towards equator as earth has maximum radius at equator.
- earth's rotation a centrifugal force is created that has led to creation of bulge at the middle of earth and flattened the poles at top.

the major elements of the earth's crust-

- earth is by far the densest planet, in the solar system
- kessler's scenario:the kessler syndrome (also called the kessler effect, collisional cascading, or ablation cascade), proposed by nasa scientist donald j. kessler in [[1978]], is a theoretical scenario in which the density of objects in low earth orbit (leo) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.

# magnetic field
- earth's magnetic field has flipped its polarity many times over د millennia. magnetic reversals are د rule, 不 د exception. earth has settled in د last 20 million years into a pattern of a magnetic pole reversal 关于 every 200,000 to 300,000 years
