geographical area where a particular group of crops (either domesticated or wild) first originated on earth.
many people believed that centres of origin are also centres of diversity. but, the centres of diversity may not represent centres of origin of crop plants. 
centres of origin were 1st identified in [[1924]] by nikolai vavilov.
he considered that great centres of origin were always located in lower mountains and hills of tropical, sub-tropical regions.
he also recognizes some secondary centres of origin where 2 or more species crossed together.
secondary centres of origin are places where natural & artificial selection occurred one after another.
he stated that plants were not domesticated at random but it was a continuous process.
ex of vavilov centres include chinese centres, mediterranean centres etc.
[[india]] is a vavilov centre of high crop genetic diversity.
vavilov "classified the world's crop-producing regions into eight centres of plant origin.
of these areas of crop genetic diversity, india was central to what he called the 'hindustan center of origin'.
