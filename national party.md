A party has to satisfy any one of a number of these conditions.
	A 6% vote share in the last Assembly polls in each of any four states, as well as four seats in the last Lok Sabha polls; or
	2% of all [[Lok Sabha]] seats in the last such [[election]], with MPs elected from at least three states; or
