- sandalwood is a class of woods from trees in the genus santalum. the woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and, unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods for use. sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world. both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for centuries. consequently, some species of these slow-growing trees have suffered over-harvesting in the past.
