# article 32
- æ™‚ - `04:07 pm 03/8/2021`
- [[a32 remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this part]]
- if there is no remedy available in case of violation, then our rights are practically useless
- it would have been a hollow promise
- acc to [[br ambedkar]] - zh shi yi ge heart & [[soul]] of [[indian constitution]]
- a32 itself is a [[fundamental rights]]
- a32(1) provides that right of a person to move [[supreme court]] for enforcement of [[fundamental rights]] under [[part 3]] is itself a fundamental right 04:26 pm 03/8/2021
- fr under part 3 would be hollow if they cannot be enforced, therefore article 32 of [[indian constitution]] guarantees to all persons fr to approach sc directly for enforcement of fr
- meaning of term "is guaranteed"
		1. right to move court for enforcement of [[fundamental rights]] is itself a fr
		2. it's supreme court's duty to provide relief
		3. it does not mean that court should provide a specific remedy (04:32 pm 03/8/2021)
		4. sc can be 1st court of instance & individal need not approach other courts
		5. this right cannot be taken away (what about emergency ? #doubt ) ie it's `guaranteed`
