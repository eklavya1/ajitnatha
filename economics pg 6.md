## Fertiliser subsidy(1:05:00PM)

The major burden on the government is fertiliser subsidy and food subsidy.
The major nutrients required by the soil are N, P, K(Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium).
Nitrogen-based fertiliser is Urea, for Phosphorus, we have Di-Ammonium phosphate(DAP) and for Potassium, we have Muriate of Potash.
Urea subsidy
The subsidy mechanism followed here is known as the Cost-plus approach.
The selling price of urea is fixed by the government of India and the difference between the delivered cost of fertiliser and the selling price payable by the farmer is given as a subsidy to the manufacturer.
The subsidy amount varies between manufacturers depending upon their cost of production (energy norms applicable to them, urea produced using natural gas is cheaper than the one produced by Naphtha). 
Imports are canalised and only three agencies are authorised to import urea. The subsidy on the imports varies with the consignment.
Subsidy on other fertilisers
The subsidy mechanism followed here is known as Nutrient Based Subsidy.
Each kg of potash and phosphorus fertiliser receives a fixed rupee amount as a subsidy that is directly paid to the manufacturer.
The final price is unregulated and determined in the market, although it is expected that it will be reasonable as it will adjust the subsidy amount given by the government.
Issues with the subsidy regime:
The subsidy on urea has resulted in lowering the relative price of urea with respect to other fertilisers. As a result, the application of fertilisers is heavily skewed towards urea, disturbing the nutrient balance in soils.
The low rate of subsidised urea has encouraged smuggling to the adjoining areas in Nepal and Bangladesh.
As a result of low prices and illegal diversions, farmers are not always able to buy all the Urea they want. The excess demand has resulted in black markets where the prices on average are 60% higher than the MRP.
As per a study in 2013, 51% of the farmers ended up paying prices higher than the fixed MRP of the government. The implication of this is that the subsidy that the farmers receive is smaller than the fertiliser subsidy expenditure of the government. 
The subsidy amount differs between the firms and neutralises the advantage of efficient firms. Apart from keeping the inefficient firms in production, the policy discourages capacity addition by the efficient firm.
Explained with diagram.
Reforms attempted by the government:
The key reform attempted here is Direct Benefit Transfer to the farmer via Aadhaar authentication which will be linked to the land records to keep out fraudulent transactions and prevent smuggling across borders. Further, there are recommendations for shifting urea to the nutrient-based subsidy regime.
Neem coated urea- this will stop industry diversion and also has better efficiency as a fertiliser.

## Pricing policy contd(1:53:00PM)

Central issue price: The price at which the FCI sells to the States is known as central issue price.
Issue price- The price at which the State government sells to the final consumer through PDS is known as issue price. The issue price can be further lower than the central issue price as the States themselves can provide some subsidy.
All the three prices- Central issue price, issue price and MSP are recommended by the CACP.
Minimum Support Price(MSP)
MSP is given on 22 mandated crops (14 Kharif, 6 Rabi and 2 commercial crops).
Note that MSP has no legal backing.
Foodgrains include- Wheat, Rice and coarse grains.
How is MSP decided
Explained with the help of PPTs.
There are multiple mechanisms to calculate the input cost(production cost incurred by the farmer). Input cost can be decided by two formulas:
1. A2+ FL
2. C2
A1 cost includes the cost of agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilisers, hired labour, hired machinery, etc.
A2 cost is equal to A1 + Rent paid for leased land
FL is the value of family labour 
C2 includes A2 + FL + interest on the value of owned capital assets(excluding land) + rental value of owned land. This is the most comprehensive value.
MS Swaminathan headed National Commission on Farmers had recommended MSPs to be 50% higher than C2.
In 2018-19, the government agreed that it will be paying at least 50% over the A2+FL method of determining the cost of production.
Mostly rice and wheat are procured under MSP:
1. Because they are stapled crops.
2. The government does not have the resources to procure pulses, etc.
3. Consumption of coarse grains is less as it has an attached status quotient that it is the food of the poor.
Mechanism for sugarcane
There is a provision of Fair and Remunerative Price(FRP) which is again decided by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs(CCEA) on the recommendation of CACP.
There is no subsidy component here but a type of regulation where the government decides the sugarcane price(FRP) at which the sugarcane mills have to buy from the farmers.
Sometimes state governments declare prices over and above FRP known as SAP(State Advisory Prices).
Also, there is a provision of Cane reservation area where the government has specified a cane reservation area under which farmers have to sell their produce to a particular sugar mill and mill owner has to buy sugarcane from these farmers only. This is done as sugarcane is a weigh losing material. this also ensures that mill owners have a regular supply in high quantities.
Provision to help the mill owners clear their dues:
Mill owners can use some of their sugarcane for ethanol production. Ethanol blending will be done with petrol. The price at which the oil marketing companies will buy ethanol from the sugarcane mills is decided by the government. 
Also, the government decided to give export subsidies to mills for the export of sugarcane, however, under WTO export subsidies are not allowed for agricultural produce. 
The government is giving soft loans to mill owners to clear their dues.
The government sets the minimum selling price of sugar in the market to help the mill owners.
The buffer stock of sugar is maintained by the mill owners themselves. The government pays the buffer subsidy to the mill owners for maintaining this storage of sugar. Sometimes this buffer subsidy is directly given to the farmers when a mill has to pay dues of that farmer.
Various procurement schemes of the government
Explained with PPTs.
1. Centralised procurement system
FCI directly undertakes the procurement of foodgrains or State government agencies procure the foodgrains and handover the stocks to FCI. The cost borne by the State government is reimbursed by the FCI.
2. Decentralised Procurement System
It was launched in 1997-98.
State Government itself undertakes direct purchases of paddy/rice and wheat and also stores and distributes these foodgrains under NFSA and other welfare schemes.
The Central Government bears the complete expense incurred by the State governments.
3. Price Support Scheme:
Applicable in case of MSP notified crops.
Intervention by DAC&FW(The Department of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers' Welfare ), Government of India whenever market prices fall below MSP.
4. Market intervention Scheme:
It is for those crops for which MSP is not notified mainly horticulture products.
Market intervention made if prevailing market prices less than 10% or production more than 10% compared to the corresponding figures in the previous year.
5. Price stabilisation fund:
In 2014-15, the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) was established under the Department of Consumer Affairs to regulate the cost volatility of essential agricultural commodities, such as onion, potatoes and pulses and protect the consumers.
Problems with MSP:
Increasing burden on the government as the MSP system was started as a support mechanism for emergency situations. But now it has become a regular feature and with rising MSP and procurement incidentals the burden on the government is increasing.
Higher MSP can lead to a rise in the general price level of food commodities.
Distortion of cropping pattern as farmers tend to produce crops with higher MSP ignoring the geographical suitability and other commercial factors.
Open procurement of rice and wheat leads to huge wastage of grains.
Most of the benefits of the system are taken up by rich and influential farmers. The procurement system is not uniform across the States, some of the states corner most of the benefits.
Announcing MSP has become the primary tool of intervention in agriculture while other critical issues such as capital investment, developing irrigation facilities and the need for changing landholding patterns have been ignored. An overemphasis on price policy has distracted the attention from the important task which could have enabled the technological breakthrough in the Indian agricultural system.
## Possible Solutions:
### Price Deficiency payment system
The farmers are compensated for the difference between the government announced MSP and the actual market prices the farmers received on selling. The government is not involved in procurement or storage.
Private procurement and stockist scheme
Under this, the MSP linked procurement system is open to the private sector where empanelled enterprises chosen through a transparent mechanism are allowed to enter the market for purchase at MSP.
PM- AASHA scheme is an example.
