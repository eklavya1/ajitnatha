polity class 35

an overview of previous class was given (1.14 pm)

## appointment of judges to higher judiciary (1.16 pm)

article 124- judges are to be appointed by president by warrant under his hand & seal until he attains age of 65 years.
cji- would be senior-most judges as convention.
in 1st judgesâ€™ case, sp gupta vs uoi, court held that consultation under article 124 does not mean concurrence & it only implies exchange of views thereby meaning that executive has primacy in appointment process.
in 2nd judgesâ€™ case, court reversed its earlier ruling & held that word consultation implies concurrence. it meant that view of cji would have primacy in appointment of supreme court where cji would also consult 2 senior-most judges of supreme court.
court also held that senior-most judge of sc should be appointed as cji.
in 3rd judge's case, court further clarified upon its judgment in 2nd judge's case where it opined that consultation process to be adopted by cji requires consultation of plurality of judges & sole opinion of cji does not constitute consultation process.

## collegium system (1:43 pm)

it was provided for by supreme court in 3rd judgesâ€™ case.
supreme courtâ€™s judgment in 3rd judgesâ€™ case also led to formation of collegium system where collegium would consist of cji & 4 other judges of supreme court.
court held that a consensus-based approach has to be adopted for appointment b/w collegium & if 2 or more judges disagree on a particular name (for appointment) then cji should drop recommendation of judge for appointment to supreme court.
further, court held that in case of a judge of a high court is promoted to be judge of supreme court; cji should also consult a judge of supreme court belonging to that high court along with these 4 senior-most judges of supreme court.
views of judges should be expressed in writing & not orally.
court also held that recommendation made by cji without complying with norms & requirements of consultation process is not binding on govt.

### issues with collegium system (1:56)

lack of transparency- there is no transparency with working of collegium system in india.
there has been a concern over quality of judges appointed by collegium system.
significantly reduced role of executive in appointments. original balance in consultation has been disturbed. this has created a tussle b/w executive & judiciary.
it has led to a lack of accountability on part of judiciary.
it has disturbed concept of checks & balances.
uncle judges syndrome- as per 230th report of law commission said that nepotism is prevalent in collegium system.
parliament introduced njac, 99th constitutional amendment act.
it was struck down by sc of india.
it was giving primacy to executive. thereby compromising on independence of judiciary which is part of basic structure.
this system is violative of principle of separation of power.
so, a memorandum of procedure (mop) was proposed.
kindly refer to handout.
sc collegium decided that it would upload its decisions on appointment & transfer of judges of higher judiciary.
way forward:
there should be judicial primacy but not judicial exclusivity.
