1. POLITY AND GOVERNANCE
1.1. BALANCE OF RIGHTS AND DUTY
Why in News?
Recently, the Union Law Minister advocated the need to find a
balance between the fundamental rights and duties for the
country’s progress during Constitution Day Celebration.
About Rights and Duties
• Fundamental to any civilization, rights represent the claims
of an individual which are essential to his or her existence
and development.
○ This includes the economic, social and cultural rights
(ESC rights) recognized by society or State through
legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or
entitlement.
• Similarly, each person carries certain duties towards other
individuals, society, nation, or humanity as part of society
and its norms.
○ E.g., based on Rita (natural order or truth), Vedas gave
the principles of Dharma (duty) and Karma (action).
Rights and Duties in Present India
• The Constitution of India is the main document, defining
rights and duties of people. E.g., Part III of the Indian
constitution covers Fundamental Rights and Part IVA
covers the Fundamental Duties, i.e., the core duties that
every citizen is expected to perform.
○ Some rights are outside Part III as well. E.g., Right to
Property (Article 300A) which is a constitutional right
and not fundamental.
• Though both are indispensable, duties have taken
backstage in present India in comparison to rights.
○ E.g., whether it is ‘Right to Life’ or ‘Freedom of Speech
and Expression’, both remain in focus quite
frequently. But in terms of duties, except few like
“corporate social responsibility”, others are talked
about little.
Benefits of Perceiving Rights and Duties Together
• Complementing Nature: Each right comes with a
corresponding obligation to respect and protect the rights
of others.
o E.g., if the Media has the right to freedom of speech,
it becomes their duty to respect others’ privacy as
well.
• Immunize Individual Liberties: Though Rule of Law is state
responsibility, duties ensure that at least the majority of
the population is inclined to uphold law without external
enforcement.
5 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Ensure Peace and Harmony: Duties taken together with rights help administration in constructive engagement with
people. It helps in building mechanisms to promote a culture of peace and harmony while discouraging acts of
violence and all forms of discrimination.
o E.g. If one abides by the Constitution and respects its institutions earnestly (first fundamental duty), peace and
harmony increases. Similarly, conscious decision to abjure violence helps in preserving the vibrancy and
pluralistic nature of society.
• Help State in Performing its Duty: Without people’s support State can’t ensure all rights.
o E.g., To meet the educational and nutritional needs of everyone, State needs the support of parents or individuals
who work on field or help in resource availability by paying taxes.
• Avoid Narrow Egoism: Common humanity and genuine respect for others’ right require people to overcome
selfishness and to avoid human rights violations. As Giuseppe Mazzini in “The principle of Duty” said:
“With the theory of happiness as the primary aim of existence, we shall only produce egoistic men. We have therefore
to find a principle … which shall guide men toward their own improvement, teach them constancy and self-sacrifice,
and unite them with their fellow men … And this principle is Duty.”
Issues in Perceiving Rights and Duties Together
• Difference of Nature: Certain rights are acquired by every human being from the moment of birth, but duties need
capable individuals to perform.
• Rights are precursors to Duties: Without basic dignity and fulfillment of rights, individuals can’t perform their duties.
○ E.g. Without fulfillment of the Right to education, duties of respecting others rights, social justice, gender equality
etc. are difficult to expect.
• Different legal status: Justiciability is a key feature of rights. Rights can be enforced through writ of the court or
remedy can be sought. But duties are non-enforceable. They only guide or aid to interpret constitutional and legal
issues (AIIMS Students Union v. AIIMS, 1983).
• Provide a potential leeway to State from its responsibilities: Protection of Rule of law and human rights is a state
responsibility for which it enjoys special powers under laws. E.g., non-fulfillment of duties cannot be given as a reason
for non-enforcement of rights.
• Risks of subordination: In a democracy, the fundamental unit of the constitution is an individual. Equal focus on duties
carries risk of individual subordination to collective will.
• Vague and Subjective Nature: Another issue is the vague nature of duties and its clash with certain religious
principles. E.g., the noble ideals of our freedom struggle cover a wide diversity and at times conflicting interpretations
with other principles.
Way Forward
To preserve human rights and dignity, a minimum balance alongside independent application should be maintained by-
• State accepting its primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights irrespective of fulfillment
of duties by citizens.
• Meeting the minimum core rights of each citizen such as the ESC right of individual to ensure an adequate standard
of living before any duties.
o Independent Human Rights Institutions for monitoring State institutions (police, judiciary or civil administration)
on fulfillment of their obligations to protect human rights and prevent violations.
• Deepening the roots of democracy to address the fundamental issues of inequality, intolerance etc. based on caste,
creed, religion, region etc. minimizing risks of subordination of rights and maximizing the possibility of fulfillment
of duties.
• Creating a basic charter for people to cultivate constitutional morality and create responsible citizens. As Article 29
(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says, “Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the
free and full development of his personality is possible”.

1.2. DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE
Why in News?
Speaking at the first Summit for Democracy, the Prime
Minister (PM) of India advocated for democratic
principles to guide global governance.
More about Summit for Democracy
• It is a two-stage flagship presidential initiative
from the USA to put democracy and human rights
at the heart of U.S. foreign policy.
• It brought together leaders from democratic
governments, civil society, and private sector.
• It aims to bolster democracy from local to global
levels through its three Pillars of focus (as given in
image).
• At the summit, the USA launched
its Presidential Initiative for
Democracy Renewal with $424.4
million to bolster democracy from
local to global levels.
Global Governance and Global Risks
Global Governance is a means to
manage issues that cut across national
borders to create a fairer and just
world.
• It involves a complex of
institutions, policies, norms,
procedures, and initiatives to
coordinate collective action
globally and address transnational
challenges.
• These interventions include
providing public goods,
developing unified standards, and
ensuring equality and justice
among States and their citizens to
bring more predictability,
stability, and order.
• Amid increasing global risks post
COVID-19 with worsening
economic and ecological crises, mounting geopolitical and social tensions etc., global risk-management has become
the most crucial common good to protect the idea of a fair world.
• Democratic principles can help in this idea by creating a far less conflicted world and build prosperous societies while
protecting fundamental freedoms of all without distinction.
Principles of Democracy and its Benefits in Global Governance
• The Global State of Democracy Report, 2021 identified five core principles or attributes of democracy with different
distinguishing features of democracy from other forms of governance as given in the infographic.
7 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Some of the major benefits of these democratic principles in global governance are:
o Help in networking people, corporations, state and international institutions together to build partnerships for
common good.
○ Achieve global development goals
through universally accessible and
citizen-centric public services.
o Protecting fundamental freedom
globally by strengthening UN and
other global governance systems
through rules-based regimes.
o Promoting contemporary human
interaction by including new age
actors in governance and allowing
increased segmentation and
fragmentation of the overall
governance system across different
levels and functional spheres.
o Promote Common but differentiated
responsibilities and respective
capacities in addressing global issues
through its values of justice.
o Establishing an inclusive, accountable and responsible sovereign across nations through control over abuse of
power.
o Giving Legitimacy to the government and its decisions. This is visible in little or no rule countries which seek
legitimacy by calling themselves a democracy.
Challenges faced by Democracies
• Rising Authoritarianism: As per Global State of Democracy Report (2021), countries moving in an authoritarian
direction in 2020 outnumbered those going in a democratic direction. Similarly, the Freedom House report marked
2020 as the 15th
consecutive year of global freedom in retreat.
• Questions on Electoral integrity: Whether it was USA or other democracies, the electoral integrity is increasingly
being questioned. Due to pandemic risks, allowing citizens to continue exercising their democratic rights has become
challenging.
• Corruption: Corruption in public life has remained a major challenge across nations, compromising the health,
education and overall welfare of people.
• Disinformation: In the last few years, disinformation has become a major tool for subversion of democracies through
propaganda, misuse of technology etc. at local and global level.
Way Forward
With intergovernmental cooperation at the heart of global governance, democratic principles are vital to address
fragmented and complex global governance.
It can help in bringing international leaders together if we overcome the challenges to democratic principles through
reforms like:
• Strengthening democratic values and institutions with enhanced ties between people, and new transnational actors
from the private sector and civil society.
• Ensure free and fair elections through cooperation among democracies to ensure competitive elections in which
opposition stands a realistic chance of accessing power.
• Supporting free and independent media to ensure freedom of press, fighting disinformation and prevent government
institutions from using authoritarian means.
8 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Fighting corruption through novel approaches to harness big data, artificial intelligence, and digital technologies to
detect and prevent fraud and corruption in governance.
• Advancing technology for Democracy through use of technology companies to preserve open and democratic
societies, and shape global norms on emerging technologies like social media and crypto-currencies.
• Addressing Democracy Deficits by bolstering democratic reformers and addressing issues of weak institutions or poor
governance.
• Support transitional democracies and guide regional efforts through partnerships with regional groupings acting as
intermediary bodies. E.g. ASEAN, EU etc.
• Bring reforms to global institutions such as the UN Security Council and others to increase the voice of democracies
and build partnerships to address global risks.
## 1.3. PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE
Why in News?
Centennial celebrations of
Public Accounts Committee
(PAC) were held recently.
About Public Accounts
Committee (PAC)
• It is the oldest
Parliamentary
Committee and was first
constituted in 1921
under the provisions of
the Government of India
Act of 1919 (in the wake
of the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms).
• Committee consists of 22 Members; 15 Members are elected from Lok Sabha and 7 Members from the Rajya
Sabha are associated with it.
• The Speaker is empowered to appoint the Chairman of the Committee from amongst its members.
o W M Hailey was its first president, and Bhupendra Nath Mitra its first Indian president. The last president
before Independence was Liaquat Ali Khan.
o Until 1966 – 67, the chairman of the committee
belonged to the ruling party. However, since 1967 a
convention has developed whereby the chairman of
the committee is selected invariably from the
Opposition.
• It is constituted by Parliament each year for
examination of accounts showing the appropriation of
sums granted by Parliament for expenditure of
Government of India, the annual Finance Accounts of
Government of India, and such other accounts laid
before Parliament as the Committee may deem fit such
as accounts of autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies.
o Accounts of those of Public Undertakings and Government Companies which come under the purview of the
Committee on Public Undertakings are exempted.
Major Functions of PAC
• Scrutiny and Examinations of Accounts: It scrutinizes the Appropriation Accounts of the Government of India and
the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.
CAG and PAC
• Article 148 provides for an independent office of CAG.
He is the head of the Indian Audit and Accounts
Department.
• CAG submits three audit reports to the President:
o Audit report on appropriation accounts,
o Audit report on finance accounts, and
o Audit report on public undertakings.
• The President lays these reports before both the
Houses of Parliament.
• After this, the Public Accounts Committee examines
them and reports its findings to the Parliament.
9 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o It examines the statement of accounts showing the income and expenditure of State Corporations, trading and
manufacturing schemes, projects and autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies.
• Regularisation of Expenditure by satisfying itself that
o The amount shown in the accounts as having been disbursed was legally available for, and applicable to, the
service or purpose to which have been applied or charged.
o Expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it.
o Every re-appropriation has been made in accordance with the provisions made in this behalf under rules framed
by competent authority.
• Others
o Consider the report of the C&AG in cases
where the President may have required him to
conduct an audit of any receipts.
o Discuss points of financial discipline and
principle, without getting concerned with
questions of policy in the broad sense.
Importance of PAC
• Maintain high standards of public morality in
financial matters by keeping a check on indiscretion
in the implementation of policies and programmes
approved by Parliament and also make
recommendations to streamline the administration
for efficient, speedy and economical
implementation of policy.
• Ensure expenditure is incurred in a prudent
manner by holding Executive accountable for its use
of public money and also keeps a vigil on the
spending and performance of the government, to
bring to light inefficiencies, wasteful expenditure.
• PAC reports provide valuable information and
feedback to the various stakeholders including the
policy makers. Citizens can use this report to
question their representatives and hold the public servants to account.
Way forward for strengthening the functioning of PAC
Following recommendations were made at the All India Conference of the Chairpersons of the PAC of Parliament and
State/ UTs Legislatures:
• Better relationship w.r.t CAG: PAC should be consulted before the appointment of CAG and CAG should be made
accountable to the legislature.
o CAG reports should be more current, and their examination should also be quicker so that the issues are dealt
quickly.
• Wider ambit: PACs should take up suo-motu cognisance of public issues and government’s flagship programmes and
examine financial wrong-doings.
• Discussion in Parliament: In each Session, at least two-and-a-half hours, should be allocated for discussion and debate
on PAC recommendations vis-à-vis action taken by the Ministries.
• Public opinion: PAC, before finalizing their reports, should provide an opportunity to the members of public to give
their reactions on the recommendations. Also, PAC proceedings should be open to the press except in sensitive
matters.
• Binding recommendations: PAC recommendations should be made binding on the government.
• Help from external experts: Services of experts should be availed by PAC on technical matters. Also, PAC should get
the powers to examine the retired officials also.

1.4. ELECTION LAWS (AMENDMENT) BILL
Why in news?
The Election Laws
(Amendment) Bill, 2021
was passed by the
Parliament.
About the bill
• The Bill amends
the Representation
of the People Act,
1950 (the RP Act,
1950) and
the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (the RP Act, 1951) to implement certain electoral reforms.
• Changes introduced are given in below table:
Area Existing provisions Changes brought
Linking electoral
roll data with
Aadhaar (by
amendment of
section 23 of the RP
Act, 1950)
• The 1950 Act provides that a person may apply to
the electoral registration officer for inclusion of
their name in the electoral roll of a constituency.
• After verification, if the officer is satisfied that the
applicant is entitled to registration, he will direct the
applicant’s name to be included in the electoral roll.
• The electoral registration officer may
require a person to furnish their Aadhaar
number for establishing their identity.
• If their name is already in the electoral roll,
then the Aadhaar number may be required
for authentication of entries in the roll.
• Persons will not be denied inclusion in the
electoral roll or have their names deleted
from the roll, if they are unable to furnish
Aadhaar number due to sufficient cause as
prescribed.
o Such persons may be permitted to furnish
alternate documents prescribed by the
central government.
Qualifying date for
enrolment in
electoral roll (by
amendment of
clause (b) of section
14 of the RP Act,
1950)
• Under the 1950 Act, the qualifying date for
enrolment in the electoral roll is January 1 of the
year in which such roll is being prepared or revised.
• This implies a person who turns 18 (i.e., eligible to
vote) after January 1 can enrol in the electoral roll
only when the roll is prepared/ revised the next
year.
• The Bill amends this to provide four
qualifying dates in a calendar year, which
will be January 1, April 1, July 1, and
October 1.
Gender-neutral
provisions (by
amendment of
section 20 of the RP
Act, 1950 and
section 60 of the RP
Act, 1951)
• The 1950 Act permits certain persons who are
ordinarily resident in a constituency to register in
electoral rolls. Such persons include those holding a
service qualification, such as members of the armed
forces or central government employees posted
outside India.
• The wives of such persons are also deemed to be
ordinarily residing in the same constituency if they
reside with them.
• The 1951 Act enables the wife of a person holding a
service qualification to vote either in person or by
postal ballot.
• The Bill replaces the term ‘wife’ with
‘spouse’ in both the Acts.
Requisitioning of
premises for
election purposes
• The 1951 Act permits the state government to
requisition premises needed or likely to be needed
• The Bill expands the purposes for which
such premises can be requisitioned.
11 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
(amendment of
section 160 of the
RP Act, 1951)
for being used as polling stations, or for storing
ballot boxes after a poll has been conducted.
• These include using the premises for
counting, storage of voting machines and
poll-related material, and accommodation
of security forces and polling personnel.
Significance of the Bill
• To stop bogus voting: Linking of electoral roll data with the Aadhaar ecosystem will help in curbing the menace of
multiple enrolments of the same person in different places. The bill allows the electoral registration officers to
authenticate the persons already included in the electoral roll to identify registration of same person in more
than one constituency or more than once in the same constituency.
o Thus, it will help in cleaning the electoral roll to a great extent and facilitate elector registration in the location
at which they are ‘ordinarily resident’.
o A Parliamentary Standing Committee report had advocated linkage of unique Aadhaar ID Card number with
voter I-card which would streamline alterations in Electoral photo ID card (EPIC) during change of ordinary
residence by the electors.
• Improving the accessibility to voting: Linking the two databases will allow the ECI to track migrant workers and
improve their election participation.
• Multiple cut-off dates: The January 1 cut-off date deprived several youth from participating in the electoral exercise
held in a particular year. Multiple cut-off dates will allow more eligible people to be registered as voters.
• Gender neutral: Under existing provisions, an Army man’s wife is entitled to be enrolled as a service voter, but a
woman Army officer’s husband is not. The bill seeks to redress discrimination against male spouses of female
armed services employees.
Concerns associated with the Bill
• Discretion with electoral officer: Electoral officer has uncanalised discretion since the law does not prescribe any
guiding principles to decide when an Aadhaar number may be “required”.
o Moreover, the Central government has the final say in prescribing “sufficient cause” under which an individual
will be permitted to enter or remain on the electoral rolls, in case of inability to furnish Aadhaar.
• Burden of proof shifts: Instead of the Government proactively ensuring registration on the electoral rolls (such as
through house-to-house verification) to achieve universal adult franchise, the burden now shifts to individuals who
may be unable/unwilling to link their Aadhaar to justify their retention on the rolls.
• Risk of disenfranchisement: Using Aadhaar to clean the electoral rolls is fraught with the risk of disenfranchisement,
especially of the marginalised communities. The inclusion and exclusion errors of Aadhaar database would cascade
to the electoral database.
o A study in Latin America revealed that countries with a single form of ID were likely to have fewer citizens
participating in the electoral process since they were unable to prove their identity.
o In 2015, media reports highlighted that lakhs of voters in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were reportedly
excluded from the electoral process due to the practice of linking Aadhaar numbers with electoral ID.
• Political profiling: By linking electoral IDs with Aadhaar numbers, it is easier to track which voter has accessed welfare
subsidies and benefits using their Aadhaar. This can be used by political parties to selectively target their messages
to specific voters.
• Passed in haste: The bill has been passed without putting up the legislative text for public consultations beforehand,
and without any discussion. This undermines the fundamental premise of a parliamentary democracy i.e. to allow
elected representatives the opportunity to voice the concerns of their constituents over laws that affect them.
• Other issues with usage of Aadhaar: Aadhaar project is being used for purposes far beyond the stated “welfare”
purpose that was upheld by the Supreme Court of India in the Aadhaar judgment as the basis for the introduction
of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill in Parliament.
o Further, Aadhaar was only meant to be an identity proof, not an address proof. In contrast, the Registration of
Electors Rules, 1960 (formulated under RPA 1950) clearly stipulates address to be a key index for electoral rolls.
✓ Also, Aadhaar is not meant to be a citizenship proof. Residence of 182 days can make even a non-citizen
eligible for an Aadhaar ID and thus voting.
12 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o The enrolment processes for voters’ lists and Aadhaar are completely different. Whereas Aadhaar enrolment is
based on production of existing documents, voter enrolments involve physical verification and “house visits”
by a registration officer or representative.
o Maintenance of the voters’ lists is a primary responsibility of the ECI, an independent constitutional body, whereas
UIDAI is under government control. Since the ECI has no control on either enrolment or deduplication in Aadhaar,
it appears a potential conflict of interest to use Aadhaar for electoral rolls.
o There are no publicly available audit reports either on the efficacy of Aadhaar deduplication or on the
authenticity of the Aadhaar database.
Conclusion
Keeping in mind the above-mentioned concerns, suitable institutional and technological mechanisms need to be
developed before the move is implemented such as steadfast implementation of Personal Data Protection Law. Further,
given the tricky and contentious nature of issues, need for adequate debate and discussions cannot be over-emphasised.
## 1.5. ANTI-CONVERSION LAWS
Why in news?
The Karnataka legislative Assembly passed The Karnataka Right to Freedom of
Religion Bill, 2021, commonly referred to as the anti-conversion Bill. The Bill will
now go to the Karnataka Legislative Council.
Key features of the bill
• Prohibition: It prohibits conversion from one religion to another by
misrepresentation, force, fraud, allurement, or marriage. However, it
exempts a person who “reconverts to his immediate previous religion” as
the same shall not be deemed to be a conversion under this Act.
• Nature of offence: The offence of conversion has been deemed to be a
cognizable and non-bailable.
• Penalties: Jail terms and fines have been proposed.
States that have anti-conversion laws
Currently, there are at least nine states
in the country where legislations on
unlawful conversions are in force:
• Odisha,
• Madhya Pradesh,
• Arunachal Pradesh,
• Gujarat,
• Himachal Pradesh,
• Chhattisgarh,
• Jharkhand,
• Uttarakhand and
• Uttar Pradesh
13 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
Rationale behind anti-conversion laws:
• Fear of change in demography: Anti-conversion laws are considered a remedial measure to the problem of
conversion which is considered as a way to bring demographic change.
• Not blanket ban on prohibition: The laws are not brought to stop the conversion but are intended to prohibit
conversions that are effectuated by force, inducement, or fraud. Supporter of these laws argue that since present
instances of such conversions are high, these laws are designed to criminalise such activities.
• Strengthens religious freedom: Since they provide stringent provisions for forced or induced conversion, they are
considered as necessary safeguards for the protection of religious freedom, a right guaranteed both constitutionally
and in international human rights instruments.
o The freedom given in the Article 25 of Indian Constitution is not absolute but subject to the restrictions as public
order, health, morality, and other fundamental rights.
o India’s legal dispensation only recognizes the conversion which is not done with inducement or threat.
• Constituent assembly debates: During CA debates, Sardar Patel had expressed concern about forceful conversion
which later became as the moral base of anti-conversion laws in India. Another member Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
had proposed that conversion should be banned and conversion only on oath before a judge should be permitted.
Issues with the anti-conversion laws
• Burden of proof: The burden of proof
that the conversion was ‘lawful’ lies on
the person who has ‘caused’ the
conversion and where such conversion
has been facilitated by any person, on
such other person.
o Thus, laws reportedly focus
more on prosecuting the
‘convertor’ and opinion of the
person who has converted is
considered less.
• Lack of equitable treatment: It is argued
that the anti-conversion laws both by
their design and implementation
infringe, upon the individual’s right to
convert and may favour one religion
over other.
• Creates an atmosphere of fear: Reports
suggest that though there are very rare
instances of prosecution or arrest under
anti-conversion laws, but they create the
atmosphere of fear amongst the couples
willing to do inter-faith marriages.
o There have been reports regarding
incidents of arrest of some minority
leaders under these anti-conversion
laws.
• Vague nature and wide scope: The
terms used in such laws like force, fraud,
allurement etc. are loosely defined,
leaving wide scope for misuse. The misreading of laws could result in instances of physical attacks following
accusations of wrongful conversions. They are also believed to deepen communal fault lines.
• Against freedom of religion: Religion or spirituality is the most integral part of human nature and thus any undue
ban on it can be a gross violation of human rights.
Legal challenges to anti-conversion laws and pertinent verdicts on the
subject
• Rev. Stainislaus vs State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors (1977): It examined
the earliest anti-conversion statutes in Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.
Court upheld the constitutionality of both the Acts on the ground that
these efforts to restrain the conversion are for securing freedom of
conscience and public order.
o Freedom to propagate one’s religion, as stipulated under Article 25
(1), did not grant a fundamental right to convert another person.
The bench ruled that a purposive conversion would impinge on the
“freedom of conscience” guaranteed to all citizens.
o It also held that the Anti- Conversion Acts fall within the purview of
Entry I of List II of the Seventh Schedule as they are meant to avoid
disturbances to the public order by prohibiting conversion from one
religion to another in a manner reprehensible to the conscience of
the community.
• Sarla Mudgal case (1995): Supreme Court held that conversion to Islam
was not valid if done only in order to be able to practise polygamy.
o This position was reaffirmed by the apex court’s judgment in the Lilly
Thomas case in 2000, which clarified that prosecution for bigamy
was not a violation of the freedom of religion under Article 25.
• Lata Singh Vs State of UP: The apex court highlighted the need for
stringent punishment over acts of violence or threats in cases of inter-
caste and inter-faith marriages.
• M Chandra Vs M Thangamuthu & Another, 2010, the Supreme Court laid
down the test to prove conversion: First, there has to be a conversion
and second, acceptance into the community to which the person
converted. It also stated that the need of a conversion cannot be
altogether done away with.
• Ga Arife alias Arti Sharma Vs Gopal Dutt Sharma, 2010, and in Faheem
Ahmed Vs Maviya, 2011: The Delhi high court lamented that religious
conversions are increasingly used for anything but the primary reason
for conversion i.e., spiritual advancement.
14 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o Several important international documents recognize the concept of freedom of religion like Article 18 of the
Universal declaration of human rights and Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR).
o They are also antithetical to the freedoms granted by provisions in the Special Marriage Act under which persons
belonging to two different religions get married.
o They also raise concerns about the privacy of individuals who wish to adopt other religions and the liberty of an
individual to choose a partner from another religion.
Conclusion
The constitutional validity of the anti-conversion laws in at least four states – Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh is pending before the Supreme Court. Court has agreed to test the validity of these laws
but has refused to put a stay on them. Any challenge to these laws would require the Supreme Court to relook at its
Stainislaus judgment while also taking the right to privacy judgment into account.
## 1.5.1. SACRILEGE
Why in news?
Punjab government has written to centre for assent to state’s bill that proposes life imprisonment for desecration of
religious scriptures of four religions.
More about news
• Request has been made in the backdrop of a sacrilege incident at the Holy Sikh temple in Amritsar.
• The Punjab Vidhan Sabha in 2018 had passed ‘The Indian Penal Code (Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2018 and The Code
of Criminal Procedure (Punjab Amendment) Bill 2018’ as states can amend parts of IPC and CrPC to suit local
practices and circumstances.
o Bills provide for punishment up to life imprisonment for whoever causes injury, damage or sacrilege to Shri
Guru Granth Sahib, Srimad Bhagwat Gita, Holy Quran and Holy Bible with the intention to hurt the religious
feelings of the people.
About Sacrilege
• Also termed as Blasphemy, it means treating a religious
object or place without the respect that it deserves.
• Unlike other countries like Pakistan, India being a secular
state protects all the religions by blasphemy laws.
• Sections 295 and 295A, 296, 297, 298 of the Indian Penal
Code (IPC) presently deals with blasphemy incidents.
o Section 295 deals with punishment if any
person intentionally damages, destroys or defiles
any religious object deemed to be sacred by
followers of any religion in India, including objects other than idols and books.
o Section 295A deals with punishment if a person maliciously by words spoken or written or signs or by visible
representation insults or attempts to insult religious sentiments.
• However, concerns have also been raised as blasphemy laws may be used to hound individuals from religious
minorities and even fellow religious mates for sectarian and personal motives.
Way Forward
• Though blasphemy laws limit an individual’s right to the freedom of expression and speech, but if its objective is
reasonable then such laws may be drafted with suitable safeguards.
• Also, the solution is as social as political and the key lies in making people educated, sensitizing them around the
true happenings and sowing seeds of tolerance and respect for all religions in the society.
Need of Blasphemy laws in India
• To protect religious sentiments as guaranteed by the
Indian constitution as India is a secular country. Also, the
Fundamental rights assure religious freedom to all.
• To maintain communal harmony as incidents such as
these sow seeds of distrust and an environment of
stress in the community.
• To prevent mobocracy as most sacrilege incidents have
resulted in mob lynching which is a grave danger to
principles of democracy that are fundamental to the
country.
• To maintain law and order in the state.

1.6. JUDICIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN INDIA
Why in news?
Chief Justice of India has proposed creation of a National Judicial Infrastructure Authority of India (NJIAI).
About NJIAI
• The NJIAI’s objective will be to take control of the budgeting and infrastructure development of subordinate courts
in the country.
• Key features of the proposed body
o It will be established on the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) model, where by it would work as a
central agency with each State having its own State Judicial Infrastructure Authority.
✓ NALSA provides free Legal Services to the weaker sections of the society having overall national body along
with similar entities at state and district levels.
o The Chief Justice of India would be the patron-in-chief of the NJIAI and it would be placed under Supreme Court
of India, unlike NALSA which is under Ministry of Law and Justice.
o In the NJIAI there would be a few High Court judges as members, and some Central Government officials.
Judicial Infrastructure in India
• Judicial infrastructure includes the physical premises of
courts, tribunals, lawyers’ chambers etc.
o It also involves the digital and human resources
infrastructure, including the availability of all the
resources that are essential to ensure timely
dispensation of justice.
• Efficient “judicial infrastructure” means providing
equal and free access to justice which can be realised
through a “barrier free and citizen friendly
environment”.
• At present, primary responsibility of development of
infrastructure facilities for judiciary rests with state
governments.
• Central Government augments the resources of the
State Governments by releasing financial assistance
under a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for the
Development of Judicial Infrastructure.
Need for such reforms in Judicial infrastructure
• Poor state of judicial infrastructure in the country: The
total sanctioned strength of judicial officers in the
country is 24,280, but the number of court halls
available is just 20,143, including 620 rented halls.
o 26% of court complexes do not have separate ladies’ toilets.
o Only 32% of the courtrooms have separate record rooms and only 51% of court complexes have a library.
• Positive correlation between adequate judicial infrastructure and productivity in justice delivery: Adequate and
quality judicial infrastructure are the basic pre-requisite for judges, lawyers, and judicial officers to efficiently perform
their responsibilities while dispensing justice
o According to NMJDR, adequacy of judicial infrastructure is a pre-condition for reducing delay and backlogs in
cases. (Present backlog: 3.3 crore cases)
• Improve digitisation program of government: In the backdrop of COVID 19 pandemic and the shift towards digital
mode, it is all the more important to ensure modernization of judicial infrastructure in the country.
o At present, 73% of court rooms have no video-conferencing facility.
CSS for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary
• Its objective is to assist the state government in
construction of court buildings and residential quarters
for Judicial Officers (JO) in all the States / UTs.
• Union government has recently extended the scheme for
the period from 2021 to 2026.
• Assistance granted under the scheme also includes funds
for implementation of the Gram Nyayalayas Scheme as a
part of the National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal
Reforms (NMJDLR).
o Gram Nyayalayas or village courts are established
under Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 for speedy and
easy access to the justice system in the rural areas of
India.
o NMJDLR was setup in 2011 to increase access to
justice by reducing delays and arrears in the system.
16 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Lack of accountability: In the absence of a dedicated special purpose vehicle or body for the purpose of enhancing
judicial infrastructure, nobody is willing to take responsibility to execute infrastructure projects.
o Most district judges, who head trial courts, also do not vigorously pursue development projects due to short-
term appointments and transferable jobs among others.
• Underutilisation of funds: Some states transfer part of the funds for non-judicial purposes.
o Of a total of ₹981.98 crore sanctioned in 2019-20 under CSS, only ₹84.9 crore was utilised by a combined five
States, rendering the remaining 91.36% funds unused.
• Implementation issue: Improvement and maintenance of judicial infrastructure is still being carried out in an ad-hoc
and unplanned manner owing to lack of a single dedicated agency for the purpose.
Other Reforms need to improve Judicial Infrastructure
• Increasing budgetary allocation to judicial branch: According to the recently released India Justice Report, between
2011-12 and 2015-2016, India’s annual average spending on the judiciary was just 0.08% of the GDP.
• Delegating Administrative Functions: Presently, the respective registries of the courts are mostly tasked with carrying
out the judiciary’s administrative functions.
o In countries like UK, US and Canada, the administrative functions of courts and tribunals including infrastructure
and financial resources are supported by a separate professional agency.
• Ensuring Barrier-Free Access: Adequate provisioning of availability of ramps, tactile pavements and braille notices for
those with visual impairment, and separate washrooms designated for persons with disabilities.
• Improve shortage of staff in Judiciary: By improving upon collegium system for higher judiciary and removing delay
in recruitment made by state commission/high courts for lower judiciary.
• Using Technology: IT can be leveraged for video conferencing, streamlining procedures and for case management
systems like e-library of cases. Also, artificial intelligence may be used for assisting judges and lawyers.
• Decentralising high courts and establishment of more benches.
Conclusion
Institutionalising the mechanism for augmenting and creating state-of-the-art judicial infrastructure will help in delivering
quantitative and qualitative justice and ensure the bell of justice rings at the door of those deprived and underprivileged.

2. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
2.1. UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF 1971 INDO-PAK WAR
Why in News?
Commemorating 50 years of India’s victory in 1971
war, the nation paid tribute to the brave Indian
soldiers for their sacrifice which ensured victory in
the war.
What was the context behind the war?
• The Indian subcontinent represents a
geographically unique region with long shared
ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and historical ties,
especially with immediate neighbors.
○ E.g. Nepal with UP-Bihar, Bangladesh with
West Bengal-Assam, present day Pakistan
with bordering Indian states etc.
• Under the ‘Partition of India’, the territory of
Pakistan was divided into two distinct
geographies, i.e. West Pakistan (now Pakistan)
and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).
• With West Pakistan’s dominance over
institutions such as Parliament, Judiciary etc., the
people of East Pakistan soon started to face injustice and suppression on various fronts such as-
○ At Social Level: The Bengali ethnic identity and language didn’t get due recognition. E.g. Urdu was declared as the
national language despite Bengali or Bangla speaking majority (58% population- 1951 census) and people
movement for it (recognized only as State Language later).
○ At Economic Level: Low representation of East Pakistan people in jobs, including Army and Civil Administration,
with almost 400% gap in per capita income of two regions.
○ At Political Level: The nation was largely controlled by military leaders (Ayub Khan from 1958-69 and Yahya Khan
from 1969-71). The West Pakistan further failed in-
✓ Meeting greater autonomy demands of East Pakistan in 1966, and
✓ Democratic transfer of power to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after his party (Awami League) landslide victory in
the 1970 election.
• Soon, it turned into forceful suppression of East Pakistan, i.e. killing of unarmed civilians, mass exodus and rape
under Operation Searchlight and in turn Bangladesh Liberation War.
Why did India enter into the war?
• Threat to Humanity: The atrocities on the people of then East Pakistan involved blatant misconduct and the injustice
was a threat to others, as Martin Luther King Jr. said, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere'.
• Mass Exodus of People: By November 1971 nearly 10 million refugees entered into India because of atrocities,
creating a huge socio-economic challenge for Border States.
• Silence of the Western nations over atrocities: Despite repeated Indian requests, UN and other nations like US failed
to move towards a peaceful solution to prevent annihilation of a community.
• Pakistan aggression against India: Finally, the air-strikes on Indian territory from West Pakistan on 03 December
1971, under Operation ‘Chengiz Khan’, dragged India into war in order to uphold peace, justice and humanity.
21 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
What has been the impact of the War?
The 13-day war of 1971 between India-Pakistan is a landmark geopolitical event in the history of the sub-continent.
Besides the liberation of Bangladesh, it changed the history and geography of South Asia with its repercussions felt
beyond the region. The major impact of war includes:
Nation/Institution Major Impact
India Domestically, it gave only a temporary relief from huge influx of refugees with rise of internal movements
(e.g. Assam Movement) but at geopolitical and strategic level it helped India to:
• Protection of vital Sea Lines of Communication in Indian Ocean, especially the narrow passages in Bay
of Bengal like the ten-degree Channel;
• Protect ‘Chicken-Neck’ or ‘Siliguri Corridor’ through a more peaceful neighbor;
• Address the land and maritime border disputes peacefully. E.g. the Land Boundary Agreement in 2015
between India and Bangladesh;
• Curb insurgency in Northeast through cooperation with Bangladesh (often used by insurgents from
Nagaland and Assam); and
• Diplomatic and Tactical gains by India in terms of global relationship (e.g. BIMSTEC with Bangladesh as
member of it) improved armed forces coordination and knowledge on special operations.
Pakistan Military gained more say in the governance of the nation by blaming parliamentary system and government
mismanagement as reasons behind its loss with:
• Start of Nuclear Program in 1972, and
• Adoption of Indirect war strategy against India. E.g. Terrorism.
Bangladesh Helped the people of Bangladesh to protect their identity and draw their own destiny through peaceful co-
existence based on historical relationships. Independence also helped Bangladesh in:
• Emerging as a major garment exporter of the world.
• Build bilateral relationship with India and other nations, and
• Jointly work with like-minded nations for growth and prosperity.
USA Due to US’s role in formation of US-Pakistan-China group and deployment of its 7th
fleet (USS Enterprise) in
Bay of Bengal to deter India and prevent the liberation of Bangladesh, the:
• India-US relationship deteriorated at that point of time and remains as a point of distrust in the
relationship;
• Loss of face by going against protection of human rights and democratic values.
22 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
Soviet Union Recognition as a ‘Stabilizing Factor’ and reduced influence of USA in the South Asian Region. This was due
to events like-
• Signing of ‘Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation’ with India for assured military and diplomatic
support in the event of war,
• Increased acceptance due to its recognition to the policy of non-alignment.
United Nation (UN) The muted UN response and UNSC attempt to have a ceasefire soon after Pakistan attack on India (04
December, Vetoed by Soviet Union) showed:
• The need for reforms in the institution in order to protect democratic values and basic human rights.
• The prevalent dominance of the Western Nations (especially US) in the global institutions.
Conclusion
The 13-day war was not just a blitzkrieg operation to change the political structure of a nation. It was a war to protect
the moral and democratic traditions. Thus, the Swarnim Vijay Parv is a celebration of the political leadership and
professionalism of our armed forces, as well as of the country, considered as the oldest living civilization of the world.
2.2. EMERGING BRI ALTERNATIVES: OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIA?
Why in News?
Recently, the European Commission
launched ‘Global Gateway’, EU strategy
on global infrastructure financing with the
aim to mobilize up to €300 billion in
investments between 2021-2027.
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
• Launched in 2013 as One Belt One
Road, BRI is a Chinese infrastructure
development project to fund the
development of land and sea routes
to link Asia, Africa, and Europe.
• Today, it is the largest and most
ambitious global infrastructure financing and development initiative of the world.
• Estimates suggest that BRI has invested in more than 2,600 projects in over 100 countries with an estimated cost of
$3.7 trillion. This includes ports, railways, energy, digital networks etc.
• Potential benefits of BRI:
o Boost regional connectivity and modernize facilities (port and airports);
o Improve mobility to access new markets;
o Harness new energy resources;
o Improving overall efficiency and competitiveness of economy etc.
What are the concerns associated with BRI?
• Lack of Transparency: BRI lacks transparency on its strategy or purpose which has been highlighted by several African
countries.
• Debt-trap diplomacy: Due to unsustainable debt burden, BRI has emerged as a tool to exert undue pressure and gain
political leverage against a defaulting nation. E.g. China took the Hambantota port of Sri Lanka for 99 years over the
issue of loan default.
• Violation of Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity: Through projects like China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), BRI
violates the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India. Similar approach may guide its future
projects.
• Expand Global Dominance: With apprehensions on dual-use of ports and digital networks, BRI is seen as a state-
backed campaign for Chinese global dominance.
23 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Use of unethical business practices: Almost 89% of all BRI contracts are executed by Chinese construction companies
using Chinese labor. Similarly, issues of corruption, cost inflation, secret deals, ‘unreported and underreported debt’
are also prevalent.
• Environmental and Social Risks: Due to insufficient ecological feasibility studies and other risks, its compliance to the
environmental and labour standards is poor.
Emerging Alternatives to BRI
Developed countries have been funding infrastructure for a long time. E.g., Japan through ADB. But the growing regional
concerns and assertiveness of China has led to launch of big infrastructure projects* for a coherent response from them
like:
Features Build Back Better World (B3W) by G7 Global Gateway by EU
About G7 approach to collectively catalyze funds for
infrastructure development for low- and middle-income
countries.
Europe’s strategy to connect people and countries in a
smart, sustainable, and fair way.
Guiding
Principles
Funding Mobilize bilateral, multilateral as well as private sector
capital in line with Addis Ababa Action Agenda on
Financing for Development.
Funding by EU, its Member States, financial and
development institutions like European Investment
Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and private funds.
Key areas of
Focus
Four areas of focus as- Climate; health and health
security; digital technology; and gender equity and
equality.
Five areas of focus as- Digital sector; climate and
energy; transport; health; education and research
sectors.
*- At COP26, the UK also launched a Clean Green Initiative with over 3 billion pound of climate financing for green growth
in developing countries over the next five years.
Opportunities for India in Global Infrastructure
With an estimated US$ 15 trillion gap between global infrastructure needs and actual investment by 2040 (from Global
Infrastructure Outlook, a G20 initiative), Global Infrastructure always had opportunities from others. E.g., In 2017, India
and Japan initiated Asia-Africa Growth Corridor.
But the growing Chinese attempts to leverage BRI for geo-economic, geo-political and strategic interests have opened
more opportunities for India in Global Infrastructure.
24 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Partnership with EU: Recently, EU signed a
Comprehensive Connectivity Partnership
with India to support ‘resilient and
sustainable connectivity projects’ in Africa,
Central Asia, and Indo-Pacific for digital,
energy, transport and people-to-people
connectivity.
• Partnership with B3W: India is likely to
engage with B3W initiative as well because
of its principles and the space offered to
India.
o Emerging as a counterweight to the
China dominated Asia,
o Affirm the shared values of democracy,
freedom, and respect for human rights,
o Establish a more viable, inclusive,
transparent, and rules-based
connectivity system.
o Help other nations in faster post Covid-
19 recovery and achieve sustainable
development goals through projects of
socio-economic importance.
• Bilateral engagements: The space created
due to distrust over China and the ills of BRI
lends can be filled by India especially in development projects in African and South-east Asian countries (where
traditionally both China and India have been competing).
Way Forward
• Improving Policy Coordination: Plan and support large scale, high impact infrastructural development projects by
streamlining the bureaucratic web and creating single-point processes.
• Enhancing Viability of Projects: Promote economic cooperation by facilitating cross-border investments and deepen
supply chain integration to address the damaging impact of Covid-19 on the global economy on developing
economies.
• Overcoming Capital deficiency: By deepening the bilateral and multilateral financial Integration among like-minded
nations with use of private sector-to-private sector financing model.
• Promoting Democratic Values: Promote people to people cultural exchange with visible performance improvements
through projects to gain people trust and confidence.
Alongside these external initiatives, India should work on building domestic capabilities with a long-term perspective to
offer more services from creating infrastructure to offering mobility and other solutions.
2.3. G20
Why in news?
Recently, India joined the G20 ‘Troika’ and is set to take over its presidency in 2022.
More in News
• Troika refers to the top grouping within the G20 that consists of the current, previous and the incoming presidencies
— Indonesia, Italy, and India.
o India will assume the G20 presidency on 1st December 2022 from Indonesia and will convene the G20 Leaders’
Summit for the first time in India in 2023.
25 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• As a Troika member, India will work
closely with Indonesia and Italy to ensure
consistency and continuity of the G20’s
agenda.
About G20
• It is a strategic multilateral platform
connecting the world’s major developed
and emerging economies.
o The G20 was created in response to
the financial crises that arose in
several emerging economies in the
1990s and to a growing recognition
that some of these countries were not
adequately represented in global
economic discussion and governance.
• It started in 1999 as a meeting for the
finance minister and central bank governors. G20 was raised to the Summit level in 2008 to address the global financial
and economic crisis of 2008.
o It holds a strategic role in securing future global economic growth and prosperity.
• The G20 has no permanent secretariat.
o Agenda and the work coordination is completed by G20 leaders’ personal representatives, known as sherpas
together with finance ministers and central bank governors.
• The objectives of the G20 are:
o Policy coordination between its members to achieve global economic stability, sustainable growth.
o To promote financial regulations that reduce risks and prevent future financial crises; and
o To create a new international financial architecture.
• India has been a founding member of G20 process and has played an active role in proposing new ideas and finding
solutions.
Importance of G20
• Global Economic Growth: Because of its size and
strategic importance, the G20 has a crucial role in
setting the path for the future of global economic
growth.
• To address global crisis: Previous summits have
addressed the 2008 financial crisis, the Iranian
nuclear program, COVID-19 pandemic and climate
change.
o G20 nations committed to pump more than $5
trillion into the global economy and contribute
to the WHO-led COVID-19 solidarity response
fund.
• Tax reforms: International taxation has been a regular feature of G20 deliberation since the summit’s start in 2008.
It can help low income developing countries benefit from the ongoing and wide-ranging tax reforms to bring greater
transparency to the international tax environment, through exchange of information, and address tax avoidance by
large corporations through the OECD and BEPS (Base erosion and profit sharing) project.
o At the Rome summit, G20, 2021, leaders endorsed an agreement among nearly 140 countries to overhaul the
system of international corporate taxation.
o The agreement—the culmination of a years-long process led by the G20 and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD)—includes a 15 percent minimum tax as well as new rules to redistribute
some tax revenue from big multinational companies.
26 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Recast bilateral ties: Many experts stress the substantial effects of personal relationships among leaders on making
foreign policy. By gathering so many leaders together, G20 summits offer rare opportunities to develop such
relationships and recast bilateral ties.
o Bilateral meetings on the summit’s sidelines have occasionally led to major international agreements.
• Human Resource Development and Employment: In 2014, the G20 committed to reduce the gender gap in workforce
participation by 25% by 2025. In support of this initiative the G20 also developed National Employment Plans which
provide opportunities for inclusion.
o In 2015, it also agreed to reduce the share of young people who are most at risk of being left permanently behind
in the labour market by 15% by 2025.
o The target group in this regard has been G20 and Low-Income Developing Countries Framework identified as low
skilled or informally employed young people and the young people who are neither in employment nor in
education or training (NEETs).
Issues with G 20
• Lack of effective power: It has been argued that G20 is not a legally binding institution and needs to be given more
teeth.
• Transparency and Accountability: The absence of a formal charter for the group and the fact that some of the most
important G-20 meetings are held behind closed doors.
• Protectionism: Some of the group's policy prescriptions have also been unpopular, especially with liberal groups.
Protests at the group's summits have accused the G-20 of encouraging trade agreements that strengthen large
corporations.
• Ineffective measures: It is criticized for being delinquent in combating climate change, and in failing to address social
inequality and global threats to democracy.
• Under-representation: Critics argue that the group is overly restrictive, and its practice of adding guests, such as
those from African countries, is little more than a token effort to make the G-20 reflective of the world's economic
diversity.
Conclusion
The world is so interconnected and integrated now that countries have to work together to resolve all global issues. G20
must provide the vision to bind all the countries especially the emerging markets like Indonesia, India, Brazil and Mexico
which are new actors in global governance to support coordinated actions on major global issues and promote global
public goods.

price to producers.
o India’s export subsidy for sugarcane producers
includes Production Assistance Scheme, Buffer
Stock Scheme and Marketing and Transportation
Scheme.
• In its response to WTO members, India said the support
given was largely to small and marginal farmers and
was in accordance with its commitments at WTO.
• AoA states that Domestic Support shall not exceed De
minimis level.
o De minimis levels are up to 5% of value of production
for developed countries and 10% for developing
countries like India.

Resolution 2593 (2021), which unequivocally
demands that Afghan territory not be used for
sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist
acts.
o India floated a ‘four C’ approach: Focusing on
commerce, capacity enhancement, connectivity,
and contacts to further expand the cooperation
between the two sides.
o Terrorism: Called for early adoption of the UN
Comprehensive Convention on International
Terrorism.
o Connectivity: Decided on full utilization of
Chabahar port in Iran for regional connectivity.
• These 5 Central Asian countries are also members of
the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and they
skipped the meeting organized by Pakistan on the
situation of Afghanistan to attend the dialogue in Delhi.

Indian fishermen and 10 boats on charges of alleged
poaching and illegal fishing in the island nation’s
waters.
o India has taken up the issue of early release of the
Indian fishermen and boats with the government
of Sri Lanka.
• Reasons behind India- Sri Lanka fisheries dispute:
o Lack of defined maritime boundary: Though India
and Sri Lanka signed four Maritime Boundary
Agreements between 1974-76, there is no well-
defined maritime boundary between the two
countries.
✓ The 1974 agreement between the two nations
ceded the resource-rich Katchchativu islet to
Sri Lanka, which the Tamil fishermen had
traditional fishing rights for centuries.
o Tightened surveillance: Since 2009, the Sri Lankan
navy has tightened surveillance of its northern
maritime boundary to halt a potential return of
Tamil insurgents.
o Depletion of marine resources along the Tamil
Nadu coast (due to incessant bottom-trawling) has
meant that the Indian fishermen are drawn to the
relatively resource-rich Sri Lankan waters.
✓ Sri Lanka has banned bottom-trawling in their
waters in 2017.

3. ECONOMY
3.1. PRIVATISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS
Why in news?
Finance secretary recently said that the government will “eventually” privatise most of the Public Sector Banks (PSBs)
and keep its presence to a bare minimum.
More about news
• Finance Minister in the Union Budget 2021-22 announced that two PSBs would be privatised as part of the
government's disinvestment target.
• The government had listed the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill 2021 to be taken up during the Winter Session of
Parliament.
• The bill intends to amend the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts of 1970 and 1980,
and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 to create enabling legislation for privatisation of public sector banks.
• Centre is yet to shortlist the name of two public sector banks (PSBs) that are likely to be privatised in FY22.
Need for Privatisation of PSBs
• For better human resource management: Privatisation will help in introducing a high degree of professional
management. On account of huge human capital deficit, PSBs are seriously handicapped vis-à-vis their competitors
in the market place. This is due to their employee compensation package, skill sets, skewed age profile, restrictive
deployment and inefficient performance management system.
• Autonomous decision making: Control and interference by the government prevents PSBs from staying competitive
in the current environment. They will, thus, continue to be hobbled by outdated systems and practices. High level of
autonomy will facilitate faster decision making, paving way for innovation and expertise.
• To develop Innovation and Achieve Expertise: Private players will have will and capital to innovate new products
avenues (new schemes, services, etc.) and make the industries to achieve expertise in their respective fields by
offering quality service and guidance. This will help in bringing cost effective services and higher customer
satisfaction.
• For enhanced efficiency in debt coverage: The assets quality and efficiency of debt coverage of private sector banks
are better than that of public sector banks. A comparative study for the period of 2015 to 2019 has found that in
comparison to private sector banks, public sectors banks registered higher NPAs.
o The study had selected top five banks (as per total assets) from private and public sector. It found that while
average Non-performing Asset (NPAs) of all the selected private sectors banks was less than 5%., it was more
than 5% for all the selected Public sectors banks.
• PSBs are losing market share: Private Banks are operating in creamy places, cherry picking customers and PSBs are
left with the difficult markets in poorer districts. Urban and semi-urban consumers have been shifting to private
banks.
Concerns associated with Privatisation of PSBs
• Financial exclusion of the weaker sections: Driven by the profit motive, private sector banks concentrate on the
more affluent sections of the population and the metropolitan/urban areas. Privatisation of PSBs will therefore lead
to the financial exclusion of the weaker sections of the society, particularly in the rural areas.
o State-owned banks focus on public interests and provide many services to the common people at affordable
cost.
o Merger of PSBs has resulted in decline in PSBs branches by 3,321 between 2017 and 2021. PSB privatisation
would accelerate these trends.
• Job loss: PSB mergers have brought down the number of PSBs from 27 to 12, resulting in employee retrenchment
and bank branch closures. Total employee strength of PSBs has fallen from 8.57 lakh in 2017 to around 7.7 lakh in
2021.
30 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o The privatisation will further shrink employment opportunities for the youth. The SC/ST/OBC sections would be
deprived because unlike the public sector, the private sector does not follow reservation policies for the weaker
sections.
• Concerns regarding safety of deposits: A significant number of private banks and financial institutions have failed in
recent times. But there is not even a single instance of bank failure in the case of PSBs. Privatisation of PSBs will
remove the sovereign guarantee behind the PSB deposits and make household savings less secure.
o It is to be noted that PSBs account for 65% of all commercial bank deposits and 70% of all individual bank
deposits in India. It shows that Indian customers preferred the safety and security of their deposits offered by
the PSBs.
• Macroeconomic effects of bank failures: Any failure of banks will have a tremendous contagion effect and will derail
the economy. From 1935 to 1947, there were 900 bank failures in our country. From 1947 to 1969, 665 banks failed.
This became driving factor for bank nationalisation in 1969.
o The depositors of all these banks lost their deposited money. Even after 1969, 36 banks failed but these were
rescued by merging them with other government banks. Few very recent instances of failure are Lakshmi Vilas
Bank and YES Bank.
• Privatisation is not a panacea to problems faced by PSBs: The major problem faced by banks i.e. NPAs is common
for both the private and public sector banks. The government may have difficulty in providing additional capital to
the government banks on account of fiscal constraint and the banks are in need of additional capital to maintain
Capital Adequacy Ratio for continuing their lending operations.
o Some experts consider that getting rid of PSBs on account of such problems is akin to throwing the baby out with
the bathwater. Opponents of privatisation say that stringent regulation and freedom from political and
bureaucratic control and influence are the right set of solutions for strengthening PSBs.
Few recent steps taken to strengthen PSBs
Area Details
Tech-enabled,
smart banking
• Setting up of Loan Management Systems and Centralised Processing Centres, resulting in reduced
retail loan disbursement turnaround time.
• Launch of PSBloansin59minutes.com and adoption of the Trade Receivables Discounting System
(TReDS) for digital lending for MSMEs and retail customers.
• Advanced queue management systems in transaction-intensive branches, with single-window
operations, to reduce customer waiting and transaction time.
• A few PSBs have introduced centralised processing hubs for faster time-bound processing and app-
based loan application and offers for agricultural loans;
• Larger PSBs are providing customer-need driven credit offers through analytics.
Monitoring of
loans
• Institution of comprehensive, automated Early Warning Systems (EWS) in banks, use of third-party
data and workflow for time-bound remedial actions, to proactively detect stress and reducing slippage
into NPAs;
Risk management • Institution of technology- and data-driven Risk Scoring and Scrutiny systems in banks that
comprehensively factor in third-party data and non-financial risk factors and provide for higher scrutiny
of high-risk cases;
• Improved adherence to risk-based pricing;
• Empowerment of bank Boards to recruit the bank's Chief Risk Officer from the market, on market-
linked compensation.
Resolution and
recovery
• RBI's revised prudential framework on stressed assets.
• Putting into place one-time settlement platforms and portals, eDRT (Debt Recovery Tribunals) for online
recovery case management.
Governance • Introduction of non-executive chairmen;
• Strengthening of the Board committees system;
• Effective use of non-official directors, by giving them mandate to play role akin to independent director
and institution of their peer evaluation and training.
Human resource • Ensuring role-based e-learning for continuous learning for all officers;
• Putting in place objective Performance Management Systems.
Recapitalisation • Infusion of Rs.3.17 lakh crore by the Government;
• Mobilisation of over Rs. 2.49 lakh crore by the banks themselves;
31 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
Marketing strategy
and reach
• Doubling of the dedicated marketing salesforce between March 2018 and March 2020;
• Quadrupling of sourcing of loans through the salesforce and marketing tie-ups between Q4 FY2017-18
and Q4 FY2019-20.
Road Ahead
• Privatisation can be limited to few PSBs: While privatising few PSBs sounds a logical decision in light of immense
benefits, attempting to privatise all banks will undermine the tremendous contribution of these banks to the country
over the years.
• Graded Format towards privatisation: Government may not fully exit from the state-run banks that are to be privatised
and instead retain at least a 26% stake for the first few years. Even Narasimham Committee – I had recommended
dilution of government stake in PSBs to 33 percent. The extent of the stake sale will depend on interest from investors
and market conditions.
• Identification of investors: identifying a fit and proper investor to own the stake in these banks will be important.
One of the options could be, the stakeholders of existing large banks may consider acquiring these PSBs, retain them
as wholly owned subsidiaries with independent identity until they attain better operational efficiency. They can
eventually merge with acquirer bank.
• Achieving the objective of big banks: Privatized PSBs can be merged with existing large private banks, to attain the kind
of scale and size to develop higher risk appetite and lending capacity.
• Developing new asset quality review (AQR): The last asset quality review (AQR) of banks in 2015 failed to detect
lenders evergreening loans outside the formal restructuring process. Evergreening refers to banks extending fresh
loans to delinquent borrowers to help them repay existing loans, hiding the true extent of bad loans.
o RBI audit had found that Private sector lender Yes Bank had under-reported bad loans by ₹3,277 crore in the
FY2019.
3.2. FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT
Why in news?
Reserve Bank released the 24th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR), a bi-annual report that reflects risks to
financial stability and the resilience of financial system.
Highlights of report
• Global Economy: The global economic recovery has been losing momentum in the second half of 2021 in the face of
resurfacing COVID-19 infections, the new variant Omicron, supply disruptions and bottlenecks, shifts in monetary
policy stances across advanced and emerging economies.
• Domestic Economy: On the domestic front, progress in vaccination has enabled the recovery to regain traction after
the debilitating second wave of the pandemic. Notwithstanding signs of slowing pace more recently, the corporate
sector is gaining strength and bank credit growth is improving.
• Risk assessment: All broad categories of risks – global; macroeconomic; financial market; institutional; and general
– were perceived as ‘medium’ in magnitude but risks arising on account of global and financial markets were rated
higher than the rest.
o Commodity prices, domestic inflation, equity price volatility, asset quality deterioration, credit growth and cyber
disruptions were rated as the major risks. (Refer table for key parameters.)
• MSME Sector: Credit to the MSME segment slowed down (y-o-y) by the end of September 2021 vis-a-vis March 2021.
Emerging signs of stress in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) as also in the micro finance segment call
for close monitoring of these portfolios going forward.
Parameters Key findings from report Definition
Gross non-
performing
asset (GNPA)
ratio
• For Scheduled commercial banks (SCBs): GNPA ratio may
increase from 6.9 per cent in 2021 to 8.1 per cent by 2022
under the baseline scenario and to 9.5 per cent under a
severe stress scenario.
• For NBFCs: GNPA ratio which had declined in 2020, rose
to reach 6.5 per cent at the end of 2021.
NPAs indicate how much of a bank’s loans are
in danger of not being repaid. A very high gross
NPA ratio means the bank’s asset quality is in
very poor shape.
32 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
CRAR • Capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of scheduled
commercial banks (SCBs) rose to a new peak of 16.6 per
cent in 2021.
It is the ratio of a bank’s capital in relation to its
risk weighted assets and current liabilities.

• PCR of SCBs stood at 68.1 per cent in September 2021. PCR is ratio of provisioning to gross non-
performing assets and indicates the extent of
funds a bank has kept aside to cover loan losses.
3.3. FINTECH
Why in news?
Prime Minister inaugurated InFinity Forum- a leadership
Forum on Financial Technology (FinTech) through video
conferencing.
More about news
• It was hosted by the International Financial Services
Centres Authority (IFSCA) under the aegis of the
Government of India in collaboration with Gujarat
International Financial Tec-city (GIFT) City and
Bloomberg.
• It brings together the leading minds of the
world in business and technology to come
together to discuss how technology and
innovation can be leveraged by the FinTech
industry for inclusive growth and serving
humanity at large.
About India’s Fintech Industry
• The term “FinTech” is a contraction of the
words “finance” and “technology”. It is an
umbrella term to denote technological
innovation having a bearing on financial
services (Refer infographic).
• Indian FinTech industry valued at $ 50-60 Bn in
FY20. According to a Boston Consulting
Group report, Indian fintech companies will
reach a valuation of US$150-160 billion by 2025.
• India is a frontrunner among emerging
economies in terms of Fintech adoption, with an
adoption rate of 87% in March 2020, compared
to a global average of 64%. India has 3rd largest
FinTech ecosystem globally
Sectoral Potential of Fintech companies in India
• Credit: Fintech solutions have the potential to
transform the lending and investment
landscape. Fintech helps consumers and
businesses with faster and easier access to
capital, providing online services to directly
match lenders with borrowers who may be individuals or businesses. Examples include Crowd Funding and Peer-to-
Peer Lending.
Related concepts
• Neo-banks are online-only financial technology (fintech)
companies that operate solely digitally or via mobile app.
Ex. Razorpay X, EpiFi etc.
o They have disrupted the traditional banking system by
leveraging technology and artificial intelligence (AI).
• As a related concept, Challenger banks also leverage
technology to streamline the banking process. However,
they also maintain a brick and mortar physical presence.
o They are different from traditional banks in the sense
that their presence is much smaller.
33 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Payments: Fintech provide services that enable transfer of funds for various use cases - P2P (Person-to-Person), P2M
(Person-to-Merchant), G2P (Government-to-Person) etc. For instance, introduction of Unified Payment Interface
(UPI) has provided a boost to the payments sector in India.
• Insurance and advisory services: Fintech firms are providing platforms to consumers to save, invest, manage their
wealth and choose from a spectrum of financial products across categories such as personal loans, home loans,
credit cards, saving accounts and mutual fund.
• Pensions: Fintech-enabled technologies such as robo-advise can make financial planning more accessible. Fintech is
increasing the efficiency of the operation of pension schemes through risk management applications, automation of
investment processes and facilitation of regulatory compliance
• Account aggregator services: These services aggregate financial data of a customer from different financial services
providers and leverage this data to build analytics and insights to help consumers manage their financial
commitments and goals. In 2016, RBI released guidelines for NBFCs that intend to function as account aggregators.
• Trade Finance: Invoice trading is another nascent area of fintech application in India. It assists MSMEs that often
struggle with working capital and cash flows due to delayed payments. For example, TReDS is an online mechanism
for facilitating the financing of MSMEs through multiple financiers.
Challenges faced by Fintech sector in India
• Data security and privacy risk: Data leaks, platform downtimes, and information theft has become quite rampant
in the financial services space. Developing a strong mechanism to protect data is of paramount importance, and
players will have to invest deeply in mechanisms to control this risk and comply with regulatory requirements
towards data security.
• Varied adoption: It’s not easy for every type of business to adopt FinTech. It is especially complicated for an economy
like that of India’s which is dominated by MSMEs that largely sit on the fence of digital adoption.
• Rapidly changing regulations: Regulatory compliance comes with a cost, and frequent changes do not help to offer
business confidence. A few regulations, such as regulations for investment exits, cryptocurrency, payment
regulations, data, infrastructure security, and consumer protection, are still evolving.
• Lack of financial literacy and awareness: About 70% population of India lives in the villages, and the use of these
FinTech platforms is largely concentrated in the urban segment. This sector needs to make its way to smaller cities
and towns with and through awareness and financial literacy.
Road Ahead
• Strengthening foundational infrastructures: Foundational infrastructures include telecommunications, along with
digital and financial infrastructures (such as broadband internet, mobile data services, data repositories, and
payment and settlement services). The infrastructures should enable efficient data collection, processing, and
transmission, which are central in fintech advances.
• Conducive Policy framework: The successful and large-scale adoption of technology would be facilitated by an
enabling policy framework. Policymakers should address the risks of market concentration, and should foster
standardization, interoperability, and fair-and-transparent access to key infrastructures.
• Enhanced understanding of Evolving Financial Systems: This can be done by maintaining an ongoing dialogue with
the industry, both innovators and incumbents—to identify emerging opportunities and risks, and to facilitate the
timely formation of policy responses.
• Forging global alliances for smooth retail mobile payments of low value and high velocity: The government can
focus on partnering through an extension of UPI networks or forging global alliances with neighbouring governments
and regulators. These partnerships can enable social and inclusive use cases such as remittances for people visiting
India for medical reasons etc.
• Focus on targeted digital literacy programmes: The government can focus on creating awareness on mobile
payments through regional language advertisements and systematically planned digital literacy programmes. The
programmes can focus on areas such as cybersecurity in payments to increase level of trust in mobile payments.
o The government can also collaborate with industry players to build consensus and harmonise standards of visual
representation of payment systems in rural hinterlands to improve both merchant and end customer experience.
34 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o To build digital payment literacy at a young age, basic digital payment literacy concepts can be incorporated in
school curriculums.
• Other measures:
o Adapt Regulatory Framework and Supervisory Practices for Orderly Development and Stability of the Financial
System and facilitate the safe entry of new products, activities, and intermediaries; sustain trust and confidence;
and respond to risks.
o Safeguard the Integrity of Financial Systems by identifying, understanding, assessing, and mitigating the risks of
criminal misuse of fintech, and by using technologies that strengthen compliance with anti-money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures.
o Modernize Legal Frameworks to Provide an Enabling Legal Landscape with greater legal clarity and certainty
regarding key aspects of fintech activities.
3.4. SERVICES DOMESTIC REGULATIONS (SDR)
Why in News?
Recently, 67 member countries of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) concluded their negotiations on
Services Domestic Regulations (SDR).
Trade in Services and General Agreement on Trade in
Services (GATS)
Services sector is a dynamic and fastest-growing sector of
the global economy, representing 60% of world GDP in
value-added terms and over 50% of employment.
• The International Trade Rules on Services are
governed by GATS, an outcome of Uruguay Round
and entering into force in January 1995.
• It provides a framework of rules governing services
trade on all services (with two exceptions only). The
exceptions are:
○ Services supplied in the exercise of governmental
authority, and
○ Coverage measures affecting air traffic rights and
services directly related to the exercise of Air
Transport Services.
• GATS is applicable to four-modes of supplying services
(as given in Image) and establishes a mechanism for
all WTO members (to varying degree) to make
commitments to liberalize trade in services, and
• The agreement provides a mechanism for resolving
disputes between countries.
Services Domestic Regulation (SDR) and its Potential
Benefits
Launched at the 11th
Ministerial Conference at Buenos Aires (2017), the new plurilateral agreement is the first set of
rules on services in 24 years at WTO.
• Membership: The 67 agreed members include both developed and developing countries, together accounting for
over 90% of world trade such as the USA, China, European Union (EU), Brazil, etc.
• Incorporation methodology:
35 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o The new disciplines under it will be incorporated as additional commitments by the member’s services
commitments under GATS Schedules (GATS Article XVIII).
o The signatories have agreed to leave the pact open for other countries to join in and apply it on a “Most-Favored
Nation (MFN)” basis, i.e., giving equal treatment to countries that are not parties to the agreement as given to
parties to the agreement.
• Potential Benefits:
o With cost-of-service trade estimated to be twice as high as trade costs for goods, SDR works on reducing the costs
attributable to regulatory divergence and opaque regulations.
o It will also check cumbersome procedures though its objectives, means etc. as given in image.
o As a unique feature of the agreement, these rules contain provisions on non-discrimination between men and
women. It will support women empowerment and boost women’s participation in services trade.
Concerns over SDR by nations like India
Though aimed at creating a more transparent operating environment, slash administrative costs and offer benefit to all
WTO membership, it is opposed by other nations as:
• It establishes a competing and parallel mechanism to pursue and achieve same objectives without the entire WTO
membership consent.
• GATS allows the member countries to determine the extent of market access they will grant in various service sectors
and treat the Foreign Service providers differently. New disciplines will further deny market access to short-term
service providers,
o E.g. US, Canada, and EU have restricted market access to independent professionals and used Mode 4 to deny
market access to short-term services.
• It can be used to bring in rules to erect barriers to services trade and cross-border movement of professionals
through qualification and licensing requirements, and technical standards.
• Working Party on Domestic Regulation (WPDR) was established in 1999 (under Article VI:4 of GATS) precisely to put
these disciplines- domestic regulations (qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards, and licensing
requirements) from constituting unnecessary barriers to trade
36 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
Conclusion
The new disciplines address a dynamic and fast-growing segment of global output through easy availability of
information on Qualifications, processes for applying and obtaining the licenses, clarity on reasons for rejection of
application, and technical standards affecting trade in services.
As of 2020, more than 70% of WTO members have concluded at least one Regional Trade Agreement with provisions on
domestic regulations going beyond GATS. Therefore, there is a need for lesser hesitation on a more objective,
reasonable and impartial agreement to consolidate good regulatory practices within the WTO legal framework.
3.5. GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX RATE
Why in News?
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
released Pillar Two model rules for domestic implementation of 15%
global minimum tax.
About Global Minimum Tax Rate
• It requires countries to impose a minimum tax on large multinational companies (MNCs) (such as Google, Amazon,
Facebook and Apple (GAFA)) to counter efforts by such firms to escape taxes in their country of operations.
• It will undercut any advantage of shifting to lower-tax places and pressures countries to conform to the global norm.
o Large MNCs have traditionally been taxed based on where they declare their profits rather than where they
actually do business.
o This allowed several large companies to avoid paying high taxes in countries where they do most of their
business by shifting their profits to low-tax jurisdictions.
• Global Minimum Tax is part of the inclusive framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) agreed upon by
G20 countries and OECD.
• Global Minimum Tax will apply to MNCs with revenue above €750 million and it aims for developing a taxation
structure that is relevant for a digital and globalised world.
OECD and Global Minimum Tax
• Under the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), 139 countries and jurisdictions are
collaborating to put an end to tax avoidance strategies arising from digitalisation and globalisation of the economy.
o BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by MNCs that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift
profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity, resulting in little or no overall corporate
tax being paid.
• Recently, over 130 countries, including India, have joined a new two-pillar plan to reform international taxation rules and
ensure that
multinational
enterprises pay a fair
share of tax wherever
they operate.
• Now, OECD released
Pillar Two model rules
for domestic
implementation of 15%
global minimum tax.
• Model rules provide
governments a precise
template for taking
forward the two-pillar
solution and set out
the mechanism for GloBE rules and will assist countries to bring GloBE rules into domestic legislation in 2022.
o GloBE rules provide for taxation system to ensure large Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) groups pay this minimum level
of tax on income arising in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
Did you Know
• The average global corporate tax rate was
over 40% in the early 1980s and dropped to
well below 25% in 2020 as governments
competed against each other to lower their
tax rates in order to attract businesses.
37 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o Rules create a “top-up tax” to be applied on profits in any jurisdiction whenever the effective tax rate is below minimum
15% rate.
Challenges
• Global consensus: small economies
benefited a lot from attracting
investments with low corporate tax
as large and developed economies
have a considerable advantage
because of better infrastructure
quality, labor quality, economic and
political stability etc.
• Impact on socio-economic
development: All countries run
various tax incentives to attract
MNCs which are a source of FDI and
help to generate demand with
efficient utilisation of resources and
create employment.
• Consensus on tax rate: World
Inequality Report has suggested that
15% rate is lower than what working-
Implication on India
• Experts believe the tax would be advantageous for India as the effective
domestic tax rate is above the threshold and India, being a large potential
market, would continue to attract foreign investments.
• The tax deal will mean removal of existing digital service taxes and other
unilateral measures by 2023. India will need to withdraw the equalization
levy that was introduced in 2016.
o India will get additional taxing rights which are beneficial but the exact
quantum will need to be compared to domestic equalisation levy.
• Large Indian headquartered MNEs may also need to comply with Pillar One
rules and India will need to share its taxing right with other countries.
• It is also likely to negate any treaty benefit to achieve minimum taxation.
• India could end up losing revenue from other not-so-digitised companies in
the top 100.
• In respect of outbound investments, it will prevent base erosion of tax in the
country as the government will be able to claw back any shortfall in tax paid
below 15 % by an overseas business owned by an Indian resident.
• However, India, which has been an important market for these companies,
needs to insist for a greater share of profits to be allocated to countries that
are important markets for these tech firms.
38 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
class and middle class people typically pay in high-income countries. It is also lower than the average statutory rate
that corporations face in those places.
• Reduced ability to pursue specific policy objectives: Governments use tax incentives to pursue specific policy
objectives, such as promoting innovative activities or economic development, for instance, via investment tax
incentives or tax incentives for research and development.
• Favoring rich nations: As per Oxfam report, G7 and EU will take home two-thirds of new cash that GMT will bring in,
while the world’s poorest countries will recover less than 3%, despite being home to more than a third of the world’s
population.
• Ban on unilateral taxes: Many developing countries have expressed concerns about the implementation of these new
taxing rules being conditioned upon them removing all unilateral taxes on technology companies.
o Many countries earn significant revenue by levying tax on digital services.
Conclusion
A global minimum tax is a laudable attempt to make international tax arrangements fairer and work better in a
digitalised and globalised world economy.
However, there are major obstacles that may impede the overall implementation of the agreement.
There is a need to support this effort to build a consensus as countries, rich and poor, need more resources to fight the
pandemic and the consequent economic fallouts.
3.6. PM-KISAN
Why in news?
According to agriculture ministry, since 2019, about Rs 374.78 crore amount is pending for reprocessing after failed
transactions occurred under PM-KISAN scheme.
More about news
• The scheme saw a 14.22 lakh pending failed transaction during 2019-20 fiscal. In the ongoing 2021-22 fiscal, the
number of pending failed transactions stood at 9.11 lakh till November 2021.
• Number of failed transactions is less than one per cent of the total number of transactions under the scheme.
• Under the scheme, more than 11.60 crore farmers have been given the financial benefits of approximately Rs 1.60
lakh crore through various instalments since the launch of the scheme.
About the scheme
• Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman
Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is a central
Sector scheme launched in
December 2018 with 100%
funding from Government of
India.
• It provides to each eligible
farmer’s family Rs 6000 per
annum in three instalments of Rs
2000 each. Definition of family
for the scheme is husband, wife
and minor children.
• Initially, farmers with less than 2
hectares of land were eligible.
However, from June 2019 it was
extended to all farmers i.e. 140
million farmers.
Exclusion criteria for PM-KISAN scheme
All Institutional Land holders and Farmer families which belong to one or more of the
following categories have been excluded:
• Former and present holders of constitutional posts;
• Former and present Ministers/ State Ministers and former/present Members of
LokSabha/ RajyaSabha/ State Legislative Assemblies/ State Legislative Councils,
former and present Mayors of Municipal Corporations, former and present
Chairpersons of District Panchayats;
• All serving or retired officers and employees of Central/ State Government
Ministries /Offices/Departments and its field units and regular employees of the
Local Bodies (Excluding Multi-Tasking Staff /Class IV/Group D employees);
• All superannuated/retired pensioners whose monthly pension is Rs.10,000/-or
more (Excluding Multi-Tasking Staff / Class IV/Group D employees) of above
category);
• All Persons who paid Income Tax in last assessment year;
• Professionals like Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers, Chartered Accountants, and
Architects registered with Professional bodies and carrying out profession by
undertaking practices.
39 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• The responsibility to identify the farmer families which are eligible for support as per scheme guidelines lies with
respective State Government and UT administration. The fund is directly transferred to the bank accounts of the
beneficiaries.
• There are various Exclusion Categories (Refer box) for the scheme.
Why PM-KISAN is better than other subsidy schemes?
• Direct Income support: The scheme aims to provide income support to farmers by addressing the liquidity constraints
of farmers for meeting their expenses for acquisition of agricultural inputs and services.
• Verification of data: The data received on the PM-KISAN web portal goes through various levels of verification and
validation, including Aadhar and income tax databases.
• No selection bias: Such schemes are often subject to elite capture and selection biases. However, IFPRI-ICAR study
depicted there was no selection bias in terms of social, economic, and farming characteristics. 30% of farmers
received the income benefit within three months of the scheme’s implementation.
o Banking infrastructure created through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), played a key role in the funds’
disbursement.
• Compatible with WTO norms: The scheme assumes importance as India’s farm subsidy and export subsidy are
increasingly being challenged at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for violating multilateral trading rules. Direct
income support is considered part of the Green Box at WTO.
Issues with the scheme
• Insufficient amount: Given that India’s poverty line is ₹32 per person per day in rural areas and ₹47 in urban areas,
according to the Rangarajan Committee, the income support of ₹17 a day for a household (offered by PM-KISAN), is
largely insufficient for even bare minimum sustenance of vulnerable farmers.
• Neglect of lessee cultivators and sharecroppers: PM KISAN has not explicitly mentioned the benefits accruing to
lessee cultivators or sharecroppers. Though KALIA scheme in Odisha offers benefit of Rs. 10,000 per sharecropper /
lease holder per year, identification of tenant farmers remains a huge challenge there.
• Concerns of data inconsistencies in identification of beneficiaries: In light of fact that many states have incomplete
tenancy records and land data are not digitised, identification of beneficiaries is daunting.
o Results of a joint study conducted by NITI Aayog and Department of Food in 2016 suggest that the government’s
pilot programmes to replace subsidised food grains with cash in three Union Territories have failed due to data
inconsistencies.
• Failed transactions: There are several reasons for transaction's failure under the PM-KISAN scheme, such as account
closed or transferred, invalid IFSC code, account inactive, account dormant, amount exceeding the limit set on
account by the bank for credit/debit per transaction, among others.
• Many beneficiaries left out: Study done in Andhra Pradesh has shown that about 29% of the farmer beneficiaries of
the scheme in the State have not received their full benefits. Further, good number of bank rejection cases and
‘State action required’ cases were unresolved for three to 18 months.
Road Ahead
• Adequate cash transfer: To be effective, any cash transfer scheme should ensure that there is enough cash provided
to help bring an affected community out of poverty. For instance, the Rythu Bandhu in Telangana provides ₹4,000
per acre to each farmer in each season.
o Also, Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation scheme in Odisha offers ₹5,000 for a farm
family over five seasons, among other benefits.
• Index transfers with inflation: Given the volatile market and price fluctuations in different regions, it is important
to index the cash transfers to local inflation. The failure of Direct Benefit Transfer in kerosene in Rajasthan is a case
in point, where the cash transferred to families has been insufficient to purchase kerosene, as the market price
increased substantially.
• Better timing of providing benefits: IFPRI-ICAR study found that farmers receiving instalments in the agricultural
peak season are more likely to spend it on agriculture, and those getting it in the off-season are more likely to spend
it on consumption. Thus timing of benefits has implications on spending patterns.
40 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Multiplier effects: Study has found that by investing more in agricultural advisory services, the government can
encourage farmers to invest some or all part of the income support in productive assets for achieving the multiplier
effect of PM-KISAN. Therefore, PM-KISAN along with agricultural advisory services has the potential to break the cycle
of intergenerational poverty.
• Strengthening IT backbone: States with robust computerized land records data base and a good IT infrastructure are
in a better position to implement PM-KISAN. Farmers not having bank accounts should be encouraged to open ‘no-frills’
accounts under the Jan-Dhan Yojana.
• Investing in infrastructure and R&D: Any income support scheme can’t cover all the farm households and therefore,
enhancing investments in rural infrastructure (roads; irrigation, marketing infrastructure, etc.) and agri R&D would
have long-term outcomes in raising farm incomes.
3.7. COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR GENERAL (CAG) REPORT ON INDIAN
RAILWAYS
Why in news?
Recently, CAG report on the Indian Railways’ (IR)
finances tabled in Parliament paints a grim picture
based on earnings, expenditure, reserves and
operational efficiency.
Key Highlights of the report
• Decrease in receipts: Total Receipts decreased by
8.30% in 2019-20 as compared to 6.47% increase in
2018-19.
• Cross-Subsidization: Profits from freight traffic
were utilised to compensate for the loss on
operation of passenger and other coaching services.
• Coal dependence: Heavy dependence on
transportation of coal which constituted around
49% of the total freight earnings during 2019-20.
Any shift in bulk commodities transport pattern
could affect the freight earnings significantly.
• Operating Ratio (OR): OR deteriorated to 98.36%
in 2019-20 from 97.29% in 2018-19. Due to less appropriation to Pension Fund, Railways could show surplus and
higher OR.
o OR is the ratio of the working expenditure (expenses arising from day-to-day operations of Railways) to the
revenue earned from traffic.
o A higher ratio indicates a poorer ability to
generate surplus that can be used for
capital investments.
• Capital Output Ratio (COR): COR increased in
2019-20, indicates the decrease in physical
performance of the IR as compared to capital
employed.
o COR indicates the amount of capital
employed to produce one unit of output.
• Decline in internal resources: Contribution of
internal resources for capital projects
declined resulting in greater dependence on
Gross Budgetary support (GBS) and Extra
budgetary resources (EBR).
Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India
• The CAG is an independent authority established under
Article 148 and appointed by President.
• He is the head of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department.
• He is the guardian of the public purse and controls the entire
financial system of the country at the Centre and state level.
• The administrative expenses of the office of CAG are charged
upon the Consolidated Fund of India.
• CAG shall not be eligible for further office.
• CAG is fulfilling the role of an Auditor-General only and not
that of a Comptroller.
• Its main role is to audit and check accounts relating to all
Union & state government departments and offices,
including Railways, Posts and Telecoms.
o It also scrutinises the accounts of companies owned or
financed by the government.
• CAG submits three audit reports to the President:
o Appropriation accounts
o Finance accounts
o Public undertakings
41 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o IR has three primary sources of revenue:
✓ GBS includes the sum it gets from the Central Government’s budget allocation each year.
✓ Internal Resources includes freight and passenger revenue and leasing of railway land.
✓ EBR includes borrowings, earnings through partnerships and institutional finance.
• Staff productivity: Deterioration in staff productivity in 2019-20 was due to decline in freight carried (tonnage) and
passenger originating (total distance carried/ travelled).
Other issues associated with Indian Railways
• Operating Efficiency: Indian railways has a
huge employee base which includes
powerful workers' unions and become is a
centralised organisation with hierarchical
decision-making. As a result, even simple
decisions take years to resolve.
• Outdated technology: The quality of railway
services and technology usage is very poor.
The existing technology of both electric and
diesel locomotive is considerably old.
• Low investment: Poor finances of Railways
had led to low investment, leading to poor
services and issues like low speed, delays,
and safety concerns, resulting in loss of
remunerative business for Railways which
has led to further deterioration of finances.
This has become a vicious cycle for Railways.
• Project pendency: Projects are delayed for
years due to inefficient work force and
uncertainty in the availability of funds.
Moreover, there is a constant pressure to
undertake new project.
• Infrastructure: The biggest constraint that
railways face today is of inadequate
network capacity and infrastructure with
the increase in traffic output thus, there is a
huge congestion of the system.
• Increase in competition: The competition
with road and airline transport is growing in
intensity and the lack of coordination
between railways and road transport has
lowered the earning capacity of the railways.
Beside this, without ticket journey also
makes heavy losses for railway department.
• Common corridor: There is a common
corridor for both freight and passenger
traffic. Passenger trains are given
importance over running of freight trains
leading to financial losses.
Way forward
• Infrastructure: The government should undertake a massive infrastructure expansion and decongestion programme
with up-gradation of technology and judicious electrification of tracks along with enhancement of terminal capacity.
Steps taken by government to improve Indian Railways
• PM Gati Shakti- National Master Plan for Multi-modal Connectivity:
To bring Railways and Roadways together for integrated planning and
coordinated implementation of infrastructure connectivity projects.
• National rail Plan (NRP) 2030: To develop infrastructure by 2030 to
cater to the traffic requirements up to 2050 and increase modal share
of rail in freight to 45%.
o Vision 2024 has been launched for accelerated implementation
of certain critical projects by 2024 such as 100% electrification,
multi-tracking of congested routes etc.
• Encourage private entities: Bibek Debroy Committee, 2015 had
recommended private entry into running both freight and passenger
trains in competition with Indian railways should be allowed.
• Rail Development Authority (RDA): Centre approved setting up RDA,
an independent regulator to recommend passenger and freight fares
and set service level benchmarks.
• Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs): To faster transportation of goods
and reduced logistic cost and improved supply chain efficiency.
• Bharat Gaurav Trains scheme: To showcase the country’s rich cultural
heritage as well as magnificent historical places to the public.
• Miscellaneous E-Receipts System (MERS) portal: To facilitate digital
payments of inward receipts to Railways.
42 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Technology: There is need for introduction of technology with higher horsepower electric and diesel locomotives
which are more fuel efficient. It is also necessary to build a technology base of the country to achieve self-sufficiency
in railway sector.
• Diversify freight basket: There is need to take steps to diversify their freight basket to enhance freight earnings and
also exploit its idle assets to increase other earnings.
• Improve service quality: To keep railway stations and trains clean, punishable law can be introduced along with
improving food quality and amenities at railway station, train coaches etc.
• Revisit tariffs: It is imperative to revisit the passenger and other coaching tariffs so as to recover the cost of operations
in a phased manner and reduce its losses in its core activities.
3.8. NEWS IN SHORTS
3.8.1. GUIDELINES FOR CENTRAL PUBLIC
SECTOR ENTERPRISE (CPSE)
DISINVESTMENT RELEASED BY
MINISTRY OF FINANCE
• Guidelines are aimed at privatisation, merger, closure
or subsidiarisation of non-strategic CPSEs to
implement new PSE Policy.
• Key provisions
o Department of Public Enterprises to identify
CPSEs for closure or privatization in non-strategic
sectors and prepare note for Cabinet Committee
on Economic Affairs approval.
o Once approved, disinvestment or closure process
to be completed within seven months.
• Disinvestment typically refers to selling or liquidating
an asset or subsidiary either as a strategic move or for
raising resources. It is also referred to as ‘divestment’
or ‘divestiture’.
• Main objectives are to reduce financial burden on
government, introduce, competition and market
discipline, encourage wider share of ownership etc.
• Based on the percentage of stake sale, it is of three
types:
o Minority disinvestment: government retains a
majority stake (more than 51%) and management
control. E.g. ONGC Limited.
o Strategic disinvestment: Sale of 50% or even
higher portion of the government shareholding,
along with transfer of management control. E.g.
planned sale of BPCL.
o Complete disinvestment: Majority disinvestment
where 100% control of the company is passed on
to a buyer. E.g. recent sale of Air India.
• New Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) Policy
o Notified in February 2021 for Atmanirbhar Bharat,
new policy classified CPSEs into strategic and non-
strategic sectors with exemption to certain CPSEs
which are not for profit or support the vulnerable
and weaker sections.
3.8.2. PAYMENTS BANK

scheduled bank status by the Reserve Bank of India.
Benefits of getting scheduled bank status
• Scheduled banks refer to those banks which have been
included in the Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of
India Act, 1934.
o Other payments banks that have been added are
Fino Payments Bank and India Post Payments
Bank.
• With the scheduled bank status, Paytm Payments Bank
can explore new business opportunities, take part in
Request for Proposals issued by the government and
other large corporations, primary auctions, fixed-rate
and variable rate repos and reverse repos.
• It can also participate in Marginal Standing Facility and
will be eligible to partner in government-run financial
inclusion schemes.
43 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• It is now eligible for refinancing facility from the RBI at
the bank rate, acquire membership to clearing house,
and get access to currency storage facility.
About Payments Bank
• They were created on recommendations of RBI’s
Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for
Small Businesses and Low Income Households headed
by Nachiket Mor in 2013.
• It is registered under Companies Act, 2013 and licensed
under Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
o A Promoter / promoter group can also have Joint
Venture with an existing scheduled commercial
bank.
• It has to maintain Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) with RBI and
invest in eligible government securities/ treasury bills
under Statutory Liquid Ratio (SLR).
• It can access inter-bank uncollateralised call money
market and collateralized repo and CBLO market for
temporary liquidity management.
• Minimum paid-up equity capital of the payments bank is
INR 100 crores and it is required to maintain a minimum

3.8.3. IRDAI RETAINS LIC, GIC, NEW
INDIA AS DOMESTIC SYSTEMICALLY
IMPORTANT INSURERS (D-SIIS)
• Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), General
Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) and New India
have been identified, like in 2020-21, as D-SIIs for
2021-22.
o D-SIIs are identified on an annual basis by
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority
of India (IRDAI).
• D-SIIs refer to insurers of such size, market importance
and domestic and global inter connectedness, whose
distress or failure would cause a significant dislocation
in the domestic financial system.
o Their continued functioning is thus critical for the
uninterrupted availability of insurance services to
the national economy.
o They are perceived as insurers ‘too big or too
important to fail’.
• Parameters for identification of D-SIIs
o Size of operations in terms of total revenue,
including premium underwritten and value of
assets under management.
o Global activities across more than one jurisdiction.
• Due to their importance, D-SIIs are subjected to
additional regulatory measures to deal with the
systemic risks and moral hazard issues.
• Similarly, RBI identifies domestic systemically
important banks (D-SIBs) or banks that are considered
as “too big to fail”.
o SBI, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank are identified as D-
SIBs for 2020-21.
3.8.4. SEBI SEEKING TO REGULATE ALGO
TRADING
• Algorithmic trading or Algo trading is a computer
assisted buying and selling of stocks.
o Under it, pre-programmed computer strategies
execute buy and sell trades depending on set
parameters, instructions or market pattern and
conditions.
o Around 50 per cent of the daily trading volume in
Indian stock markets is through an advanced form
of algo trading.
• Benefits of Algo-trading: It can place high-volume
orders at high speed, reduction of transaction costs,
can identify differently priced stocks, avoid significant
price changes, highly accurate without any human
errors.
• Need to regulate
o Algo trading came to India in 2008, but in 2015, it
was revealed that NSE gave preferential access to
a few algo traders.
o Can be misused for systematic market
manipulation and to lure retail investors by
guaranteeing them higher returns.
• Concerns regarding regulation
o Algo trading volumes could fall once the proposed
SEBI norms are implemented, since approval of
pre-programmed trading strategies could be a
complex affair.
o All algo strategies may not be approved by the
exchanges due to their complex nature.
44 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o Submitting algo programmes to exchanges for
their approval would mean that vendors may have
to reveal their formula.
3.8.5. WHOLESALE INFLATION
Wholesale inflation, based on the Wholesale Price
Index, jumped to 14.23% in 2021 from 12.54% in 2020 (on
a year-on-year basis).
More on News
• This is the highest WPI rate in the 2011-12 series and
has remained in double digits for the 8th
consecutive
month.
• This is reflective of manufacturers passing on the
higher input costs to their output prices. Fuel
continues to push up input cost pressure, despite
recent reduction in taxes on fuel.
• Rising inflation has raised fears that it may translate
into elevated retail or consumer price-based inflation
in short term.
• Factors responsible for rising inflation
o The high rate of inflation in 2021 is primarily due to
rise in prices of mineral oils, basic metals, crude
petroleum & natural gas, chemicals and chemical
products, food products etc.
o Since fuel is a major input into transportation cost,
higher fuel prices push up the distribution cost
further.
o Input price pressures and supply-side shortages
are pushing up prices at the consumer level and
may further impact demand.
o The risks from the new Omicron variant are also
expected to push up global commodity prices.
o Recent depreciation of Rupee in Forex market has
also contributed to higher Wholesale Inflation.
Wholesale Price Index
• It measures average change in the prices of commodities
for bulk sale at the level of early stage of transactions.
• The index basket of the WPI covers commodities falling
under the 3 Major Groups namely Primary Articles, Fuel
and Power and Manufactured products.
• The prices tracked are ex- factory price for manufactured
products, agri-market (mandi) price for agricultural
commodities and ex-mines prices for minerals.
• Weights given to each commodity covered in the WPI
basket is based on the value of production adjusted for
net imports. WPI basket does not cover services.
• It is released by Office of the Economic Adviser,
Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal
Trade.
• The base year of All-India WPI has been revised from
2004-05 to 2011-12.
o A significant change in the new series of WPI has been
the exclusion of indirect taxes while compiling
indices of manufactured products.
o Rationale behind it is that price signals emerging
from production side of the economy are not
influenced by the fiscal policy.
3.8.6. INCENTIVE SCHEME TO PROMOTE
RUPAY DEBIT CARDS APPROVED
• Cabinet approved an incentive scheme worth ₹1,300
crore for promotion of RuPay debit cards and low-
value (up to ₹2,000) BHIM-UPI transactions (person-
to-merchants(P2M)).
• Under the scheme, acquiring banks will be
incentivised, by way of paying percentage of value of
transactions (P2M) done through RuPay Debit cards
and BHIM-UPI modes of payments.
• Benefits of the scheme
o Will facilitate acquiring Banks in building robust
digital payment ecosystem.
o Help in making accessible digital modes of
payments to unbanked and marginalized
populations.
3.8.7. MIS (MANAGEMENT INFORMATION
SYSTEM) PORTAL
• Department of Land Resources developed MIS portal
for rankings of States/UTs in Land Acquisition Projects
under Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act,
2013.
o In the first phase, land acquisition undertaken
from 01.01.2014 onwards will be covered for
ranking purposes.
• Ranking will make it easier for states to monitor the
progress of the developmental projects and will help in
increasing speed of the projects.
3.8.8. ULIP HACKATHON– LOGIXTICS
• Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal
Trade (DPIIT) has launched the Unified Logistics
Interface Platform’s (ULIP) Hackathon – ‘LogiXtics’.
• About ULIP Hackathon:
o It is organised by NITI Aayog and Atal Innovation
Mission and supported by others to
crowdsource ideas which will benefit logistics
industry.
o ULIP is designed to enhance efficiency and
reduce logistics cost in India by creating a
transparent platform that can provide real time
information to all stakeholders and remove all
asymmetry information.
o ULIP will bring more transparency and visibility
to the whole trade making India logistically more
efficient and competitive.
45 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
3.8.9. NSE PRIME
• National Stock Exchange (NSE) has launched a new
corporate governance initiative ‘NSE Prime’.
• About NSE Prime:
o It is a framework that prescribes higher standards
of corporate governance for listed companies
than those required by regulations.
o All the NSE-listed companies can adopt NSE Prime
voluntarily.
o Benefits:
✓ Will raise the bar for corporate governance
standards in India,
✓ Enable investors to identify companies that
have voluntarily signed up for higher standards
of corporate governance,
✓ Broaden the quality of investors in listed
companies etc.
3.8.10. CARD TOKENISATION
• RBI has deferred the implementation of tokenisation
of cards for online transactions by six months i.e., till
June 30, 2022.
o The decision came after receiving various
representations on the card tokenisation
guidelines.
• Tokenisation is a process by which card details are
replaced by a unique code or token, allowing online
purchases to go through without exposing card details.
• It will help in improving data security.
46 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
4. SECURITY
4.1. EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
Why in News?
Recently, Union Home Minister said that indigenously made anti-drone
technology would soon be available to tackle the challenges faced by
drones in areas bordering Pakistan.
More on News
• As drones from Pakistan continue to pose a threat in the border areas,
the country’s security agencies have been discussing measures to
deal with the arising situation.
o Recently, Air Force Station Jammu was attacked by low-flying
drones that carried Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
Technology and Security
• Leadership in technological innovation historically has been a crucial national security asset for major global powers.
• Development and introduction of weapons such as modern small arms, nuclear weapons, stealth technology, and
guided missiles altered the security equation and, in some instances, transformed international relations.
Emerging
Technology
Possible Benefits Possible Threat
Drones/
Unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAV)
• UAVs have been used extensively for various
purposes like aerial photography and
filmmaking, rescue operations, wildfire
mapping, crowd monitoring, etc.
• UAV could be used to conduct reconnaissance,
to spoof, distract or desensitize security forces.
Remotely
operated
weapons systems
(ROWS)
• Enhanced Surveillance (chemical and bio
detection sensors, drones etc.)
• Cyber infiltrators could gain access to control
systems and change the parameters of who is
allowed in a given area and who is considered a
threat thereby facilitate theft or sabotage.
Artificial
intelligence (AI)
• Counter terrorism and law enforcement
informatics via predictive analytics and AI.
• Automated, AI powered cyberattacks; risk of
over-reliance on and over-complication of these
systems; possibility that terrorists and other
adversaries will employ AI to help them plan
and conduct more efficient physical attacks etc.
Cyber Technology • Enhanced security at nuclear power facilities and
other complex industrial sites
• Increased risk of hacking, disruption, and
potential for sabotage of critical infrastructure.
Enhanced Human
Performance
• Includes a wide variety of focus, memory and
emotion manipulating neuropharmaceuticals
(nootropics), physical performance-enhancing
drugs etc.
• This might enable new ways to covertly perform
reconnaissance, interface with computer
systems or communicate with collaborators.
Increasing use of
outer space for
defence and
security
• Plays a role in States’ intelligence; surveillance
and reconnaissance; troop movement tracking
on land, at sea, and in the air; classified and
unclassified telecommunications; GPS-guided
weapons; cyber-warfare etc.
• Expected introduction of directed energy
weapons (DEW) and possible increase in the
military exploitation of satellite systems for
combat purposes.
Changing face of National security due to Emerging Technologies
• Newer Threats: New technologies and novel applications of existing technologies have the potential to disrupt labor
markets and alter health, energy, and transportation systems.
• Limited regulation: Technological innovation is largely taking place beyond the purview of governments. In many
cases, the rate of innovation is outpacing states’ ability to keep abreast of the latest developments and their potential
societal impacts.
Emerging Technologies
• It commonly refers to technologies that
are currently developing, or that are
expected to be available within the next
five to ten years, and is usually reserved
for technologies that are creating, or are
expected to create, significant social or
economic effects.
• It includes technologies like artificial
intelligence, machine learning, natural
language processing, 3D printing,
blockchain, robotic process automation
and Internet of Things.
47 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Powerful adversaries: Emerging technology will also allow our adversaries to more readily develop weapon systems
that can strike farther, faster, and harder and challenge India in all warfare domains, including space.
• Threat from Non-state actors: Rapid and profound advances in hardware and software, paired with the global shift
to digitally networked communications and transactions, have increased collective vulnerability to malicious states
and non-state actors.
o Groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS
used online communication on
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and
other platforms to increase their
prominence and recruit
collaborators.
• More potent terrorist threats:
Potential for terrorists to acquire a
nuclear weapon (or weapons-usable
material) to compromise the safety of
a facility housing nuclear material
and/or other critical infrastructure.
• Threat of weapons of mass
destruction (WMD): Hostile nations,
realizing that they cannot stand up to
technologically superior military
forces, will be stimulated to develop
WMD as an offset to these capabilities.
Way forward
• Incentivizing investors and corporations to consider national security in their decision-making process while initiating
partnerships/programs to foster innovation.
• Multilateral governance system involving a greater number and variety of actors to initiate, shape, and implement
both technical and normative solutions.
• More partnerships and collaborative environments to share worldwide emerging technology trends, address
competitive threats, share national security concerns, and consider civil liberties, privacy, and ethical implications.
• Forming strategic public-private partnerships with the aim of allocating private capital to support national security
objectives.
• Develop and adopt advanced technology applications within government and improve the desirability of the
government as a customer of the private sector.
4.2. CLIMATE CHANGE AND SECURITY
Why in News?
India voted against a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) draft
resolution that for the first time would have defined climate change as
a threat to peace.
More on the news
• The Security Council draft resolution was co-sponsored by 113 UN
Member States and tabled by Ireland and Niger, the council’s
current president.
• It was aimed at systematically integrating climate-related security
risks into the UN’s conflict prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding work.
• The vote on the resolution in the 15-member council was 12 in favor, with Russia and India opposed and China
abstaining.
Steps taken by India
• In 2015, National Supercomputing Mission was launched to install 73
indigenous supercomputers throughout the country by 2022.
• National Mission on Quantum Technologies & Applications was
announced in 2020 to oversee the development of quantum technologies
for communications, computing, materials development and cryptography.
• DRDO has also established several dedicated laboratories focusing on
futuristic technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum and cognitive
technologies, asymmetric technologies and smart materials.
• Indian military is reportedly developing advanced military systems such as
directed energy weapons (DEWs), optionally manned combat platforms and
swarm drones.
• Ministry of External Affairs recently (MEA) created a New, Emerging and
Strategic Technologies (NEST) division to deal with the foreign policy and
international legal aspects of new and emerging technologies.
• India has a Defence Cyber Agency and a National Technical Research
Organisation, which are responsible for mechanisms that work to counter
cyber risks and threats to the country.
• Hand-held Thermal Imagers have been provided to Indian security
forces and being used everywhere including, manning the International
Border (IB) and the Line of Control (LoC).
About UNSC
• It is one of the six principal organs of the
United Nations (UN).
• Its primary responsibility is maintenance of
international peace and security.
• It has 15 Members, ten elected members,
and five permanent members--China, the
United States, France, the United Kingdom,
and the Russian Federation.
• Each member has one vote, but permanent
members have the power to veto any
substantive resolution.
48 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o Because Russia is one of the council’s five veto-wielding permanent members, its negative vote blocked passage.
Need of the resolution
• Interlinkage between Climate change and
security: Climate is creating security risks in the
world (see infographic), which will exacerbate in
the future with water shortage, migration and a
destruction of livelihoods.
o For example, people and countries most
vulnerable to climate change also are most
vulnerable to terrorist recruitment and
violence.
• Progress of UNFCCC conferences is slow and
outcomes are inadequate, leading to demand of
faster collective action to tackle climate change
and associated challenges.
• UNSC already has tools to address climate
change within its mandate: It is the principal
organ of the United Nations responsible for
international security and can ensure that the
security impacts of climate change are
integrated into the critical work of
peacekeeping, peacebuilding and humanitarian
response.
Concerns regarding resolution
• Viewing conflicts through the prism of climate
change is misleading and an oversimplification: While climate change has the potential to impact peace and security,
the nexus between the two is complex. This diverts the attention from genuine deep-rooted reasons for conflict in
some countries.
o For instance, other factors such as environmental degradation, food shortages and unfair distribution of resources
are most likely to lead to tension and conflict.
• Climate change lies outside the ambit of UNSC: UNSC’s primary responsibility is “maintenance of international peace
and security” and climate change-related issues are outside its ambit. All matters related to climate change are being
discussed in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a specialised agency.
• Lake of participative approach: Bringing the issue under the UNSC may give more powers to the world’s industrialised
countries, which hold a veto power, to decide on future action on climate-related security issues, unlike UNFCCC,
where decisions are made are by consensus.
Way forward
• UNFCCC can expand the scope of discussions to include climate-related security issues.
• International community must provide stronger support to climate change adaptation in developing countries,
including through investments in capacity-building at all levels.
• Enhance global efforts to ensure the sustainable and equitable development of all countries, notably through
developed countries’ meeting their international commitments on development assistance.
• Anticipate and prepare to address unprecedented challenges posed by climate change like e possibility of large
numbers of persons displaced across borders by climate change, prospect of statelessness of citizens of submerged
island nations, drastic reduction in water availability etc.
• Improve the flow of information and sharing of assessments, particularly on early warning, between different
regional and international organizations.

4.3. INTERNET SHUTDOWN
Why in news?
Report on ‘Suspension of Telecom Services/Internet
And Its Impact’ was presented in the parliament by
Standing Committee On Communications And
Information Technology (2021-22).
About Internet Shutdown & Rules related to internet
shutdown
• An Internet shutdown is an intentional disruption
of digital communications leading to little or no
access to the Internet.
o Shutdowns can take place nationally or target
a certain region.
o According to Software Freedom Law Centre
(SFLC) there have been a total of 550 internet
shutdowns in India so far since 2012.
• Reasons for Internet Shutdown
o to improve the law and order situation,
o bring peace, ensure security and stability of
the state.
o to stop the spread of fake news,
administrative convenience.
• Rules/legal provisions for Internet shutdown
o Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency & Public Safety) Rules, 2017.
✓ Currently, suspension of telecom services (including internet shutdowns) is governed by the 2017 Rules
notified under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.
✓ 2017 Rules provide for temporary shutdown of telecom services in a region on grounds of public emergency
(up to 15 days at once).
✓ 1885 Act empowers the central
government to regulate various types of
telecom services including internet
services and grant licenses for them.
o Supreme court in its 2020 judgment
✓ Directed for publishing of all orders for
suspension of telecom services to enable
the affected persons to challenge it before
the High Court
✓ Suspending internet services indefinitely is impermissible under the Rules, 2017.
✓ Order is subject to judicial review.
o In view of SC judgements, 2017 Rules have been amended in 2020 to ensure that any suspension order issued
under these rules shall not be in operation for more than fifteen days and that all such orders need to be
published.
Earlier before 2017 internet shutdowns were ordered under Cr.PC section 144, but SC has disallowed it.
Adverse impact of Internet Shutdowns
• Impact on businesses and service delivery
o India has more than 15 million WhatsApp Business users, a lot of whom are small and medium businesses. They
rely on digital modes of payment such as UPI.
Key observations by the committee on the 2017 rules
• Inadequate rules for Internet shutdown: No proper procedure
has been laid down for lifting of internet shutdown.
• Undefined Grounds for suspension of telecom services:
‘Public Emergency’ and ‘Public Safety’, the two grounds on
which internet shutdown can be ordered are both un-defined
in the 1885 Act or the 2017 Rules. .
o In the absence of parameters to decide the merit of the
internet shutdowns, shutdowns have been ordered purely
on the basis of subjective assessment by District level
officer.
• Use for other purposes: Shutdowns have been resorted to as a
tool for routine policing and even administrative purposes,
such as preventing cheating in exams to defusing local crime.
• No records for Internet shutdown: There are no records with
Home Affairs or Department of Telecom on how many states
have issued internet suspension orders, including their
details, reasons etc.
• Internet shutdown under Section 144: As opposed to ordering
shutdown under Suspension Rules, 2017, states have been
ordering shutdowns under Section 144, Cr. P.C. which was
clarified as being unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
• High Monetary loss due to Internet Shutdown: As per Cellular
Operators Association of India (COAI), telecom operators lose
INR 24.5 million per hour in every Circle Area where there is a
shutdown or throttling.
50 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o As per report by UK-based privacy and security research firm Top10VPN, Internet shutdowns in 2020 cost India
$2.8 bn, almost 70% of the total loss of $4 bn to the world economy.
• Impact government efforts of digitisation: Shutdowns during the lockdown has a major impact on education. As
learning for so many professional courses and competitions is being given online, an internet blackout impedes
learning opportunities.
• Violation of the rights of the citizens:
o Around 42% shutdowns in 2020 directly impeded human rights by abusing freedom of assembly, election
interference and infringement on freedom of press.
o Shutdown such as that imposed in J&K also bring into question the principle of democracy being curbed.
Recommendations made by Committee
• Regulation of suspension of telecom service
o Reviewing the Rules to address all aspects of internet shutdown
o Bringing the Rules in tune with changing technology to ensure minimum disturbance to the public,
o Issuing uniform guidelines for states/UTs, required to be followed while ordering an internet shutdown
• Grounds for suspension of telecom services:
o Codifying defined parameters that constitute as public emergency and public safety,
o Putting in place a mechanism to decide the merit of an internet shutdown.
o Maintain a centralised database of all internet shutdown orders in the country
• Others recommendations
o Ensure that internet shutdowns are resorted to as rarely as possible.
o DoT/MHA Department to lay down a clear cut principle of proportionality and procedure for lifting of shutdown
so that these are not extended indefinitely even when the situation comes under control.
o DoT to explore the option of banning of selective services, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. instead
of banning the internet as a whole.

5. ENVIRONMENT
5.1. BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2021
Why in News?
The Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was
recently introduced in Lok Sabha and then referred to a
joint parliamentary committee (JPC).
About Biological Diversity Act, 2002
• It was enacted to provide for the conservation of
biological diversity, sustainable use of its
components and fair and equitable sharing of the
benefits arising out of the use of biological
resources and knowledge.
• Aim: To fulfill India's obligations under the
Convention of Biological Diversity and Nagoya
Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing.
• It provides for a decentralised three-tiered
mechanism (see infographic) for implementation of
the Act.
• Biodiversity Management Committees (BMC) are
responsible for preparing People's Biodiversity
Registers which keep a record of all flora and fauna
including details of traditional knowledge available
in their region.
Key Provisions of the Proposed Amendments
• Extension of Exemptions: Registered AYUSH
medical Practitioners, people accessing codified
traditional knowledge, cultivated medicinal plants
and its products, people who are practicing
indigenous medicine including Indian systems of
medicine for sustenance and livelihood are
exempted from giving prior intimation to SBB for
accessing biological resource from certain
purposes.
• Simplifying access to biological resources and
intellectual property rights (IPR):
o Certain entities must seek approval from
the NBA for obtaining biological resources,
including organisations registered in India,
with any non-Indian shareholding or
management, which has been changed to
any foreign-controlled company registered
in India.
o Applicants can now obtain NBA’s approval
before the grant of IPR and not before
applying for IPR.
o Anyone who does not need approval from
NBA to access biological resources must
53 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
give prior intimation to the concerned SBB. Further, they must- register with the NBA before the grant of IPR,
and get prior approval of the NBA before commercialising the granted IPR.
• Reduction of certain offences: The provision which made offences under the act cognizable and non-bailable was
deleted. However, penalties may extend upto ₹1 crore.
• Provisions related to BMC: State government will prescribe the composition of BMCs, whose strength has been fixed
between seven to eleven members. Further, state governments may also constitute BMCs at the intermediate or
district Panchayat level.
• States can declare Threatened species: Central government can delegate the power to notify any species which is
near-extinction as a threatened species to the state government.
o However, before notifying any threatened species, the state government must consult the NBA.
• Expansion of NBA: 11 additional members to be added to NBA, including:
o 6 ex-officio members dealing with wildlife, forestry research, and Panchayati Raj
o 4 representatives from SBBs (on a rotational basis), and
o 1 Member-Secretary (must have experience in biodiversity conservation), who will be the chief coordinating
officer of the NBA.
• Changes in Definitions: For example, ‘bio-utilisation’ has been removed, and ‘bio-survey’ has been redefined.
Concerns regarding Amendments
• Allowing large companies to evade the requirement for prior
approval or sharing the benefits:
o Majority of the AYUSH firms are registered under the name of
the practising AYUSH doctors and excluding them could exempt
their companies as well.
o It is difficult to certify whether the raw material used by
companies came from the forest areas or cultivated lands.

What is access and benefit-sharing?
When an Indian or foreign company or
individual accesses biological resources such
as medicinal plants and associated knowledge,
it has to take prior consent from the national
biodiversity board. The board can impose a
benefit-sharing fee or royalty or impose
conditions so that the company shares the
monetary benefit from commercial utilisation
of these resources with local people who are
conserving biodiversity in the region.

resource and develop a product from it, and without the
NBA’s cognisance, any monetary benefits that arise from
sale of the product won’t reach the local communities.
• Issues regarding changes in definitions:
o Threat of Bio-piracy: Due to deletion of the term Bio-
utilisation, an array of activities like characterisation,
inventorisation and bioassay, which are undertaken with
commercial interest, may go undetected.
o Replacing ‘biological resources or knowledge’ with just
‘results of research’ may open channels for anyone who
has once obtained permission from the NBA to transfer the
biological resource or knowledge to any third party
without any restrictions or the cognisance of the NBA.
o Uncertainty regarding regulation of biosurveys: Studies
and tests that researchers use to understand physical,
chemical and other characteristics of a resource – say, a
plant or an insect – or the potency of a substance (by measuring its effect on biological matter) have all been
eliminated from the Bill, leading to uncertainty about how they will be regulated.
• Post of a ‘member secretary’ in the NBA, can create two power centres– the other being the existing position of the
chairman of the NBA.
Way Forward
There is a need to bring back the focus on protecting the interests of the local communities and sharing the profits with
them. The main focus of the legislation should be to protect India’s rich biodiversity and associated knowledge and protect
biological diversity and local growers through a three-tier structure of Central and State boards and local committees.
5.2. WILD LIFE (PROTECTION) AMENDMENT BILL, 2021
Why in News?
A bill to amend the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 was recently introduced in Lok Sabha.
About Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 (WPA)
• The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds and plants with a view to ensuring the ecological and
environmental security of the country.
• It empowers the State to declare protected areas, under four categories- National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries,
Community Reserves and Conservation Reserves.
• Important bodies established under the act include-
o National Board for Wildlife
o National Tiger Conservation Authority
o Central Zoo Authority
• The act has created 6 schedules for specially protected plants (one), specially protected animals (four), and vermin
species (one), which gave varying degrees of protection to classes of flora and fauna.
Rationale behind amendments:
• Rationalise Schedules for the purposes of clarity: Present classification of schedules cause confusion and is
unnecessary, as WPA essentially has only two levels of protection for animals in 4 of its schedules-
o Species listed in Schedule I and Part II of Schedule II which are accorded higher level of protection.
o Species listed in Part I of Schedule II, Schedule III, and Schedule IV which are comparatively accorded lower level
of protection.
• Proper implementation of the provisions of the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora), which India is a party to.
• Enable control of invasive alien species.
Case in Point: Ayush companies seeking relaxation of
the benefit-sharing provisions
• The Uttarakhand Biodiversity Board (UBB) sent a
notice to Divya Pharmacy in 2016 stating that the
company was in violation of the Biodiversity Act
for using biological resources from the state for
its ayurvedic formulations, without intimating the
board and that it was liable to pay an access and
benefit-sharing fee.
• Challenging the board’s notice, the company filed
a writ petition before the Uttarakhand high court
in December 2016 challenging the powers of the
biodiversity board to determine benefit-sharing
by Indian companies.
• The court in 2018 upheld the powers of the
biodiversity board in its judgement.
55 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Add provisions for better management
of protected areas, better care of seized
live animals and disposal of seized wild
life parts and product.
• Empower the Central Government for
improved implementation of the Act.
Proposed Amendments in the Wild Life
(Protection) Amendment Bill, 2021
• Rationalisation of the Schedules: The Bill
reduces the total number of schedules
from 6 to 4 by:
o reducing the number of schedules for
specially protected animals to two (one for greater protection level),
o removing the schedule for vermin species, and
o inserting a new schedule for specimens listed in the Appendices under CITES (scheduled specimens).
• Wild animals to be declared as Vermin by the way of notification by the Central Government for any area and for a
specified period.
• Controlling Invasive alien species: Empowers the central government to regulate or prohibit the import, trade,
possession or proliferation of invasive alien species. An officer can be authorised to seize and dispose the invasive
species.
o Invasive alien species refers to plant or animal species which are not native to India and whose introduction may
adversely impact wild life or its habitat.
• New Chapter VB for implementation of CITES: with following provisions-
o Designation of authorities: The Central government will designate a:
✓ Management Authority, which grants export or import permits for trade of scheduled specimens.
✓ Scientific Authority, which gives advice on aspects related to impact on the survival of the specimens being
traded.
o Identification mark: As per CITES, the Management Authority may use an identification mark for a
specimen. Modification or removal of the identification mark is prohibited.
o Registration certificate: Person possessing live specimens of scheduled animals must obtain a registration
certificate from the Management Authority.
• Control of sanctuaries: Chief Wild Life Warden shall control, manage and maintain all sanctuaries in accordance with
the management plan prepared as per guidelines issued by the Central Government.
o In the case of sanctuaries falling in Scheduled Areas or areas where the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional
Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 is applicable, in accordance with the management plan
prepared after due consultation with the concerned Gram Sabha.
• New section 42A for Surrender of captive animals: Any person to voluntarily surrender any captive animals or animal
products to the Chief Wild Life Warden.
56 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o No compensation will be paid to the person for surrendering such
items and the surrendered items become property of the state
government.
• Penalties: The Bill increases fines for violating the provisions of the
Act.
• Relaxation of certain restrictions:
o Including film-making (without making any change in the habitat
or causing any adverse impact to the habitat or wildlife) as one
of the purposes for which permits may be granted to enter or
reside in a sanctuary.
o Allow for transfer or transport of live elephants by person having ownership certificates in accordance with
conditions prescribed by the Central Government.
o Certain activities such as, grazing or movement of livestock, bona fide use of drinking and household water by
local communities, etc., shall be considered as non-prohibitive under section 29 i.e. allowed without a permit in
a sanctuary.
• Other changes:
o The Preamble to the Act amended to include the aspects of ‘conservation’ and ‘management’ of wild life.
o Allow the Central Government to declare conservation reserves in areas leased or otherwise transferred to it by
the State Government.
o State Board for Wild Life permitted to constitute a Standing Committee.
o Enable the Central Government to call for information and issue directions for proper implementation of the
Act.
o No renewal of any arms licences shall be granted to any person residing within ten kilometres of a sanctuary
except under the intimation to the Chief Wild Life Warden or the authorised officer
Conclusion
The amendments to the WPA, 1972 were long overdue and needed for efficient implementation of the CITES.
5.3. DEVELOPMENT INDUCED DISPLACEMENT
Why in news?
The Polavaram irrigation project will displace the highest number of people in India’s history of such projects i.e., about
1 lakh families in Andhra Pradesh, upon completion.
More about news
• Polavaram irrigation project is to be build on Godavari River.
• The areas which are already submerged and will be submerged by next year due to the project are scheduled areas,
with predominant tribal population.
About Development Induced Displacement (DID)
• It is characterized by the permanent relocation of all households within a geographic area as a result of the
construction of infrastructure projects.
• Categories: DID may be divided into two categories (direct and indirect):
o Direct displacement refers to those cases, where due to the initiation and construction of developmental
projects there is a direct displacement of people.
o Indirect displacement occurs when the people are forced to leave the area due to the functioning of those
developmental projects. This is because the functioning of the projects consumes the natural and environmental
resources in the surrounding and deprives their traditional means of livelihood.
• Global Status:
o Direct displacement: Assessments sponsored by the World Bank have estimated that every year since 1990,
roughly 10 million people worldwide have been displaced involuntarily by infrastructural development projects.
Dams for irrigation and hydropower are a major cause of such forced displacement.
57 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o Indirect displacement: According
to World Bank though large dams
constitute only 26.6 per cent of the
total WB funded projects causing
displacement, the resulting
displacement makes up 62.8 per
cent of the total number of people
displaced.
• India’s status:
o In India around 50 million people
have been displaced due to
development projects in over 50
years.
o The tribals who comprise 8.08% of
India’s population are estimated to
be more than 40% of the displaced
population. Dalits constitute 20%
of displaced persons (DPs).
o Study of 54 large dams done by
the Indian Institute of Public
Administration concluded that
the average number of people
displaced by a large dam is
44,182.
Risks associated with Development-Induced Displacement
• Landlessness: Expropriation of land removes the main foundation upon which people’s productive systems and
commercial activities are constructed. This is the principal form of de-capitalization and pauperization of displaced
people, as they lose both natural and human-made capital.
• Joblessness: The risk of losing wage employment is very high both in urban and rural displacements for those
employed in enterprises, services, or agriculture. Unemployment or underemployment among resettlers often
endures long after physical relocation has been completed.
• Homelessness: Loss of shelter tends to be only temporary for many resettlers. But for some, homelessness or a
worsening in their housing standards remains a lingering condition.
• Marginalization: Marginalization occurs when families lose economic power and spiral on a “downward mobility”
path. Economic marginalization is often accompanied by social and psychological marginalization, expressed in a
drop in social status, a feeling of injustice, and deepened vulnerability.
• Food Insecurity: Forced uprooting increases the risk that people will fall into temporary or chronic
undernourishment, defined as calorie-protein intake levels below the minimum necessary for normal growth and
work.
• Increased Morbidity and Mortality: Massive population displacement threatens to cause serious decline in health
levels. Displacement-induced social stress and psychological trauma are sometimes accompanied by the outbreak of
relocation related illnesses, particularly parasitic and vector-borne diseases.
o Unsafe water supply and improvised sewage systems increase vulnerability to epidemics and chronic diarrhea,
dysentery, and so on. The weakest segments of the demographic spectrum: infants, children, and the elderly are
affected most strongly.
• Social disintegration: Life-sustaining informal social networks that provide mutual help are rendered non-functional.
Trade linkages between producers and their customer base are interrupted, and local labor markets are disrupted.
• Violation of Human Rights: Displacement from one’s habitual residence and the loss of property without fair
compensation can, in itself, constitute a violation of human rights. The risk of communal violence also increases
when new settlers move in amongst existing populations.
58 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o Arbitrary displacement can also lead to violations of civil and political rights, including: arbitrary arrest, degrading
treatment or punishment, temporary or permanent disenfranchisement and the loss of one’s political voice.
Efforts towards Rehabilitation and associated issues
National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy (2007)
• It replaced the National Policy on Resettlement and
Rehabilitation for Project Affected Families, 2003.
• It aims at striking a balance between the need for land
for developmental activities and, at the same time,
protecting the interests of the land owners, and others.
• Objectives:
o To minimise displacement and to promote, as far as
possible, non-displacing or least-displacing
alternatives;
o To ensure adequate rehabilitation package and
expeditious implementation of the rehabilitation
process with the active participation of the affected
families;
o To ensure that special care is taken for protecting
the rights of the weaker sections of society.
Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013
• The Act provides for rehabilitation & resettlement and
combines it with land acquisition so that the former
does not get neglected. The ‘public purpose’ for which
land can be acquired by the government is defined.
• As per the above legislation, a comprehensive rehabilitation and resettlement package is provided for those who lost their
livelihood support which includes the landless and tenants.
• The Act also provides for schools and playgrounds, health centers, roads and electric connections and assured sources of
safe drinking water for each family. The role of the gram sabha has been clearly stressed and the government has to consult
them.
Road Ahead
• Developing an action plan: Government should adopt their National Action Plans on Human Rights that include
provisions for prevention and protection against arbitrary displacement due to development. It should include, inter
alia:
o Identification of the problems of displaced people, the measures required for helping the displaced people to
settle in the new area,
o Measures to be adopted for reducing conflicts between communities by convening consultations between
internally displaced persons and populations residing in areas of resettlement,
o Considering the needs of the resident as well as relocated populations in program design and taking steps to
prevent stigmatization or resentment.
• Equal treatment to women in the eligibility for R & R benefits: In the eligibility for R & R benefits, the women should
be treated at par with their male counterparts. The major daughter and major son should receive equal treatment.
Similarly, the R & R policy should recognize the households headed by women and they should be treated equally
for R & R benefits.
• Disseminate information about the rights of displaced persons during displacement to displaced persons and to
relevant authorities. The authorities should mandatorily disclose to the public regarding various measures adopted
for ensuring the rights of displaced people.
• Other measures:
o Any developmental projects which involve displacement should be initiated only after properly rehabilitating
each and every one affected.
o Establish monitoring and reporting systems that document violations of the rights guaranteed.
o Principles of Sustainable Development, Polluter Pays Principle and Precautionary Principle should be applied
while implementing the developmental projects.
59 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
The developmental projects are very essential for achieving economic growth of the country as well as for providing and
enhancing basic amenities of people. Therefore, the adverse impacts of developmental projects on the displaced people
must be avoided so that these projects are beneficial to everyone.
5.4. DAM SAFETY ACT, 2019
Why in News?
Recently, Rajya Sabha passed the Dam Safety Bill,
2019.
More on News
• Act proposes to help all states and UTs adopt
uniform dam safety procedures and seeks to
set up an institutional mechanism to ensure
the safe functioning of specific dams in the
country.
• It provides for adequate surveillance,
inspection, operation, and maintenance of all
the large dams in the country so as to prevent
dam failure related disasters.
• It was earlier passed by Lok Sabha in 2019.
Background
• Beginning with the failure of the Tigra dam (Madhya Pradesh) in 1917, about 40 large dams are reported to have
failed so far.
o The worst dam disaster was the failure of Machu dam (Gujarat) in 1979.
o The most recent case of failure of the Annamayya dam (Andhra Pradesh) in November 2021 is reported to have
led to the death of 20 people.
• Central Dam Safety Organisation, under the Central Water Commission (CWC), provides technical assistance to the
Dam Owners, and maintains data on Dams.
• National Committee on Dam Safety, devises Dam Safety Policies and Regulations.
• Dam safety by CWC
o Dam Safety assurance and Rehabilitation Project (World Bank assisted) was implemented in four States –
namely Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.
o Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) to improve safety of selected dams, install basic dam safety
related facilities etc.
• Other steps taken for dam safety in India
o DHARMA (Dam Health and Rehabilitation Monitoring) software for effective collection and management of
asset and health data for all large dams in India.
o Seismic hazard analysis information system (SHAISYS) to estimate seismic hazard at a point in South Indian
Region.
• In 2007, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal had passed resolutions, requesting Parliament to make a law on dam
safety.
• Consequently, the Dam Safety Bill, 2010 was introduced in Lok Sabha under Article 252, which allows Parliament to
make laws on state subjects, applicable to those states, that pass a resolution requesting such a law.
About Dams
• Dams are artificial barriers on rivers which store water and help in
irrigation, power generation, flood moderation, and water supply.
• As on June 2019, India has 5,745 large dams (includes dams under
construction).
o After China and USA, India is the 3rd largest dam-owning
nation in the world.
o Most of the dams in India are constructed and maintained by
the states, while some of the bigger dams are managed by
autonomous bodies such as Damodar Valley Corporation or
Bhakra Beas Management Board of Bhakra-Nangal Project.
• Over 75% of these dams are more than 20 years old and about 220
dams are more than 100 years old.
• Most of these large dams are in Maharashtra (2394), Madhya
Pradesh (906), and Gujarat (632).
60 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
Key features of the Act
Applicability • Act applies to all specified dams in the country. These are dams with:
o Height more than 15 metres, or
o Height between 10 metres to 15 metres and satisfying certain additional design conditions such as
reservoir capacity.
Dam safety
authorities
• There will be four layers of monitoring, two at the central level and two at the state level.
o A National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS) will be constituted to help evolve uniform dam safety
policies, protocols, and procedures.
o A National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) as a regulatory body for ensuring the nationwide implementation
of dam safety policies and standards.
✓ Any decision taken by NDSA shall be binding upon all the parties.
o At the State level, the Bill prescribes for the constitution of State Committees on Dam Safety (SCDS) and
the establishment of the State Dam Safety Organizations (SDSO).
✓ SDSO will undertake surveillance, inspections and monitoring of operation and maintenance of all
specified dams.
✓ Every SDSO is required to report the event of any dam failure under their jurisdiction to the NDSA.
Obligation
of Dam
Owners
• Dam owners will be responsible for the safe construction, operation, maintenance and supervision of a dam.
They must provide a dam safety unit in each dam.
• Functions of Dam owners include preparing an emergency action plan, carrying out risk assessment studies
and preparing a comprehensive dam safety evaluation.
Offences
and
penalties
• Anyone obstructing a person in the discharge of his functions under the Bill or refusing to comply with
directions may be imprisoned for a year.
• In case of loss of life, the person may be imprisoned for two years.
Others • It also addresses in a comprehensive manner, critical concerns related to dam safety on account of emerging
climate change related challenges.
• This Bill provides for regular inspection and hazard classification of dams.
61 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
Need for the Act
• Safety concern: An unsafe dam constitutes a hazard to human life, flora and fauna, ecology and public and private
assets. Further, it is very important for
safeguarding the huge investment in
critical physical infrastructure.
o In the absence of a proper dam safety
institutional framework, shortcomings
of varying degrees may get ingrained in
the investigation, design, construction,
operation and maintenance of dams.
• Fulfilling dual role: Of harnessing the river
water for accelerating socio-economic
growth and, Mitigating the miseries of a
large population, suffering from the
vagaries of floods and droughts.
• Fulfilling basic human needs: such as
Water for Drinking and Industrial use,
irrigation for agricultural operations, flood
control, hydro power generation, inland
navigation etc.
• National water security: It is also
important in the emerging scenarios of
India’s water crisis, linked with its growing
population as well as climate change.
• Addressing inter-state conflicts: According
to the Act, if the dams of one State fall
under the territories of another, then NDSA
will perform the role of SDSO, thus eliminating potential causes for inter-State conflicts.
• Uniform mechanism: Act provides for an institutional mechanism at both Central and State levels to address
structural and non-structural measures required for ensuring the safe functioning of dams.
• Enforcing safety protocols: There are many protocols, including pre and post-monsoon inspections, for ensuring dam
safety. However, as of now these protocols are not legally mandated, and the agencies concerned have no powers to
enforce them.
Conclusion
Safety of dam is a matter of great concern to the nation. An unsafe dam constitutes a hazard to human life, flora and
fauna, ecology and public and private assets.
Therefore, it is necessary to enact a law to provide for proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of
dams of certain parameters in India to ensure their safe functioning.
However, given the sentiments expressed by a number of states, the Centre can hold talks with the States to allay their
fears and frame rules suitably for legislation.
5.5. PROTECTION OF PLANT VARIETIES AND FARMERS’ RIGHTS ACT
Why in news?
Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Authority (PPV&FRA) under the PPV&FR Act has revoked a plant variety
protection certificate granted to PepsiCo India Holding on FC-5 potato variety (also called as FL-2027) on multiple grounds.
62 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
About the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPV&FR) Act
• The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights (PPV&FR) Act, was enacted in 2001 under Article 27(3) (b) of
the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
o The act is in conformity with International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV), 1978 (an
intergovernmental organization, to provide and promote an effective system of plant variety protection, with the
aim of encouraging the development of new varieties of plants, for the benefit of society).
• The Act introduced intellectual property protection in Indian agriculture and is the world’s only IPR legislation
which grants intellectual property rights not only to the plant breeders but also to the farmers.
• Objectives of the Act
o To recognize and protect the rights of farmers in respect of their contributions in conserving, improving and
making available plant genetic resources for the development of new plant varieties.
63 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o To accelerate agricultural development in the country, protect plant breeders’ rights; stimulate investment for
research and development both in public & private sector for the development new of plant varieties.
o Facilitate the growth of seed industry in the country, to ensure the availability of high quality seeds and planting
material to the farmers.
• Institutional Mechanism:
o Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Authority (PPV&FR Authority): To implement the provisions of
the Act by Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture. General Functions of the Authority
include:
✓ Registration of new plant varieties
✓ Developing DUS (Distinctiveness, Uniformity and Stability) test guidelines for new plant species,
✓ Facilitate development and commercialisation of new varieties through formal linkages with agricultural
universities, research institutions and Krishi Vigyan Kendras,
✓ Recognizing and rewarding farmers, community of farmers, particularly tribal and rural community engaged
in conservation and improvement;
✓ Maintenance of National Gene Bank to store the seed material
✓ Preservation of plant genetic resources of economic plants and their wild relatives
o Plant Varieties Protection Appellate Tribunal (PVPAT): The decisions of the PVPAT can be challenged in High
Court. The Tribunal shall dispose of the appeal within one year.
• Eligibility criteria: A variety of seed is eligible for registration under the Act if it fulfill the criteria of Distinctiveness,
Uniformity and Stability (DUS). The protection period is for 15 years for trees and 18 years in the case of vines.
o The Act prescribes the registrable plant varieties that can be registered for protection, namely:
✓ New varieties
✓ Extant variety
✓ Farmers' variety
✓ Essentially derived variety
• Rights under the Act:
Breeders’
Rights
• Breeders will have exclusive rights to produce, sell, market, distribute, import or export the protected/
registered variety.
• Breeder can appoint agent/ licensee and may exercise for civil remedy in case of infringement of rights.
Researchers’
Rights
• Researcher can use any of the registered variety under the Act for conducting experiment or research.
• This includes the use of a variety as an initial source of variety for the purpose of developing another variety
but repeated use needs prior permission of the registered breeder.
Farmers’
Rights
• A farmer who has evolved or developed a new variety is entitled for registration and protection in like manner
as a breeder of a variety.
• Section 39(1) of the Act allows all farmers cultivating a registered new variety the right to "save, use, sow,
resow, exchange, share or sell farm produce including seeds" except the branded seeds.
• Section 39 (2) of the Act provides for compensation to the farmers for non-performance of variety.
• Farmer shall not be liable to pay any fee in any proceeding before the Authority or Registrar or the Tribunal or
the High Court under the Act. It will be paid through National Gene Fund.
Implications of the current verdict
• Setting a precedent: This was the first case of infringement of rights under the Act. It upholds farmers' seed
freedoms and sends an important signal that farmers' rights cannot be taken lightly by IPR-holders in the country.
• Highlighted the loopholes in the present act and its implementation such as:
o Enforcement issues: As agriculture is a state subject, enforcement is left to States. However there exists a large
variance in laws across states. Unique protections provided to farmers can act as an enforcement loophole given
the grey area between farmers and aggregators.
✓ For instance, when any aggregator (who owns an acre of land and is also considered as a farmer) collects the
seed from farmer and then sells it in a branded fashion, it may lead to pilferage of the parent seed. Rampant
spread of unauthorised and genetically modified HTBt cotton seeds is an example of this.
64 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o Lack of IPR protection may hinder innovation: The PPVFR requires companies to submit parent seeds when
applying for registration. This has already deterred many domestic and foreign players from introducing the latest
varieties.
✓ Currently, less than 3% of annual revenue of seed market is ploughed back into research, in contrast with 10-
12% which is the global standard.
o Complicated and slow process for registration of new varieties.
o Procedural gaps exist in the process of registration.
Way ahead
• Widespread variance in State-level laws and regulations need to be addressed.
• Need to ensure that the farmer has a stake in innovation by ensuring better realisations for adopting innovative
varieties.
• For this, there is a need for more investment in farm infrastructure, including processing and pre-processing plants,
as well as identity protected supply chains.

o The project has reached out to 5500 SafaiSathis, in
an effort to institutionalize workers from the
informal sector.
o “Utthaan”, a social protection programme was
launched to help 9000 safaisathsi.
o However, the programme suffered a setback after
the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread
increase in waste, including medical plastic waste.
• The UNDP is also working with NITI Aayog and have
jointly developed a ‘handbook’ model for local
municipalities as well as the private sector.
o The handbook provides a comprehensive
overview of PWM by representing and discussing
components of the entire plastic waste value
chain.
5.6.7. BOESENBERGIA ALBOLUTEA &
BOESENBERGIA RUBROLUTEA
• These two species of plants are now Extinct in the Wild
(EW) under IUCN which were discovered around 125
years ago.
• Boesenbergiarubrolutea was endemic to Khasi Hill-
Meghalaya while Boesenbergiaalbolutea was endemic
to Andaman Island.
o Classified under the genus Boesenbergia, the
species belong to the family Zingiberaceae, the
ginger family of flowering plants.
• Possible reasons for their disappearance include
climate change, human interference and over-
exploitation, or natural calamities.
5.6.8. CANARY BLACK BEE
• About 50 days after Cumbre Vieja volcano in the
Canary Islands erupted, tens of thousands of bees were
found alive inside hives that had been covered in
volcanic ash.
66 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Honeybees use propolis (a resin like mixture
sometimes known as bee glue), produced from
substances they collect from plants and buds, to plug
tiny gaps in hive from gases of the volcano.
• Generally, propolis is used by honey bees to protect it
from rainwater and drafts.
5.6.9. MINISTRY OF COAL HAS SET UP
MISSION COKING COAL (MCC)
• MCC is based on the recommendations of Inter-
Ministerial Committee set up to strategise
augmentation of coking coal production in India.
o Coking refers to the coal's ability to be converted
into coke, a pure form of carbon that can be used
in basic oxygen furnaces.
o Coking coal is used in manufacturing of steel
through blast furnace route.
✓ Domestic coking coal is high ash coal
(between 18% - 49%) and is not suitable for
direct use in blast furnance. Therefore, it is
blended with imported coking coal (<9% ash).
• Objective of MCC
o To prepare an action plan to increase production
and utilisation of domestic coking coal.
o Adoption of new technologies.
o Allocation of coking coal blocks for private sector
development.
o Setting up of new coking coal washeries, enhanced
R&D activities and improvement of quality
parameters.
• It helps to boost production and strengthen in-house
capabilities which thereby will reduce imports and
lead to AtmaNirbhar Bharat.
o About 50 MT coking coal is imported by the
country on an annual basis and the value of coking
coal imported in FY 2020-21 was Rs.45435 crore.
5.6.10. GOVERNMENT ISSUES ADVISORY
TO CARMAKERS TO INTRODUCE FLEX-
FUEL ENGINES IN VEHICLES
• Car makers have been given six months to introduce
flex fuels so that cars can also run on ethanol in the
future.
• Flex Fuel Vehicle is a modified version of vehicles that
could run both on gasoline and blended petrol with
different levels of ethanol blends.
o These are currently being used successfully in
Brazil, giving people the option to switch fuel
(gasoline and ethanol).
o Flex-fuel, or flexible fuel, is an alternative fuel
made of a combination of gasoline and methanol
or ethanol.
• Advantage of FFV
o Provides option for using bio-fuels, which are
better than petrol (are import substitute, cost
effective, pollution-free and indigenous).
✓ Target date for achieving 20% ethanol-
blending with petrol has been advanced by
five years to 2025.
o Help in addressing the problems of surplus food
grains (can be used in making ethanol).
o Reduce dependence on oil imports.
• Challenges:
o Require additional investment from auto
companies in production lines and technology
transfers.
o Ethanol can also cause corrosion and damage to
the engine.
o Ethanol is also not as economical as gasoline as it
does not provide the same level of fuel efficiency.
5.6.11. AGRICULTURAL PHOTOVOLTAIC
(AGRI-PV)
• Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL) has developed
large-scale agri-voltaic farming.
• Agri-voltaic farming- is a mixed system of solar energy
production associating solar panels and crop at the
same time on the same land area.
• It is an evolving practice in sustainable development
that combines the production of food and energy.
• PV-module are installed in Agri voltaic system
(AVS)inclination angle equal to the latitude of the place
of installation.
• Agri-PV overcomes the present either-or situation by
achieving both power generation and agricultural
yield.
5.6.12. INDIA-EU CLEAN ENERGY AND
CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP
• During India-EU Energy Panel meet, both sides have
agreed to step up their Clean Energy and Climate
Partnership.
o They jointly agreed on a detailed work programme
until 2023 to implement the 2016 India-EU Clean
Energy and Climate Partnership.
• The Energy Panel agreed on increased technical
cooperation in energy efficiency, renewable energy,
green hydrogen, grid integration, sustainable
financing etc.
• As part of this strengthened cooperation, the EU and
India will undertake new studies, study visits and joint
workshops, exchanging knowledge and best practices
on these areas.

Positive Energy Buildings (NPEB) were launched
• NZEB are highly efficient buildings with extremely low
energy demand.
• Based on Energy Performance Index (EPI), i.e. total
energy consumed in a building over a year divided by
total built up area, the buildings having
o 10 ≤ EPI ≤ 0 kWh/m2/year, will be awarded by
Shunya Label.
o EPI < 0 kWh/m2/year will be awarded by Shunya+
label.
• It will encourage to make energy efficient buildings
and further making improvements to make it

6. SOCIAL ISSUES
6.1. MARRIAGE AGE OF WOMEN
Why in news?
Recently, the Prohibition of Child
Marriage or PCMA (Amendment) Bill,
2021, that proposes to raise the legal
age of marriage for women from 18 to
21 years — the same as men, was
introduced in the Lok Sabha.
More on news
• The bill is based on
recommendations submitted to
NITI Aayog in December 2020 by
the Centre’s task force, headed
by Jaya Jaitly. It was constituted
to examine matters pertaining to
o age of motherhood,
o imperatives of lowering MMR
(Maternal Mortality Rate),
o improvement of nutritional
levels and related issues.
• Key highlights of the draft Bill
o The draft bill would amend the PCMA, 2006.
o Aim: To bring women on a par with men in terms of marriageable age, overriding all existing laws, including any
custom, usage or practice governing the parties pertaining to marriage.
o Laws that will be superseded:
✓ The Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872,
✓ The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936,
✓ The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937,
✓ The Special Marriage Act, 1954,
✓ The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and
✓ The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969,
o Definition of child: “Child” means a male or female who has not completed 21 years of age’.
o The amendment has been proposed to fulfill the spirits of the Constitution by as it would ensure and gender
neutrality when it comes to marriage and also facilitate women empowerment.
Positive aspects of raising the marriage age
• Gender-neutrality: With this decision, the government will be bringing the age of marriage for both men and women
at par.
• Women empowerment
o Education: Several girls are forced to drop their studies for marriage, and increasing the minimum legal age
required to marry to 21 would give them time to pursue their studies and offer an opportunity to pursue higher
education.
o Health
✓ Physical health: Early marriage denies girls the right to the highest attainable standard of general and
reproductive health. An early age of marriage, and consequent early pregnancies, have adverse impacts on
nutritional levels of mothers and their children. It also has an impact on IMR and MMR.
69 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
✓ Psychological health: Teenage brides may not be mature enough to deal with household responsibilities. This
may reflect badly on the mental health of such women.
o Economic participation: Marriage at a young age means not even a quarter of women in India get into the labor
force despite accounting for almost half of the 1.3 billion population.
o Reducing child marriage: The recently released National Family Health Survey (NFHS) revealed that child marriage
has come down marginally from 27% in 2015-16 to 23% in 2019-20 in the country. The government has been
pushing to bring this down further. Raising the age of marriage can aid in enhanced awareness about the
repercussion of child marriages and reducing the same further.
Criticism of raising the age of marriage
• Rise in average age of marriage: According to government data from 2019, the average age to marry for women is
22.1 years. This figure has gradually risen over the years, which shows that the change is voluntary. The change has
taken place largely as the education rate among women has improved.
• Rising education yet falling economic participation of women: The rise in enrolment in higher education and
particularly that of women has been a feature over the last two decades. The age of marriage for women at 18,
therefore, has not been a debilitating factor. However, this rise in educated women has not resulted in rise in female
labour force participation.
o Therefore, the proposed legislation may not address the social and cultural patriarchal norms that hinder
women empowerment.
• Not a solution for child marriage: Even with the legal age of marriage for women being kept at 18 years, child
marriages continue in India and a decrease in such marriages has not been because of the existing law but because
of increase in girl’s education and employment opportunities.
o It is therefore argued that instead of legally increasing the minimum marital age, the root cause of child
marriage, like poverty & lack of education, should be addressed in order to bring about a value change in society.
• Safest age for pregnancy: Mortality experienced by the cohort aged 20 years to 24 years (roughly those marrying at
ages 18 years and higher) is by far the lowest of all age groups.
• Abuse of law: The law would end up being coercive, and in particular negatively impact marginalised communities,
such as the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes, making them law-breakers.
o Also, the amendment could push a large portion of the population into illegal marriages.
• Contradicts with other laws: A person upon reaching the age of 18 could vote but could not exercise the right of
choice to marry.
o Furthermore, as per the 2013 Criminal Law Amendment Act, age of consent for sexual activity is 18 years. Now,
there are anticipation among social activists that the age of consent would be further raised to 21 to bring it on a
par with the revised age of marriage of women.
o Similarly, the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2016 allows adolescent in the age
group of 14-18 years to work except in hazardous occupations and processes. But, the proposed legislation
prohibits married below 21 years of the age.
• Other way of ensuring gender neutrality: In 2018, the Law Commission of India had suggested decreasing the
minimum legal age of men from 21 to 18 years, and recommended keeping both the genders’ minimum legal age to
marry as 18 years.
Way ahead: Following deliveries must come first, as, unless they are implemented and women are empowered, the law
will not be as effective.
• Information, education and communication (IEC): Comprehensive public awareness campaign be chalked out to
encourage social acceptance of the decision. Also, sensitizing young students of both gender about the importance
of individual financial stability and the dangers of teenage pregnancies is needed.
• Empowerment of women: Access to schools and universities for girls, including transportation in the case of
educational institutes in far-flung areas. Training of women in polytechnic institutes, skills and business training and
livelihood enhancement. Sex education be formalised and introduced in the school curriculum.
• Targeted approach for reducing Child marriage: Girls belonging to socio-economically weak families are forced into
child marriages and providing them financial support, especially for pursuing education, will automatically raise the
age of marriage among women.

6.2. BETI BACHAO, BETI PADHAO SCHEME
Why in news?
Recently, the committee report titled "Empowerment of Women through Education with Special Reference to Beti
Bachao-Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme" was tabled in Lok Sabha.
Achievements of BBBP so far
During the last 6 years since its inception, the progress in terms of monitorable targets as per Health Management
Information System (HMIS) of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are as follows-
Parameter Details Status
Sex Ratio at
Birth (SRB)
• In 2021, SRB has improved by 19 points from 918 to 937.
• Some districts which have shown huge improvement are Mau (Uttar Pradesh), Karnal, and
Mahendergarh, Rewari (Haryana), Patiala (Punjab).
Improved
Health • Percentage of institutional deliveries has shown an improving trend from 87% to 94% in 2019-
20.
Improved
Education • Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of girls in the schools at secondary level and percentage of
schools with functional separate toilets for girls has improved.
Improved
About BBBP Scheme
• It was launched in 2015 at Panipat,
Haryana to address a decline in child sex
ratio and related issues of empowerment
of girls.
• It brings behavioural change in the
society towards birth and rights of a girl
child. Scheme aims to introduce mind set
change with the help of nuanced
communication with the following target
groups:
o Primary: Young and newly married
couples; Pregnant and Lactating mothers; parents
o Secondary: Youth, adolescents (girls and boys), in-laws, medical doctors/ practitioners, private hospitals, nursing
homes and diagnostic centres
o Tertiary: Officials, PRIs; frontline workers, women SHGs/Collectives, religious leaders, voluntary organizations,
media, medical associations, industry.
• It is a tri-ministerial convergent effort of Ministries of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), Health & Family
Welfare and Education.
o MoWCD is the nodal ministry.
• 2 major components of BBBP:-
o Advocacy and Media Campaign on BBBP
o Multi-Sectoral intervention in selected Districts:
• It has no provision for individual cash incentive components and thus is not a DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) scheme.
• From the financial year 2016-17, MoWCD has started the disbursement of grants-in-aid directly to the District
Collectors of selected districts for implementation of BBBP Campaign.
Issues as highlighted in report
• Inadequate use of funds sectoral interventions: Nearly 80% of the funds for the scheme has been used for its
advertising and not on sectoral interventions such as in health and education for girls.
• Poor utilisation of funds: Since its inception till 2019-20, the total budgetary allocation was Rs 848 crore. Only 25.13%
of the funds has been spent by the states/UT which reflects poor utilisation, resulting in poor performance.
71 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Improper monitoring: Irregular task force meetings and delays in collecting monthly reports or statement of
expenditure from districts, reflects the non-compliance of the guidelines highlighting that the scheme is not being
reviewed or monitored properly.
• Lack of functional toilets in schools is a major reason for dropping out of girls.
Recommendations of the report
• Planned expenditure: The government should focus on other verticals by making ample financial provisions to help
achieve measurable outcomes related to education and health envisaged under the scheme.
• Review and Monitoring: Regular audits and real-time updation of activities are necessary to ensure compliance.
• Target oriented approach: Funds should be
release to the states/UT strictly on the basis of
actual utilisation of earlier release and after
proper scrutiny of expenditure/ utilisation of
the previous funds. Nodal ministry must have a
target-oriented approach for the states and
must act in a time-bound manner.
• Infrastructure: Timeline should be finalised for
constructing 100% segregated functional toilets
for girls in government schools, and in
convergence with Jal Shakti Mission, tapped
water supply be ensured in them.
• Enhance Community Mobilisation: Private
participation, involvement of NGOs, Self Help
Group platforms can be used to sensitise girls to
the wider level by encouraging positive
discussions about the scheme.
• Emulate best practices: Best practices from best
performing states to be emulated by other
districts/States where child sex ratio is comparatively low.
6.3. EDTECH SECTOR IN INDIA
Why in News?
Recently, Ministry of Education issued
advisory to citizens regarding use of
caution against EdTech Companies.
About EdTech
• EdTech is short for “education
technology.” It uses computers,
computer programs, and educational systems to provide learning and training to students and employees.
• Indian EdTech industry was valued at US$ 750 million in 2020 and is expected to reach US$ 4 billion by 2025 at a
CAGR of 39.77%.
• There are more than 4,530 EdTech companies (September 2021) of which 435 have come about in the past two
years.
• Major EdTech startups in India: Global (Coursera, Simplilearn, Udacity, Lynda.com, Skisssoft etc), Indian (BYJU’s,
Unacademy, Toppr, UpGrad etc)
Steps taken by government to empower girl child
• Sukanya Samridhi Yojana: It is a small deposit scheme for a girl
child and launched as a part of BBBP Campaign to meet the
education and marriage expenses of a girl child.
• Vigyan Jyoti Scheme: To create a level-playing field for the
meritorious girls in high school to pursue Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in their higher education.
• Balika Samriddhi Yojana: To support girls in financially
vulnerable sections of society and ensures the enrolment and
retention of girl child in primary and secondary schools.
• Ladli Scheme: It was launched by the Haryana government to
break the stigma relating to the birth of a girl child.
Steps taken to increase Sex Ratio
• Sex selection is reduced by enforcing PCPNDT act (Pre
conception and Pre Natal-Diagnostic technique Act,1994), legal
action against quacks who are indulging in illegal abortions.
• As a part of creating awareness towards the importance of girl
child, opening of savings account with first deposit as Janani
Suraksha Yojana amount is done on the same day of delivery
with Birth Certificate as a proof.
72 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
73 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
Advantages of EdTech
• Flexible learning option: As online education is not based on time and place, and students only require a laptop or a
smartphone with an internet connection. Also, working professionals can complete courses at their own pace.
• More cost-effective: than a regular on campus degree; this helps students who cannot afford a regular college degree
to pursue/complete their degrees.
• Gamification and rise of edutainment: Companies have introduced learning through games and puzzles that make it
easier and fun for students to understand concepts.
• Imparting ‘on-the-job’ skills: Career advancement courses by EdTech companies could increase the candidate’s
chances of landing better jobs, switch jobs, get promotions, negotiate better pay packages and stay relevant in the
industry.
• Supplement the conventional model: the existing educational infrastructure is not equipped to meet the additional
requirements. E-learning can help bridge the gap to a considerable extent.
• Enable remote education: EdTech enables scale and speed using a direct to the device model, breaks down
geographical barriers and allowing students access to high-quality education. Teachers became facilitators, managing
remotely.
• Supplement government’s digital push: Several programmes such as ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’ were launched to
spread digital literacy, create a knowledge-based society, and implement three principles ‘access, equity and quality’
of the education policy.
Need for regulation
• Disruption to conventional learning due to pandemic: As schools and universities switched to digital or online models
to allow students to continue their learning, it is crucial to be mindful of the gaps in the digital experience.
• Checking Cyber Threats: To prevent cyberbullying, monitoring content for material unsuitable for minors, ensuring
protection of students from cyberattacks or phishing scams, screening of teachers/ instructors/ content creators, etc.
• Privacy concerns: Privacy policies of the EdTech companies are indecisive and ambiguous and assume that consent
and responsibility lie with the user. Most of the consumers are neither briefed nor have the legal know-how.
• Neglect of social skills: Many educational theorists, psychologists, and sociologists fear that students learning solely
online will suffer from a failure to develop social skills that come only from interacting in person with other people.
• False promises: Some EdTech companies are luring parents in the garb of offering free services and getting the
Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) mandate signed or activating the Auto-debit feature, especially targeting the vulnerable
families.
• Protecting rights of minors: Majority of the EdTech players in India focus on K-12 curriculum and competitive exams
training and most of their customers are minors. Under Indian laws, minors (i.e., individuals below the age of 18) are
not competent to enter contracts.
• Social and ethical concerns: Biased content delivery, Implicit influence on career decisions, less upskilling and
reskilling of educators, Standardisation, and moderation of content without regulatory approvals etc.
Way forward
• Strengthening digital infrastructure: Need to explore the use of low-cost digital platforms (For Ex Kerala’s
neighbourhood study centres) for dissemination of learning content to the masses.
• Socialisation: It is important to ensure adequate opportunities for social bonding and invest in the emotional well-
being of students, which is largely compromised due to the siloed nature of digital lessons.
• Data protection: There should be well-documented processes and policies on how the data is being collected, stored,
processed, analysed and used. Contact details of data privacy and legal offices of EdTech firms should be made
available to end-users.
• Raising awareness: Educational institutions and government education departments should facilitate awareness
campaigns, conduct regular auditing and performance reviews of these Edtech programmes.
Do’s and Don’ts released by Ministry of Education (MoE) for various stakeholders
• Avoid Automatic debit option for payment of subscription fee.
• Do not blindly trust the advertisements of the ed-tech companies
• Go through the child safety guidelines mentioned in the PRAGYATA guidelines by MoE before using any ed-tech platform.
74 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Do not allow purchases without parental consent. To avoid in-app purchases; OTP based payment methods may be adopted
as per RBI’s guidelines.
MoE also asked EdTEch companies to comply with the following:
• Ed-tech companies which may be considered e-commerce entities have to comply with Consumer Protection (E-Commerce)
Rules, 2020.
• Advertisements of Educational Institutions including the Ed-tech companies and Programs shall comply with ASCI’s Code for
Self-Regulation in advertising.
## 6.4. SURROGACY (REGULATION) ACT , 2021
Why in news?
The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 was passed by the parliament recently.
Key Features of Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
• Defines surrogacy: Surrogacy is a practice where a woman gives birth to a child for an intending couple with the
intention to hand over the child after the birth to the intending couple.
• New bodies created for regulation:
o Constitution of National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board: With chairman as Minister in-
charge of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Its functions include:
✓ Advising the Central Government on policy matters relating to surrogacy;
✓ to review and monitor the implementation of the Act,
✓ to lay down the code of conduct of surrogacy clinics;
✓ to set the minimum standards of physical infrastructure, laboratory and diagnostic equipment and expert
manpower to be employed by the surrogacy clinics;
✓ to oversee the performance of various bodies constituted under the Act;
✓ to supervise the functioning of State Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Boards.
o Constitution of State Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Boards in each state & UT level.
• Regulation of surrogacy:
o Prohibits commercial surrogacy, but
allows altruistic surrogacy.
o Surrogacy is permitted when it is
✓ for intending couples who suffer from
proven infertility;
✓ only for altruistic surrogacy purposes;
✓ not for producing children for sale,
prostitution or other forms of
exploitation;
✓ for any condition or disease specified
through regulations.
o Registration of surrogacy clinics has been
made compulsory.
o Central and state governments
shall appoint one or more
appropriate authorities for
evaluating and taking action
against breach of the
provisions of the Act.
• Eligibility criteria for surrogate
mother: Lady should be
o a married woman having a
child of her own and 25 to 35
years old;
Types of Surrogacy
• Altruistic surrogacy: It involves no monetary compensation to the
surrogate mother other than the medical expenses and insurance
coverage during the pregnancy.
• Commercial surrogacy: It includes surrogacy or its related
procedures undertaken for a monetary benefit or reward (in cash
or kind) exceeding the basic medical expenses and insurance
coverage.
o It was first legalised in India in 2002 after which India became
the ‘rent-on-womb’ capital of the world.
o However, due to lack of proper laws and safeguards for the
parties involved, multiple ethical legal challenges arose.
• Government has banned surrogacy for foreign nationals in 2015.
75 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o a surrogate only once in her lifetime;
o possess a certificate of medical and psychological fitness for surrogacy.
• Eligibility criteria for couples: The intending couple should have a ‘certificate of essentiality’ and a ‘certificate of
eligibility’ issued by the appropriate authority.
• Other features
o A child born out of a surrogacy procedure will be deemed to be the biological child of the intending couple.
o An abortion of the surrogate child requires the written consent of the surrogate mother and the authorisation
of the appropriate authority. This authorisation must be compliant with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy
Act, 1971.
o Offences and penalties include imprisonment up to 10 years and a fine up to 10 lakh rupees.
Significance of the law on Surrogacy
• Provides for Market Regulation: Act provides for registration of surrogacy clinics and ensures appropriate safeguards
in terms of penalties defined to prevent misuse.
• Safeguards the rights of the surrogate mother: By ensuring to the mother basic rights of proper pre and post-natal
care. Earlier, surrogates were forced to give birth in dingy shelters which adversely impacted the health of the mother
and the child.
o Also, safeguards have been adopted to ensure the right of the women on her body with provision for her to
abort and also by defining the responsibility of the surrogate parents vis-à-vis the child.
• Safeguards the rights of the child - Abandonment of child due to genetic or other disability, or changing of couple’s
social or marital status is legally not allowed.
• Promotes medical tourism in the country: India is a huge market for surrogacy as is reflected from the fact that in
2012, the size of India's surrogacy industry was $2 billion a year with more than 3,000 fertility clinics engaged in this
across the country.
• Supports Intended Parents: By helping them exercise their right to life and complete their family.
Shortcomings of the Act
• Total ban on Commercial surrogacy: A total ban on commercial surrogacy will push the industry underground and
render surrogate mothers even more vulnerable.
76 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o In B. K. Parthasarthi v. Government of A.P, it was decided that the right to decide about reproduction is
essentially a personal choice, and the state's intrusion into such a decision-making process has to be stringently
scrutinized.
• Restricting surrogacy only to heterosexual couples: The Apex Court in DEVIKA BISWAS V. UNION OF INDIA, held
that right to reproduction is an essential facet of 'Right to Life' under Article 21.
o Thus, restricting surrogacy only to heterosexual couples and within a particular age group while denying
reproductive choices to the LGBT community, single persons, and older couples is an evident violation of Article
21 and Article 14 as well.
• Issues with the Definition of ‘infertility’ restricted to failure to conceive: It does not cover all cases in which a couple
is unable to bear a child.
o For example, medical conditions where woman may conceive but is unable to carry a child throughout the period
of pregnancy.
• Issues related to the surrogate mother being a ‘close relative’: Act does not specify who will be a ‘close relative’.
Also, there is a possibility of coercion of daughters-in-law in families.
Way forward
• Taking care of Post Partum depression: Government must take into account postpartum depression and make
provisions for it, and that maternal benefits should be extended to both mothers.
• Rescinding the time-frame for IVF treatment: Government should consider rescinding the time- stipulated for IVF
treatment before allowing people to resort to surrogacy, as many women are medically unfit to have children, and
suffer from little-known and undetectable illnesses such as “Tokophobia” or the fear of childbirth.
• Overtime expanding the option of surrogacy to include commercial surrogacy: Expanding the surrogacy market with
proper safeguards overtime will help those deprived of the love of a child.
6.5. WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2022
Why in news?
World Migration Report 2022 was released
by International Organization for
Migration (IOM).
More on news
• Report analyses relevant migration
data in order to foster the
understanding of migration, its main
drivers and related phenomena, such
as climate change, human trafficking
and the impact of COVID-19.
o Since 2000, the IOM has been
producing its world migration
report every two years.
Key findings
• The 2022 report shows that regardless
of the disruption of the global mobility
due to COVID-19, internal
displacement increased significantly
because of natural disasters, conflict
and violence.
• Most of the new displacement is due
to climate related events
77 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o Earlier, the World Bank estimated that 143 million would migrate within their countries by 2050 due to climate
change related events in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America.
• The amount of international migrants has
grown steadily since 1970, currently
representing 3.6% of the whole population on
the planet.
o Work is the major reason that people
migrate internationally.
o 61% of all global migrants live either in
Europe or Asia, which respectively host 87
million and 86 million migrants.
• Migration for work has led to a concomitant
increase in the international remittances.
o Covid 19 saw only a small drop of 2.4% in
2020.
o In 2020, India, China, Mexico, the Philippines,
and Egypt were the top five remittance
receiving countries.
• Digital technology has been used to support
irregular migration, as well as to enable
migrants to avoid abusive and exploitative
migrant smugglers and human traffickers.
o Several government authorities have for
example harnessed emerging technologies
like AI in the areas of visa application lodgement e-
platforms and pre-departure checking, including the
use of biometric data.
• The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating and creating
vulnerabilities to human trafficking.
• The report showed that the international community has
not yet succeeded in implementing the Global Compact
for migration and on refugees to the extent needed.
o It also confirms that refugee assistance and global
resettlement targets are insufficient and have neither
addressed the unprecedented level of protection
needs and nor demonstrated solidarity with the
countries that host the vast majority of the world’s
refugees.

gender and ecological inequality.
Key Highlights of the report
• Released by: Paris-based World Inequality Lab
• Objective: To promote research on global inequality
dynamics
• Findings
o Wealth inequality:
✓ Income and wealth inequalities have been on
the rise nearly everywhere since the 1980s,
following a series of deregulation and
liberalization programs.
✓ Inequalities within countries are greater than
inequalities observed between countries.
✓ Share of wealth held by public actors is close
to zero or negative in rich countries, meaning
that the totality of wealth is in private hands.
About Global Compact on Refugees (GCR)
• It was endorsed by the UN General Assembly on
December 17, 2018.
• It is designed to promote responsibility-sharing among
host countries and communities to better support
refugees.
• It is a framework for more predictable and equitable
responsibility-sharing, recognizing that a sustainable
solution to refugee situations cannot be achieved
without international cooperation.
• It provides a blueprint for governments, international
organizations, and other stakeholders to ensure that
host communities get the support they need and that
refugees can lead productive lives.

o Income inequality:
✓ Middle East and North Africa (MENA) are the
most unequal regions in the world, whereas
Europe has the lowest inequality levels.
✓ India stands out as the most unequal
countries in the world, with the top 10 percent
holds 57% of the total national income while
the bottom 50 percent’s share is just 13% in
2021.
o Gender inequality: Women’s share of total
incomes from work (labor income) neared 30% in
1990 and stands at less than 35% today.
o Female labour income in India is equal to 18%
which is lower than the average in Asia.
o Ecological inequality:
✓ Wealth inequality had a strong correlation to
carbon emission and climate change goals.
✓ North America is responsible for highest
average per capita emission (27%), followed by
Europe and China.
✓ Bottom 50% of the population in India is
responsible for, on average, five times fewer
emissions than the average person in the
bottom 50% of the European Union

proportionate references to all periods of Indian
history; and highlight the role of great women
achievers.
• Key recommendations by Committee
o Mandatory standards related to text-book
content, graphics and layout, supplementary
materials and pedagogical approaches should be
developed.
o Need to have more child-friendly textbooks
through use of pictures, graphics, QR codes and
other audio-visual materials.
o Primary school textbooks should serve two
purposes: provide a strong foundation in core
areas (reading, writing etc) and provoke curiosity
among students.
o Textbooks should highlight lives of hitherto
unknown men and women from different states
and districts who have positively influenced our
national history, honour and oneness.
o Wrong portrayal of historical figures and freedom
fighters should be corrected.
o Educational methodologies adopted in the
ancient Universities like Nalanda, Vikramshila and
Takshila should be studied and suitably modified to
serve as a model reference for teachers.
o Traditional Indian knowledge systems should be
linked with modern science and contributions of
ancient India in the fields of philosophy, science,
mathematics etc. may also be included in the
textbooks.
6.6.8. SHRESTHA YOJNA

students by providing quality residential education
in reputed private schools.
6.6.9. SHAKTI CRIMINAL LAWS
(MAHARASHTRA AMENDMENT) BILL,
2020
• The Bill was cleared by Maharashtra Assembly to curb
crimes against women and children.
• Important provisions of the bill
o introduces death penalty for offences such as
causing grievous hurt by use of acid, rape, and gang
rape.
o reduces the time for completion of investigation,
trial, and disposal of appeal for offences
committed against women and children
o places the onus on social media platforms and
Internet data providing companies to share data
for the police investigation.
• The Bill is modelled on the Disha Act of Andhra
Pradesh.
6.6.10. CENTRE REVISES GUIDELINES FOR PROCUREMENT OF COARSE GRAIN
• Recently, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has revised guidelines for procurement, allocation,
distribution, and disposal of coarse grains, allowing distribution of Jowar (Rabi) and Ragi for a longer period of 6 and 7
months respectively.
o Under the earlier guidelines, states were allowed to procure coarse grains from farmers at Minimum Support Price
under Central Pool, subject to the prior approval of the Centre and Food Corporation of India and the quantity was to
be distributed within 3 months from the end of procurement period.
81 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Significance of increasing the distribution period
o This would increase procurement and
consumption of these commodities as the
states would have more time to distribute
these commodities in Target Public
Distribution System/ Other Welfare
Scheme.
o With the increase in procurement, the
number of farmers benefiting from the
purchase of these crops will also increase.
✓ The government procures coarse
grains mainly from Gujarat, Haryana,
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh.
o Consuming coarse cereals will help
combating malnutrition in children and
adolescents.
✓ Coarse grains are highly nutritious,
non-acid forming, gluten free and
have better dietary properties.
6.6.11. CONSUMER PROTECTION (JURISDICTION OF THE DISTRICT COMMISSION, THE
STATE COMMISSION AND THE NATIONAL COMMISSION) RULES, 2021
• Ministry of Consumer Affairs notified the rules under provision Consumer Protection Act (CPA), 2019.
o Decision was taken as the existing provisions related to pecuniary jurisdiction was causing rise in pendency and delay
in disposal of cases.
• CPA, 2019 aims to protect the rights of consumers by establishing authorities for timely and effective administration and
settlement of consumer’s dispute. It replaces CPA, 1986.
o CPA, 2019 provides a three-tier quasi-judicial mechanism for redressal of disputes-district, state and national
commission.
o It also stipulates the pecuniary jurisdiction of each tier of consumer commission.
Commissions Jurisdiction under existing provisions New pecuniary jurisdiction
District Up to ₹1 crore Upto 50 lakh rupees
State Between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore Between 50 lakh rupees and up to ₹2 crore
National Above ₹10 crore Above₹2 crore
• Mechanism provided under CPA, 2019 for settling consumer disputes
o Deciding complaint within three months if complaint does not require analysis or testing of commodities and
within 5 months if it requires analysis or testing.
o Option of filing complaint electronically through E-Daakhil Portal.
o Option of resolving disputes through mediation.

7. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
7.1. NATIONAL STRATEGY ON BLOCKCHAIN
Why in news?
National Strategy on Blockchain has been
formulated by the Ministry of Electronics &
Information Technology (MeitY).
Blockchain Technology Overview
• Blockchain is a distributed or
decentralised ledger technology
which was first introduced in the
design and development of
cryptocurrency, Bitcoin in 2009 by
Satoshi Nakamoto.
• Blockchain technology is an
amalgamation of various technologies
such as distributed systems, cryptography, etc.
• Blockchain is a series of blocks, where each block contains details of transactions executed over the network,
hash(address) of the previous block, timestamp etc.
• Data and transactions stored in blocks are secured against tampering using cryptographic hash algorithms and are
validated and verified through consensus (consensus protocols) across nodes of the Blockchain network.
• Blockchain platforms are being developed across the globe to offer Blockchain based digital transaction platforms
enabled with interoperability across various chains. Popular blockchain platforms include Hyperledger, Cosmos,
Polkadot, Redbelly, Ethereum etc.
Significance of the technology
• Decentralised mechanism: Blockchain technology
provides efficient distributed ledger storage
mechanism with appropriate authentication and
authorization thereby eliminating the need for a
third party to validate the transactions.
• Bringing transparency and efficiency: Any tangible
or intangible asset of value can be represented and
tracked on a Blockchain network, which brings
transparency, increases processing speed and
reduces cost.
• Fraud prevention: A system that is based on data stored in a number of places is immune to hackers. It is not that
easy to get access to it, and if so, any piece of information can be easily recovered.
• Enabling trust in the digital world: Features like transparency, efficiency, security and accountability fosters trust in
digital arena.
• Applicability in diverse domains: Blockchain can be used in both Permissioned and Permission-less models. These
models have applications in various domains such as education, governance, finance & banking, healthcare, logistics,
cyber security, media, legal, power sector, etc.
Examples of potential applications
• E-Governance: This technology can effectively be used in situations where multiple organizations or departments are
involved in a particular workflow which not only makes the underlying system more efficient but also brings trust,
transparency and accountability in the system.
o This includes Property Record Management, Digital birth, death and education certificates Management etc.
Blockchain Models
Public/Permissonless Private/Permissioned
Anyone can join, read, write
and commit
Only authorized participants
can write and commit
All are allowed to participate
in consensus and
anonymous resilient
Authorized nodes only can
participate in consensus
Truly decentralized because
of participation of unknown
actors
Partially decentralized
because of participation of
known actors
Finality of transaction could
take longer time due to
more number of participants
Finality of transactions could
be better in this model due to
less number of participants
83 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o For eg: UAE through Smart Dubai initiative, aims to become the first city fully powered by Blockchain by 2021 and
enhance everything from healthcare and education to environmental sustainability.
o Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) technology is used in Estonian government to prove the authenticity of the
electronic records.
• Banking: Blockchain can help in avoiding risk of payment losses involved in banking transactions, reduces cross-borders
transaction fees, corporate payments and remittances.
• Supply Chain: Blockchain can create a tamper proof record to check the real time information about product journey
from place of origin to destination place improving the reliability and efficiency of the supply chain system.
• Healthcare: By establishing a secure chain of network blockchain can help in handling the patient records, consent
forms, billings and public health monitoring.
• E-Courts: Data from multiple entities such as police, judiciary, legal department, etc. can be stored in a coordinated
manner using Blockchain technology.
• Other areas such as Automotive, Tourism, Insurance, Real Estate etc.
Strategies and Outcomes targeted for next 5 years: National Blockchain Framework
• Need: Reports predicts that by 2030,
Blockchain would be used as a
foundational technology for 30% of
the global customer base.
• Plan: MeitY has initiated a project on
design and development of a
National Blockchain Framework
(NBF) for creation of a shared
Blockchain infrastructure and
offering Blockchain as-a-Service
(BaaS). Initially, National Blockchain
Framework would be used for e-
governance domain transitioning to
incorporate various use cases over time.
This framework comprises following components for a multi-pronged strategy:
• Geographically distributed nodes across the country, to enable citizen services at large scale and enable cross domain
application development. This will facilitate effective utilization of the Blockchain technology in different domains
such as health, agriculture, education, finance, etc.
• R&D for Blockchain Challenges: MeitY shall initiate various research projects to focus on advanced research and
addressing various challenges and detection of vulnerabilities in Blockchain technology based solutions.
• To design and develop an indigenous Blockchain platform incorporating identified best practices and advanced
technological features.
• Integration with important National Level Services
such as online Electronic Signatures (e-Sign),
ePramaan and Digilocker.
• Awareness Creation: Organizing user awareness
workshops to sensitize the MSME/ Government
departments/ judiciary and law enforcement
agencies (LEAs), to boost the adoption, which would
lead to new innovative use cases based on
Blockchain.
• Policies & Regulations: The existing regulations and
policies would be updated as needed as the National
Blockchain Framework evolves and more experience is gained during the implementation.
• Adoption Incentives: Central and state Governments shall formulate their respective schemes and guidelines
detailing out fiscal and non-fiscal incentives in this sector to enable large scale adoption of Blockchain in the country.
Other prominent efforts in this direction
• Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Blockchain technology was
established by NIC in association with National
Informatics Centre Services Inc. (NICSI). Its objectives
include accelerating adoption & deployment of Blockchain
technology in Government.
• NITI Aayog in collaboration with Gujarat Narmada Valley
Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited (GNFC) has developed a
Blockchain based system for fertilizer subsidy.
• State Level efforts: Blockchain technology based solution for
property registration has been developed and is piloted at
Shamshabad District, Telangana State.
84 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Human Resource Development: Government has already started the Future Skills Prime program for upskilling and
reskilling in emerging technologies including Blockchain in association with NASSCOM to provide the required talent
pool in the country.
• Multi-Institutional Approach: To plan and implement the National Blockchain Framework, a multi- institutional
approach involving various stakeholders from Government, premier academic & research institutions, startups and
industry is proposed. Organisations like C-DAC, NIC and NICSI, NeGD, State Governments shall collaboratively work in
this direction.
o Further, Blockchain Advisory Council and Steering Committee shall be constituted to provide overall guidance
and for regular review and monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy respectively.

Presidio Principles: Foundational Values for a decentralised future
• Presidio Principles were released by World Economic Forum’s Global
Blockchain Council.
• The document calls on all actors, including developers, governments,
executives, international organisations, corporate boards, and others, to
uphold these tenets as they build blockchain applications – and to self-
direct their ecosystems in using these principles as a foundational vision for
how users can and should be protected.
• The Presidio Principles are grouped into four broad pillars as shown in the
figure.
• The principles are intended to serve as a steering document and are not
legally binding.
7.2. DRONE TECHNOLOGY IN AGRICULTURE
Why in News?
Recently, the Union Agriculture Minister
released the Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) for use of Drone in
Pesticide Application for Crop Protection
and for spraying Soil and Crop Nutrients.
Major Provisions of the SOPs
• It covers instructions on pre, post
and during operation, emergency
handling plan for effective and safe
operations of drones.
• The SOP covers important aspects of
Pesticide application and drones can
be used in Agricultural, Forestry,
Non-Cropped Areas, etc. These
aspects include:
○ Statutory provisions, Flying
permissions and Other Critical
parameters such as area distance restrictions, weight
classification, overcrowded areas restriction, drone
registration, safety insurance, piloting certification,
operation plan, air flight zones, weather conditions.
Potential of Drone Technology use in Agriculture
“Drone” means an unmanned aircraft system, i.e., an aircraft
that can operate autonomously or can be operated remotely
without a pilot on board (Drone Rules, 2021).
• Finding use in many fields, it holds potential to modernize the routine manual agriculture activities as well by linking
with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) etc.
○ This includes mining, infrastructure, surveillance, emergency response, transportation, geo-spatial mapping,
defence, and law enforcement etc.
Why use drones for spraying pesticides?
• Being toxic in nature (Biocides), the Conventional
pesticide use methods carry issues like:
o High Labor Cost, Lower spray uniformity and
excessive application.
o Health and environment risks on Oral,
respiratory or dermal (by skin) contact; pollution
of soil and water.
• Drones use can help address most of these issues.
86 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• It will also help in finding solutions to:
○ Addressing Increasing food demand with world population predicted to reach 9 billion by 2050;
○ React faster to pest invasions. E.g. in 2020, drones were used in fight against the attack on crops by swarms of
locusts in India.
○ Help in future needs of agriculture through micro level resource management to overcome unsuitable farming
methods. E.g. In an experiment, drones helped in reducing herbicide use by 52% in a Brazilian soybean field.
○ Help in Smart Agriculture through direct communication between drones and other agricultural equipment. It
involves processing of drone inputs to create field maps and sending it to farm equipment.
Challenges
• Unviable Commercial Operation due to small and scattered landholding. E.g. According to the Agriculture Census
(2015-16), around 86% farmers in India hold land less than 5 acres.
• Limited Flight time and range of Drones due to relatively high payloads (20-60 minutes).
• High Initial costs of drones with maintenance issues.
• Connectivity issues in rural areas for online coverage.
• Knowledge and skill issues as it needs specialized skills and knowledge from farmer to utilize drone inputs,
• Concerns over misuse of drones to infringe privacy and security (especially in border areas).
• Weather dependence with difficulties to operate in windy or rainy weather.
Way Forward
With Drone Rules, 2021 and the SOPs, the main challenge of the past, i.e. lack of national laws or rules is taken care of.
Further, a PLI scheme for drones would benefit all sectors including agriculture and achieve India’s potential to become
a global drone hub by 2030.
The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is already working on SENSAGRI, SENsor based Smart AGRIculture
through the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and partner Institutes to develop indigenous prototype for drone
based crop and soil health monitoring system using hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS) sensors.
We should further expand the scope of research to study the quality of its operations and fine-tune telecom, skill, and
other policies/initiatives to address the challenges of connectivity and skills among others.
7.3. JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST)
Why in news?
Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA’s most powerful telescope, is rocketed into orbit. More on news
• The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is NASA’s infrared flagship observatory.
• It is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).
• Mission goals are
o Search for first galaxies or luminous objects formed after Big Bang.
o Determine how galaxies evolved.
o Observe stars formation from the first stages to formation of planetary systems
o Measure physical and chemical properties of planetary systems, including our own Solar System, and investigate
potential for life in those systems.
• JWST is headed for Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2 (L2).
o Lagrange points are positions in space where objects sent there tend to stay put as gravitational forces of a two
body system (like Sun and Earth) equal the force required for a small object to move with them.
• Scientific instruments on JWST: Near Infrared Camera, Near Infrared Spectrograph, Mid Infrared Instrument and Fine
Guidance Sensors/Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph.
87 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• The JWST is being considered as the successor of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
Webb vs Herschel Space Observatory
• In 2009, the European Space Agency launched an infrared telescope named the Herschel Space Observatory.
• It also orbits the Sun similar to how Webb would. The primary difference between Webb and Herschel is the
wavelength range: Webb goes from 0.6 to 28 microns, while Herschel covers 60 to 500 microns.
• Also, Herschel’s mirror is smaller than Webb’s. It is 3.5 metres in diameter, while Webb’s primary mirror has a
diameter of 6.5 metres.
7.4. PARKER MISSION
Why in news?
NASA’s Parker Solar Probe (PSP) has now flown through the Sun’s upper atmosphere – the corona – and sampled particles and magnetic fields there.
About PSP
• Launched in 2018, the PSP is part of NASA's Living with a Star program to explore aspects of the Sun-Earth system that directly affect life and society.
• It is named after Eugene Newman Parker, a physicist who proposed concepts about how stars give off energy.
• It uses a carbon-composite shield, to withstand temperatures nearly 2,500 F (1,377 C), to protect itself from Sun’s heat.
88 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• It became the first spacecraft in history to touch the Sun.
• It uses a series of gravitational encounters with the planet Venus to gradually lower the orbit of the spacecraft until it enters the outer atmosphere, or corona, of the Sun.
Relevance of the PSP mission
• Deeper insights into sun's evolution: Touching the very stuff the Sun is made of will help scientists uncover critical information about our star, the Sun, and its influence on the solar system. This in turn, can also expand our knowledge on other stars in the universe.
• Predicting extreme weather events: The PSP promises new and valuable information to Scientists to help them forecasting solar storms. Thus, it can also help improving forecasts of major space weather events
o Solar storms are the biggest outbursts from the Sun can rattle our planet's magnetic field. In the process,
communications may be disrupted, satellites can be knocked offline, and power grids will be vulnerable to
electrical surges.
• Unravelling secrets in
Corona: In Corona some
key processes take place
that currently defy
explanation. For example
o The temperature of
the Sun at its
photosphere is
roughly 6,000
degree C but within
the corona it can
reach a staggering
million degrees or
more.
o It's also within this
region that the
outward flow of charged particles - electrons, protons and heavy ions - suddenly gets accelerated into a
supersonic wind.
Achievements
• In 2019, Parker discovered that magnetic zig-zag structures in the solar wind, called switchbacks, are plentiful close
to the Sun. But how and where they form remained a mystery. Halving the distance to the Sun since then, PSP has
now passed close enough to identify one place where they originate: the solar surface.
• In April, 2021, the PSP crossed the outer edge of the corona termed the Alfvén critical boundary, a point that marks
the end of solar atmosphere and beginning of the solar wind.
• It should eventually get to within 7 million km (4 million miles) of the photosphere in 2025.
89 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
Some other solar missions: NASA’s Heliophysics Missions, European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter, India’s Aditya-L1
mission.
• Aditya L1: It will be launched in the third quarter of next year (2022) and will provide more insights into the origin of
the universe and many other unknowns.” The spacecraft in the Aditya L1 mission will be sent 1.5 million km away
from the Earth to L1 Lagrangian ( a point between the Earth and the Sun where the gravitational pull of both the
bodies on the satellite is equal to the centripetal force needed to keep the satellite in orbit).
7.5. ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE
TECHNOLOGY (ART) REGULATION
ACT 2021
Why in news?
Recently, Parliament has passed the ART Regulation Act
2021 that provides for the safe and ethical practice of ART
services.
Key provisions of the Act
• Definition of ART: ART to include all techniques that
seek to obtain a pregnancy by handling sperm or
oocyte (immature egg cell) outside human body and
transferring gamete or embryo into the reproductive
system of a woman.
• Regulation of ART clinics and banks: Every ART clinic
and bank must be registered under the National
Registry of Banks and Clinics of India.
o National
Registry
established
will act as a
central
database with
details of all
ART clinics and
banks in the
country.
o State
governments
will appoint
registration
authorities for facilitating the registration process
✓ Registration Authority will have the chairperson, who will be an officer above the rank of Joint Secretary in
the Health Department.
o ART bank is an organisation that is set up to supply sperm or semen, oocytes, or oocyte donors to ART clinics or
their patients.
• Rights of a child born through ART: Child born through ART will be deemed to be a biological child of commissioning
couple and will be entitled to rights and privileges available to a natural child of the commissioning couple.
o A donor will not have any parental rights over the child.
• National and State Boards: These are constituted under the Act to regulate ART services.
o State Boards will coordinate enforcement of the policies and guidelines for ART as per the recommendations,
policies, and regulations of the National Board.
90 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o No court will take cognisance of offences under
the Act, except on a complaint made by the
National or State Board or any officer authorised
by the Boards.
• Stringent punishment: Act introduced stringent
punishment for those practising sex selection, sale of
human embryos or gametes, running agencies,
rackets, and organisations violating the law.
• Conditions for gamete donation and supply, offering
ART services have also been prescribed.
Concerns associated with the Act
• Violation of fundamental rights
o Article 14: It allows for a married heterosexual
couple and a woman above the age of marriage to
use ARTs and excludes single men, cohabiting
heterosexual couples and LGBTQ individuals and
couples from accessing ARTs.
✓ It goes against the spirit of the Supreme
Court’s landmark verdict in Navtej Johar vs
Union of India (2018), where states were
advised to take positive steps for equal protection for same-sex couples.
o Article 23: Lack of compensation for providing reproductive labour violative of Article 23 of the Constitution of
India which prohibits forced labour.
• Less protection to donor: It does little to protect the egg donor, as
harvesting of eggs is an invasive process which, if performed incorrectly,
can result in death.
• Imbalance between ART Act and Surrogacy Regulation Act (SRA), 2021: Both Acts do not work in tandem, as core
ART processes are left undefined in ART Act while several of these are defined in the SRA.
o Duplicity: Both laws set up multiple bodies for registration which will result in duplication and lack of regulation.
For instance, surrogacy clinic is not required to report surrogacy to National Registry while ART banks and clinics
have to report procedures to the National Registry.
o Offences: Offences under the ART Act are bailable but not under the SRA.
o Records: Records have to be maintained for 10 years under the ART Act but for 25 years under the SRA.
• Lack of clarity: Act’s prohibition on the sale, transfer, or use of gametes and embryos is poorly worded and will
confuse foreign and domestic parents relying on donated gametes.
Way forward
• Grievance cell: ART clinics and banks have to maintain a grievance cell. Clinics must instead have ethics committees.
Mandated counselling services should also be independent of the clinic.
• Definitions: Definitions of commissioning “couple”, “infertility”, “ART clinics” and “banks” need to be synchronised
between the SRA and ART Act.
• Maintain confidentiality: ART clinics and banks are required to keep information about commissioning parents or
women and donors confidential.
• Consent: Clinics shall perform any treatment or procedure with the written consent of all the parties seeking ART and
provide them insurance coverage.
7.6. ANTI-DOPING BILL
Why in News?
Recently, the government introduced a National Anti-Doping Bill, 2021 in Lok Sabha.
Types of ARTs
ART is used to treat infertility.
• In Vitro Fertilization (IVF): It is the most common form of
ART that is used by maximum patients. In this, woman’s
eggs are combined with man’s sperm in a laboratory. The
fertilised egg is then placed inside the woman’s uterus in a
procedure called embryo transfer.
o Mitochondrial Replacement therapy (MRT) with a
concept of three parent baby is a form of IVF.
• Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT): The man’s sperm
and a woman’s egg are made to combine in a lab. Then the
eggs are implanted into the fallopian tubes and the
fertilization occurs inside a woman’s body.
• Intrauterine insemination (IUI): Also known as artificial
insemination, it involves insertion of the male partner’s
(or a donor’s) sperm into a woman’s uterus at or just
before the time of ovulation by long narrow tube.
• Gestational Surrogacy: In this, the embryo is created via
IVF, using the eggs and sperm of the intended parents or
donors, and is then transferred to the surrogate. The child
is thus not biologically related to the surrogate mother,
who is often referred to as a gestational carrier.
Surrogacy: Surrogacy is an ART process,
where an intending couple commissions a
surrogate mother to carry their child.

About doping
• Doping is the consumption of certain prohibited substances by athletes to enhance performance.
o When the drug is consumed by the athlete, he gets an unfair advantage over the clean athlete, thereby banning
such drugs shall propagate level playing field and equality among the athletes.
• World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) monitors doping in all kinds of competitive sports.
o WADA was established in 1999 as an international independent agency composed and funded equally by the
sport movement and governments of the world.
o The WADA periodically updates its list of Prohibited Substances and Methods. This includes steroids, anabolic
agents, stimulants, and gene doping. Some components such as narcotics are permanently banned. Some, like
alcohol, are banned only in-competition.
o At the national level, there is the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA), an independent body under Union
Ministry of Sports.
• WADA monitors doping in sport based on the World Anti-Doping Code. The Code provides a framework for anti-
doping policies, rules, and regulations for sport organizations and public authorities.
o Any sportsperson competing in national or international events can be asked to give his/her blood and/or urine
samples at any point of time
by anti-doping agency or
sports events committee
during the event. Testing can
be conducted in-competition
and out-of-competition.
• The WADA doesn't directly
conduct tests. It gives
accreditation to laboratories
which adheres to the mandatory
International Standard for
Laboratories.
• In the latest report published by
the World Anti-Doping Agency,
152 (17% of the world total)
Anti-doping Rule Violations
(ADRVs) were reported in India
in 2019.
o India ranks third in the list
with the maximum dope
offenders coming from
bodybuilding (57).
Key features of the Bill
• Prohibition of doping: The Bill
prohibits athletes, athlete support personnel and other persons from engaging in doping in sport.
o Anti-doping rule violation by an individual athlete or athlete support personnel may result in:
✓ Disqualification of results including forfeiture of medals, points, and prizes
✓ Ineligibility to participate in a competition or event for a prescribed period
✓ Financial sanctions
✓ Consequences for team sports will be specified by regulations.
✓ Consequences for a violation will be determined by the National Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel after a
hearing.
o Exemptions: If any athlete requires a prohibited substance or method due to a medical condition, they may apply
to the National Anti-Doping Agency for a therapeutic use exemption.
92 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• National Anti-Doping Agency: Bill seeks to provide statutory framework for the functioning of the National Anti-
Doping Agency (NADA), empowering it to conduct raids besides strengthening measures to tackle drug abuse in
Indian sports.
o NADA established as societies under Societies Registration Act, will be dissolved and reconstituted. It will be
headed by a Director General appointed by the central government.
o The functions of the agency include:
✓ planning, implementing, and monitoring anti-doping
activities
✓ investigating anti-doping rule violations
✓ promoting anti-doping research
• National Board for Anti-Doping in Sports: The Bill establishes a
National Board for Anti-Doping in Sports to make
recommendations to the government on anti-doping regulation and
compliance of international commitments on anti-doping.
o The Board will oversee the activities of the Agency and issue
directions to it.
o The Board will consist of a Chairperson and two members
appointed by the central government.
• Disciplinary and Appeal Panels: The Board will constitute a
National Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel for determining
consequences of Anti-Doping Rule Violations. This Panel will
consist of a Chairperson and four Vice-Chairpersons (all legal
experts), and ten members (medical practitioners and retired
eminent athletes).
• Dope Testing Laboratories: The existing National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) will be deemed to be the principal
dope testing laboratory. The Union Government may establish more National Dope Testing Laboratories.
o Recently, NDTL has regained the WADA accreditation which was suspended on 20 August 2019, based on non-
compliances which were observed during on-site assessment of the Laboratory held in September 2018.
Significance of the Bill
• Strengthen doping control programme: It helps to strengthen the framework and mechanisms for carrying out the
doping control programme in sports to ensure dope-free sport in India.
o Currently, NADA had no authority to conduct raids and its anti-doping appeal panel has held the same.
• Technological and Medical Expertise: It also provides for the establishment of the NDTL and other dope testing
laboratories. Such laboratories will strengthen the capability for testing a greater number of samples considering the
sizable population and growing number of sportspersons in the country. These will also facilitate India to host mega
sports events in the country.
• Legal Backing: If passed by the Parliament, it will give legislative backing to anti-doping norms in the country.
• Adherence to international norms: It will also give effect to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation (UNESCO) International Convention against Doping in Sport.
o The Convention aims to promote the prevention of, and the fight against, doping in sport for its elimination.
o India signed the convention in 2005 and ratified it in November 2007.
Conclusion
National Anti-Doping Bill 2021 is another step in India’s quest to become a sporting powerhouse. Along with this,
measures have to be taken to ensure the safety and long-term health of the sportspersons as well as participate in the
sports ethically. Goodwill ambassadors, clean sporting icons and media can help reach the aspiring athletes and propagate
healthy participation into the sports hence, achieving athletes' full potential.
National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL)
• NDTL has regained the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA) accreditation.
o The restoration of accreditation is a
boost to India’s efforts to achieve the
highest global standards of excellence
in sport.
• NDTL was established with an aim to get
permanently accredited by International
Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA to do
the testing for the banned drugs in human
sports.
• WADA is an international independent
agency composed and funded equally by
the sport movement and governments of
the world.
o Its key activities include scientific
research, education, development of
anti-doping capacities.

## 7.7. WORLD MALARIA REPORT 2021
Why in news?
Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has released the World Malaria Report 2021 edition that assess the actions taken by states in response to Malaria in the backdrop of COVID 19 pandemic.
Key findings of the report
• Malaria cases and deaths
o An estimated 241 million malaria cases were reported in 2020 in 85 malaria-endemic countries, increasing from 227 million in 2019.
o Sub-Saharan Africa continues to carry the heaviest malaria burden, accounting for about 95% of all cases and 96% of deaths in 2020.
o Malaria deaths increased by 12% globally in 2020 compared with 2019.
• India related findings
o India accounted for 83% of cases in the WHO South-East Asia Region.
o India was the only high-burden country to record progress by sustaining a reduction in malaria burden between
2019 and 2020.
• Globally, 40 countries and territories have now been granted a malaria-free certification from WHO – including,
most recently, China, El Salvador, Argentina and Uzbekistan.
Measures taken to eliminate Malaria
• WHO Global Malaria Programme (GMP): It is responsible for coordinating WHO's global efforts to control and
eliminate malaria. Its work is guided by the Global technical strategy (GTS) for malaria 2016–2030 adopted by the
World Health Assembly in May 2015 and updated in 2021.
• Malaria Elimination Research Alliance (MERA)- India: Its purpose is to identify, articulate, prioritise and respond to
the research needs of the country in a coordinated and combinatorial way to eliminate malaria from India by 2030.
• E-2025 initiative: Under this, WHO has identified group of 25 countries with the potential to eradicate malaria by
2025.
• High Burden to High Impact (HBHI) initiative: In 2019, WHO has initiated the HBHI initiative in 11 high malaria burden
countries, including India (West Bengal and Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh).
About Malaria
• It is a life-threatening mosquito borne blood disease caused by
plasmodium parasites, and spread through the bites of
infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
• There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and
2 of these species – P. falciparum (African continent) and P.
vivax (outside of sub-Saharan Africa) – pose the greatest threat.
• It is preventable as well as curable.
• Malaria Vaccine
o WHO has recommended broad use of the RTS,S/AS01
(RTS,S) malaria vaccine among children living in regions
with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission.
o Known by its brand name Mosquirix, this recombinant
protein vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce
malaria, and deadly severe malaria among young children,
and also reduced the overall hospital admissions.
94 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• National Strategic Plan for Malaria
Elimination (2017-22): It gives year
wise elimination targets in various
parts of the country depending
upon the endemicity of malaria in
the next 5 years.
• Ministerial Declaration on
Accelerating and Sustaining
Malaria Elimination in South-East
Asia Region (SEAR): India is a
signatory to it, which was signed in
New Delhi by health ministers of
countries of the WHO- SEAR.
• National Task Force on Malaria
Elimination: It was formed to
promote intersectoral cooperation
and engagement of all
stakeholders.
• Parliamentary and Legislative
Forum on Malaria Elimination was
formed.
## 7.8. TRANS FATS
Why in news?
World Health Organisation (WHO)
released the third progress report on
Global trans-fat elimination 2021
titled ‘Countdown to 2023’.
Key highlights of the report
• Progress in efforts worldwide:
Since may 2020, there has been
significant progress in TFA
elimination around the world.
o Mandatory Trans Fatty Acids
(TFA) elimination policies are
currently in effect in 57
countries; of these, 40
countries (mostly among the
high income countries) have
best-practice policies in effect,
covering 1.4 billion people
(18% of the global
population).
• Best performers: India and the
Philippines became the first and
second lower-middle-income
countries to pass a best-practice policy.
• Challenges to TFA policy-making faced by countries over the past year were resource and capacity constraints due
to the COVID-19 pandemic.
95 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
About Trans Fatty Acid (TFA)
• Trans fat, or trans-fatty acids, are unsaturated fatty acids that come from either natural or industrial sources:
o Naturally occurring trans-fat come from ruminants (cows and sheep).
o Industrially produced trans-fat are found in hardened vegetable fats such as margarine and are often present in
snack foods, baked goods and fried foods.
✓ Industrially produced trans-fats are formed in a process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil converting the
liquid into a solid, resulting in “partially hydrogenated” oil (PHO).
✓ Manufacturers often use them as they have a longer shelf life and are cheaper than other fats.
• Health Impacts: Intake of TFA is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and death from coronary heart
disease.
o Approximately 540,000 deaths each year globally and 60,000 in India can be attributed to intake of industrially
produced trans fatty acids.
o People living with cardiovascular disease, are especially at risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19.
Steps taken by WHO to eliminate Trans Fats from food supplies
WHO identified TFA elimination as one of the priority targets in its 13th General Programme of Work (GPW13). In 2018, WHO
called for the global elimination of industrially produced TFA by 2023.
• REPLACE action framework: It provides a roadmap for
countries to eliminate industrially produced TFA from
their food supplies.
o WHO recommends that trans-fat intake be
limited to less than 1% of total energy intake i.e.,
less than 2.2 g/day with a 2,000-calorie diet.
• Additional resources to support country actions: This
include six REPLACE implementation modules and a
live policy tracking map – the TFA Country Score Card–
to monitor global progress towards the 2023 target.
• TFA indicator that records whether countries have
adopted WHO best-practice policies for eliminating industrially produced TFA.
o This is one of the indicators in the WHO Triple Billion Indicators, an ambitious initiative to improve the health of billions of
people by 2023.
• WHO Certification Programme for Trans Fat Elimination: The programme aims to accelerate progress towards the 2023 goal
for global elimination by recognizing countries that have eliminated industrially produced TFA from their national food
supplies. It also establishes country accountability.
o To qualify for certification, countries must demonstrate that a best- practice TFA policy has been implemented.
How is India progressing towards TFA elimination?
To eliminate industrially produced TFA in oils and foods, FSSAI – the national food regulator, within the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare – has adopted a 360-degree approach which includes developing policies and regulations, capacity-
building for laboratories and food businesses, increasing awareness, etc. Following steps have been taken in recent times:
• Goal setting: In 2018, India called for action to make the country TFA free by 2022, a year ahead of the WHO global
target of 2023.
o Target is to reduce TFA in all food products containing oils and fats to less than 2% in a phased manner: to not
more than 3% from 1 January 2021 and not more than 2% from 1 January 2022.
• Labelling of TFA: Food establishments can display the “Trans Fat Free” logo in their outlets and on their food products
if the food contains less than 0.2 g of TFA per 100 g or 100 mL and if edible oils or fats contain less than 1 g of TFA per
100 g or 100 mL.
• Behaviour Change Communication: Multilingual Mass media campaign, “Heart Attack Rewind” was launched to
create a demand for healthier alternatives to Partially hydrogenated oils.
o Other strategies include celebrity endorsements for wider appeal and providing information to consumers on
strategies to eliminate TFA from their diets.
• Technology adoption: Nudging Food businesses to adopt technologies to eliminate TFA in the food chain.
96 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Capacity Building Strengthening Laboratories and Surveillance to provide a baseline so as to strategize the next steps
for implementation of the regulation.
What more can be done in India?
• Capacity building and additional technical assistance to Small and Medium Food enterprises to develop their skills
in reformulation to produce healthier and cost-effective alternatives to TFAs.
• Mandatory labelling of TFA and saturated fat content for all edible oils and food products should be implemented.
• For proper implementation in India, FSSAI will need to pursue local governments to improve surveillance, inspection
of food premises, sampling of food products, regular training of officers, upgradation of food labs, etc.
• Role of Civil Society: Civil society organisations should play an important role in informing the public, providing
support for draft legislation/ regulation and monitoring implementation.
Conclusion
As more and more countries regulate TFA, food manufacturers can reformulate products in for sale in multiple countries.
This can reduce research and development costs, and allow easier trade between countries and within regions.
Taking action to prevent cardiovascular diseases will not only save lives, but will also support economic and health system
recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic by making future generations healthier and more resilient to infectious
disease.
What are fats and fatty acids?
Fats are a group of chemical compounds that contain fatty acids.
Fats are the sources of energy and also act as main constituents of
cellular membranes assuring the fluidity, flexibility, permeability of
the membrane.
The terms fat and fatty acids are frequently used interchangeably.
What are the different types of fatty acid?
There are two main types of fatty acids: saturated and unsaturated.
All fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms
attached to the carbon atoms.
• Saturated fatty acid has the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms attached to every carbon atom. It is therefore said
to be "saturated" with hydrogen atoms, and all of the carbons are attached to each other with single bonds.
• Unsaturated fatty acid: If the carbon chain has fewer hydrogen atoms, it is said to be unsaturated. These are further divided
into monounsaturated and polyunsaturated depending on the nature and number of bonds between carbon atoms.
o Omega 3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids (also termed as essential fatty acid) with a double bond at the third
carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. Marine algae and phytoplankton are primary sources of omega-3 fatty
acids.
Are all food fats bad for the body?
• The fat in foods contains a mixture of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In foods of animal origin,
a large proportion of fatty acids are saturated. In contrast, in foods of plant origin and some seafood, a large proportion of the
fatty acids are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated.
• Saturated and Trans fats raise LDL (or "bad") cholesterol levels in the blood, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease.
Unsaturated fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, do not raise LDL cholesterol and are beneficial when
consumed in moderation.

• Web 3.0 is the next stage of the web evolution that
would make the internet more intelligent or process
information with near-human-like intelligence
97 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
through the power of AI systems that could run smart
programs to assist users.
o The goal of Web 3.0 is to create more intelligent,
connected, and open websites.
• Web 1.0, also called the Static Web, which started in
the 1990s enabled easy access to information.
However, the information was largely disorganised and
difficult to navigate.
• The Social Web, or Web 2.0, made the internet a lot
more interactive thanks to advancements in web
technologies like Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, etc., which
enabled startups to build interactive web platforms
such as YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia and many
more.
• Significance of Web 3.0
o Data will be more relevant to each user: Web 3.0
is being referred to by experts as the semantic
web; semantic meaning data driven. The data will
come from the user and the web will essentially
adjust to meet the needs of the user. For example,
if you do a lot of searching for ‘design blogs’, you’ll
receive more advertisements related to design.
o Decentralised data networks: In Web 3.0, data will
be connected in a decentralized way, unlike
generation 2.0 of the internet in which data is
primarily stored in centralized storage locations. In
Web 3.0, users will also be able to interact with
data using AI and machine learning technology.
✓ It will open the internet to new search engines
or social networks with the control over
content not restricted to just a few companies.
o Ensure data security and privacy: Web 3.0 is
believed to be more user-specific, which will
ensure data security and privacy while avoiding the
risk of Internet hacking.
o Economic growth: It can help India contribute an
additional $1.1 trillion of economic growth to its
GDP over the next 11 years.
7.9.2. OSCAR 1 (ORBITING SATELLITES
CARRYING AMATEUR RADIO)
• It was launched successfully in December, 1961, (60
years ago) and first non-governmental satellite that
was built by private citizens.
• It was the first satellite to reach its own orbit after
being ejected as a secondary payload of another
primary mission.
• It was deployed in low-Earth orbit, just above the
atmosphere and its function post deployment was to
transmit the letters “HI” in Morse code.
• Ever since the launch of OSCAR I in 1961, it has been
traditional for amateur radio satellites to carry the
name OSCAR, and 111 satellites have received the
OSCAR designations so far.

• It will help in answering questions like How do black
holes spin, How do pulsars shine so brightly etc.
7.9.4. SCIENTISTS TRACE FIRST CLUE TO
UNDERSTAND TRANSIENT HIGH ENERGY
PULSES FROM MAGNETARS
• A magnetar is a type of neutron star. In a typical
neutron star, magnetic field is trillions of times that of
the Earth’s magnetic field; however, in a magnetar,
magnetic field is another 1000 times stronger.
o Neutron stars are formed when a massive star
(with a core between 1 and 3 solar masses) runs
out of fuel and collapses, crushing together every
proton and electron into a neutron.
o Stars with higher masses will continue to collapse
into stellar-mass black holes.
• Magnetars suffer violent eruptions that are still little
known due to their unexpected nature and short
duration, of barely tenths of a second.
• Recently, Scientists have found the first clues to
understand these eruptions.
o It is believed that eruptions in magnetars may be
due to instabilities in their magnetosphere or to a
kind of earthquakes (starquakes) produced in their
crust.
98 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
o These triggers create waves (called Alfvén waves)
in magnetosphere of the magnetars and while
interacting with each other waves dissipate
energy.
## 7.9.5. NATIONAL OXYGEN STEWARDSHIP
PROGRAMME
• Union government has launched an initiative to train
health care workers in rational utilisation of medical
oxygen to prevent wastage.
• About National Oxygen Stewardship Programme
o As part of the programme, at least one oxygen
steward will be identified and trained in each
district across the country.
o These trained professionals would be responsible
for leading the training on oxygen therapy and
management in their respective districts.
o They will also support audit of oxygen delivery and
preparedness for a surge scenario.
## 7.9.6. GOVERNMENT PROHIBITS USE OF TB ANTIBIOTICS ON CROPS
• Recently, the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare notified the draft order on ‘Prohibition of Streptomycin and Tetracycline inAgriculture’.
o The antibodies, Streptomycin and Tetracycline are important medicines used in the treatment of tuberculosis in human beings.
o The use of antibiotics leads directly to the development and spread of resistance. o It was also observed that the overutilization of the TB antibodies on crops is not healthy for human beings, plants, and the soil.
• According to the draft Order
o No person shall import, manufacture, or formulate Streptomycin and Tetracycline for use in agriculture in India with effect from February 1, 2022.
o There will be a complete ban on the use of Streptomycin and Tetracycline in agriculture from January 1, 2024.
• The draft Order also stated that every State government shall take all steps necessary for the execution of the Order in their State, under the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 and rules framed thereunder.
o The Insecticides Act, 1968 is to regulate the import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution and use of insecticide with a view to prevent risk to human beings or animals and for matters connected therewith.
## 7.9.7. WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY
• World Health Assembly has kickstarted global process to draft and negotiate a convention, agreement or other international instrument to protect the world from future infectious disease crises.
• Article 19 of the WHO Constitution provides the World Health Assembly with the authority to adopt conventions or agreements on any matter within WHO’s competence.
o The sole instrument established to date is ‘WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control’, which has made a significant contribution in protecting people from tobacco since it came into force in 2005.
• The Assembly adopted a sole decision titled: “The World Together” that establishes an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) to draft and negotiate the instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.
o The body will hold public hearings, deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023 and submit its outcome for consideration by the 77th World Health Assembly in 2024.
## 7.9.8. GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY INDEX
(GHSI) 2021
• GHSI measures capacities of 195 countries to prepare for epidemics and pandemics.
o It was jointly released by non-profits Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
• Key Findings
o Countries across all income levels remain dangerously unprepared to meet future epidemic and pandemic threats.
o World’s overall performance on GHSI score slipped to 38.9 (out of 100) in 2021 (40.2 in 2019). India also slipped.
o Most countries have not made dedicated financialinvestments in strengthening epidemic or pandemic preparedness.
## 7.9.9. SCIENTISTS DEVELOPED FIRST LIVING ROBOTS THAT CAN REPRODUCE
• World’s first living robots, called Xenobots, were
formed from the stem cells of the African clawed frog
(Xenopus laevis) from which it takes its name.
o Xenobots are less than a millimeter wide and
could move, work together in groups and self-
heal.
o Stem cells are unspecialized cells that have the
ability to develop into different cell types.
99 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Now, scientists have discovered an entirely new form
of biological reproduction different from any animal or
plant to create first-ever, self-replicating living robots.
o Researchers used artificial intelligence (AI) to
design a blueprint for organising xenobots into a
new type of organism.
✓ Unlike in cloning, where DNA from one
individual is used to grow identical copies of
that individual, these cells are harvested from
different embryos, and used to create
organisms that don’t resemble their parent
species.
• Potential applications of Xenobots
o To clean up plastic pollution, both in sea and on
land.
o If built with mammalian stem cells, xenobots could
be organised to form lenses to restore vision.
o To clean up plaque that causes heart blocks, or
brain damage.
o Could be programmed to attack and remove
cancer cells.
## 7.9.10. GREEN HYDROGEN MICROGRID PROJECT
• Recently, NTPC awarded India’s first Green Hydrogen-
based Microgrid Project at Simhadri, Andhra Pradesh.
o It would be a precursor to large scale hydrogen
energy storage projects.
• Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into
hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyzer powered
by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar
• Project offers benefits of decarbonising far-off regions
(e.g. Ladakh) and meet the clean energy goals because
of its features like sustainability, easy to store etc.

## 8.1. INDIAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT & THE ROLE OF SCIENCE
Why in news?
Recently, a two-day National Conference on 'Indian Independence Movement & the Role of Science' was organised.
More on news
• This national conference was held as a part of the 75th year of India’s independence celebrations.
• Conference was organized by CSIR-National Institute of Science Communication & Policy Research (CSIR-NIScPR) in
association with Vigyan Prasar, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and Vijnana Bharati
(VIBHA).
• The conference was focused on science as tool for subjugation and liberations, the roles of scientists, institutions,
movement, policy and planning and the vision of scientists were also discussed.
Science as tool for subjugation
Strategy Examples
Science as a Tool of
British Exploitation
of India
Survey of India (founded in 1767), Great Trigonometrical Survey of India (GTS) (established in 1818) &
Indian Railways (established in 1853) all were established for exploration of rich metal areas and their
transportation to the presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras
Science ‘Apartheid’
in British Raj
• Radhanath Sikdar was the first person to calculate the height of the highest mountain the Mount
Everest.
• Kishori Mohan Bandhopadhyay played vital role in discovery of malarial parasite for which Sir Ronald
Ross received the Nobel Prize.
• Seebchunder Nandy and rendered excellent services to the British government during the Mutiny of 1857 as the inspector.
However, none of them got their due credits and were discriminated in terms of low salary, no
promotion, etc.
Science as tool for liberations
The opening of new educational institutions in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay by the British was in line with their intention
to prepare a more skilled and learned workforce. The young brigade of scientists coming out of these institutions wanted
to break the shackles of the myth that Indians could not think scientifically, did not have logical thinking, and could not
do original research in the prevailing fields during those days. This led to birth of many scientific institution by Indians:
• Indian Association for Cultivation of Science (IACS): It was established by Dr Mahendralal Sircar with an objective to
enable natives of India to cultivate science in all of its departments with a view to its advancement by original research. The IACS started with seven frontline areas of work viz. Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, Systematic botany, Systematic zoology, Physiology, and Geology.
• The Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Workshop: It was established by Acharya P. C. Ray in 1901. It was the foundation stone of indigenous industry in our country.
• Indian Institute of Science (IISC): It was established Sir Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata in 1908 on the suggestions of Swami
Vivekanada made during their voyage from Japan to Chicago in 1893.
• Calcutta Mathematical Society: It was established in 1908, to generate opportunities and contribute to mathematics
by Indian students.
• Bose Research Institute: It was established by Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose in 1917 who also dedicate this institute - not
merely a laboratory but a temple which was later known as Basu Vigyan Mandir.
o Bose was an extraordinary physicist, botanist and biologist of the time, demonstrated wireless transmission of
electromagnetic radiations. Bose lived his life with the Indian philosophical thoughts of ‘Vasudhaiva
Kutumbakam’ by not patenting his research in the interest of humanity. A man of high calibre, his experiments
discovered and proved the existence of life and sensitivity in plants through his innovative techniques and

• Maharashtra Association for Cultivation of Science (MACS): Inspired by Sircar’s IACS, MACS was established by Prof
Shankar Purushottam Agharkar in Pune in 1946. The institute was named after him in 1992 as the Agharkar Research
Institute.
o He was an Indian morphologist and an expert on the biodiversity of Western Ghats, where he discovered the
freshwater jellyfish, generally found in Africa.
Conclusion
To conclude, we can infer that the establishments started by the British in India had the sheer aim to loot India and
generate lower-income labour to increase their revenue. Therefore, the majority of institutions established by native
Indians were highly spiritual in developing the Swadeshi spirit and nationalistic approach among the people of India.

9. ETHICS
## 9.1. MOB VIOLENCE AND LYNCHING
Introduction
Mob Violence or Lynching is one of the major challenges to
State authority. Though it can be done by group of people
in rage, typically it involves vigilante group, i.e. self-
appointed doer of justice, who keep watch over people
and punish them in their own way (Vigilantism).
In both forms, it goes against the rule of law and notion of
a civilized society due to the destructive expression of
emotions in it for immediate gratification.
About Mob Violence/lynching
• Mob Violence or Mob Lynching is defined as targeted
homicidal aggression, including killing, against a
person/s by a group of people or mob to-
○ Punish for a crime actually committed or mere
suspicion based on allegations or misinformation,
○ The targeting can be for a serious crime in the eyes
of law or merely to suppress the tendency of deviance from the ideology of the mob.
• Fundamentally, it is seen in two ways as-
○ Defence of society, i.e. protest against anarchy, due to failure of law enforcement agencies in curbing the issues
of cow theft, kidnapping, crimes etc. or
○ Offence against society, i.e. return of anarchy, as it goes against the fundamental principle of law, i.e. what the
law provides must be taken by lawful means. Self-appointed people holds no right to undertake law enforcement
• Ethically, it goes against the moral principles like fairness and reasonableness. If it is not controlled, it may give rise
to social hatred with increased tendency of mass criminal outburst, ultimately leading to a state of anarchy.
Reasons behind Lynching
• Religious Beliefs or Principles: Being a multi-religious and pluralistic society, the religious beliefs or principles play an
important role with imposition of one’s beliefs on others. E.g. The recent killings in Punjab over sacrilege issue or
bovine-related mob-lynching.
• Socio-cultural Influences: This includes the historical socio-cultural norms or moral principles which govern a person's
behaviour or attitude towards an action. E.g. From 2000-2012, nearly 2,097 lynching due to witchcraft were reported
from 12 states of India.
• Feelings of Fear or Hate: Often, the rumors of being kidnappers or actual action of person/s give rise to lynching. E.g.
the killing of Sadhus in Palghar on rumor. Similarly, in Dimapur (2015) an
angry mob lynched a rape accused by breaking into the prison.
• Lack of trust in the efficacy of laws: Either due to dissatisfaction from
implementation of laws or judicial delays, mob justice is seen by non-state
actors as a discharge of public duty.
What are the ethical issues it creates?
• Dehumanization of the victim: Lynching incidents lead to dehumanisation of individuals or groups leading to
ghettoization and hate crimes.
• Denial of Justice: Lynching goes against the rule of law and the extra-judicial elements or non-state actors’ award
punishment beyond what is deserved under laws.
Note: Due to lack of definition and
unreliable data, National Crime Records
Bureau (NCRB) stopped collecting data
on mob lynching, cow vigilantism and
other such crimes after 2017.
108 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Otherization of the Society: Lynching leads to higher distrust among people and society becomes more mechanical
rather than organic, i.e. homogeneity based integration. Being a nation with large diversity, it can create challenges
to the unity of nation.
• Creation of an atmosphere of fear: The level of intolerance and private security need rises in society as more people
start taking law into their own hands for justice.
• Encourages use of violence: If not resolved, lynching boosts confidence of non-state actors and violence gains
acceptance. If not controlled, it can be used over non-agreement and becomes a threat to individual liberty,
rationality and logical discussion.
Solution to Lynching: Current Framework and Other
steps needed to stop Lynching
With growing use of social media by non-state actors to
gain public attraction, mobilise people and target
individuals through false allegations, solution to
lynching is essential not only for sustenance of law and
order but for nation building as well.
Current Framework
• With police and public order being part of state
subjects, India lacks a single law to specifically deal
with mob lynching.
• In Tehseen Poonawalla vs UOI (2018), Supreme
Court issued preventive, remedial and punitive
guidelines to deal with mob violence and lynching
• Calling it a “horrendous act of mobocracy”, the
Supreme Court also asked Parliament to establish
lynching as a separate offence with punishment.
• Presently, it is mainly dealt under various sections
of IPC with a handful of states taking legal initiatives. This includes- Manipur, West Bengal, Rajasthan and recently, by
the Jharkhand assembly.
Other Steps Needed
• Societal Approach: With involvement of beliefs and emotions, regulation of social behavior is first step to stop mob
violence and protect rights conferred to the citizens. This includes-
○ Respect for Law: Law is the mightiest sovereign of a civilized society. Efforts should be made to increase the
feeling of law being sacred in society.
○ Culture of duty: Efforts should be made to universalize the basic duties such as- Duty of Justice, Duty of
nonmaleficence etc. as part of social norms or actions.
• Governmental Approach: Apart from bringing laws and guiding society on social behavior, the government should
apply emotional intelligence to handle conflicts with equal condemnation of social and political violence to avoid
revenge tendencies.
• People-centric Approach: As society and government are made by the people, it is vital that people should seek true
freedom through a life based on reason (objectivity or rational will), self-control and virtues of empathy, compassion,
and humanity. As Thiruvalluvar, well-known poet and philosopher of ancient India, said
The first and most important thing a man should keep away from is not doing harm of any kind knowingly to anyone, at
any time.
