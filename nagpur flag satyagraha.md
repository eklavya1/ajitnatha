- [[_modern history 历史 MOC]]
- In March 1923, the Congress Working Committee which was to meet at [[Jabalpur]] Municipality passed a resolution to hoist the national flag over the Town Hall.
 - ◦ It was disallowed by the District Magistrate. Not only did he prohibit the flying of the national flag, but also the holding of a public meeting in front of the Town Hall.
 - ◦ The District Magistrate ordered the flag to be pulled down. The police exhibited their overzealousness by trampling the national flag under their feet. The insult to the flag sparked off an agitation. All the congress members of the Municipality resigned, and satyagraha was immediately launched by the Jabalpur District Congress Committee.
 - ◦ The satyagraha at [[Nagpur]] started on [[May]] 1st and continued up to August. The first commander of the satyagraha was Jamnalal Bajaj.
 - ◦ When Jamnalal Bajaj was arrested and sent to jail the All India Congress Committee requested Vallabhbhai to take charge of the satyagraha and he agreed readily.
 - ◦ Sardar Patel organized thousands of volunteers in processions of hoisting flags. He finally withdrew satyagraha after securing the release of all prisoners and permission to hoist the national flag in public.
