# elementary formulae on profit and loss
## 1. By selling an article for a, some loss is incurred & by selling it for b, there is a gain equal to the loss amount, then cp is -
cp = a+b/2
## 2. sp(a) = cp(b), then
gain,loss % = (b - a/a) x100
## 3. cp(a) = b & sp(b) = a
net gain,loss % = (a2 - b2 / b2) x 100
## 4. if article sold -->  gains a% then sold for ₹"q"--> gains b%
cp = (q/b-a) x 100
## 5. if article sold -->  loss a% then sold for ₹"q"--> gains b%
cp = (q/b+a) x 100

## Two articles having same selling price with a gain of x% on one and loss of x% on other, then there is a overall loss of
(x2 /100) %

## 1. profit or loss % = (P or L/ cp) x 100
## 2. sp = (100-loss% / 100) x cp
## 3. cp = (100/100 -loss%) x sp

## loss
## 2 articles having same selling price with a gain of x% on one and loss of x% on other, then there is a overall loss of
loss = (x2 / 100)%
## cp = (100/100-loss%) x sp
## sp = (100+profit)/100 x cp, when profit = p% of cp
## sp = (100-loss)/100 x cp, when loss = l% of cp
# discount
## discount = marked price - selling price #pneumonic _dms_
## if disc is r%, then
sp = (100-r)/100 x mp
## successive discount
net discount % = (r1+r2 - [r1 x r2/100] ) %
## false weight in place of actual weight
by using a false weight of x grams for a [[kilogram]] and selling it at a cost price,
shopkeper's gain % = ([1000-x / x] x 100)
