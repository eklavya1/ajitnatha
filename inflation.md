In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index. Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem. The consumer price index is often used for this purpose; the employment cost index is used for wages in the United States. Differential movement between consumer prices and wages constitutes a change in the standard of living. The causes of inflation have been much discussed (see below), the consensus being that growth in the money supply, alongside increased velocity of money, is typically the dominant causal factor.If money were perfectly neutral, inflation would have no effect on the real economy; but perfect neutrality is not generally considered believable. Effects on the real economy are severely disruptive in the cases of very high inflation and hyperinflation. More moderate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways. The negative effects include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity, allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation.

Today, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilising the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. Generally, these monetary authorities are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, by carrying out open market operations and (more rarely) changing commercial bank reserve requirements.

It is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time.
A quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy over some time.
The rise in the general level of prices often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.
Thus Inflation is the rate at which the value of a currency is falling and, consequently, the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
An increase in the supply of money is the root of inflation, though this can play out through different mechanisms in the economy.
An increase in the supply of money is the root of inflation. Money supply can be increased by the monetary authorities either by printing and giving away more money to the
individuals, by legally devaluing (reducing the value of) the legal tender currency, more (most commonly) by loaning new money into existence as reserve account credits
through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks on the secondary market.
In all such cases of money supply increase, the money loses its purchasing power. The mechanisms of how this drives inflation can be classified into three types: demand-pull
inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.

[[Capital]] is a vital ingredient for economic [[growth]] since most nations cannot meet their total capital requirements from intemal [[resource]]s alone, they turn to foreign investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) are two of the most common routes for investors to invest in an overseas economy. FPI means [[investing]] in financial [[asset]]s, such as stocks and bonds of entities located in another [[country]].
**Certain factors favor foreign investments such as -**
Political factors: political stability, favorable business policy.
Economic factors: the strength of the economy, GDP growth trends, infrastructure, inflation, lower currency risk.

As inflation is usually coupled with economic growth and it results in higher return in the form of equity for the investor. Inflation also affects the exchange rate; it leads to
the weaker domestic currency for investors hot currency. Therefore, it results in better returns for foreign investors in the form of exchange rates who had invested in the
host nation's financial assets.
## disadvantages of inflation
Inflation will reduce the real value of govemment bonds.
High inflation rates tend to cause uncertainty and confusion leading to less investment.
It is argued that countries with persistently higher inflation, tend to have lower rates of investment and economic growth.
Higher inflation leads to lower international competitiveness, leading to fewer exports and a deterioration in the current account balance of payments.
Inflation and stagnant wage growth lead to declining incomes.
Inflation can reduce the real value of savings, which might particularly affect old people who live on savings
Investors will demand higher bond yields to compensate; this will increase the cost of debt interest payments.
Hyper-inflation can destroy an economy.
If inflation gets out of hand, it can create a vicious cycle, where rising inflation, causes higher inflation expectations, which in turn pushes prices even higher.
Hyper-inflation can wipe out the savings of the middle-classes, and redistribute wealth and income towards those with debt and assets and property.

	- Inflation can be described as the general rise in the price of goods and services in an economy over time. It is calculated by tracking the increase in prices of essentials.
	-   **The Methods To Calculate Inflation [[CPI]]**
    -   The primary index that tracks the change in retail prices of essential goods and services consumed by Indian households is the Consumer Price [[Index]] or CPI. It shows the impact of inflation on people
    -   It is always used for Dearness Allowance. Now, it is also being used for [[monetary policy]] formulation.
    -   Since 2010, based on the Rangarajan Committee;s [[report]], [[CPI]] (URBAN), CPI (RURAL), [[CPI]] (COMBINED) and CFPI- food indice are calculated therein
    -   It covers both goods and services
    -   200 Goods and services are taken- It is a selected basket of goods and services. The weightage of food in the CPI is close to 50% (The weightage for food is lower in WPI). 

-   **WPI**
    -   While retail inflation looks at the price at which the consumer buys the product, WPI is measured based on prices at the wholesale level. WPI measures the changes in the prices of goods sold and traded in bulk by wholesale businesses to other businesses. It reflects the inflation in the economy in general/ general level of inflation or price level in the economy.
    -   Another difference between the two indices is that the wholesale market is only for goods, you cannot buy services on a wholesale basis. So WPI does not include services, whereas the retail price index does. WPI, unlike the Consumer Price Index (CPI), only tracks the prices of goods purchased by consumers.
    -   697 goods are taken:-Primary goods, Fuel and power and Manufacturing goods, the latter being given the maximum weightage (64.23%)
    -   Wholesale prices are considered
    -   Base year= 2012
    -   Based on the suggestions of the `Urjit Patel committee`, monetary policy (MP) in India is to be formulated in reference to the CPI (instead of WPI) based inflation. (The suggestion was accepted in 2014 itself.) The reason is that: i) CPI shows the impact on the people- WPI indicates the wholesale price, whereas CPI shows the retail price i.e. the price at which people make purchases from retail market. WPI does not show the impact of inflation on the people. Any policy should consider the impact on the people ii) WPI does not account for the price in services iii) It is an international best practice- most of the countries have shifted to CPI.
