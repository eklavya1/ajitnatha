colloids are mixtures in which microscopically dispersed insoluble particles of 1 substance are suspended in
another substance.
size of suspended particles in a colloid can range from 1 to 1000 nanometres.

solute particles do not settle down when mixture is left undisturbed. this means that colloids are quite
stable. 
colloids cannot be separated by process of filtration. they can be separated by centrifugation.
a colloid is a heterogeneous mixture & quite stable.
size of particles of a colloid is too small to be individually seen by naked eyes. so, statement 2 is not
correct.

common exs of colloids are-
