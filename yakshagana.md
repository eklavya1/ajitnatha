- Yakshagana, the traditional theatre form of [[Karnataka]], is based on [[mythology]]ical stories and [[Puranas]]. It is a traditional theatre form that combines [[dance]], music, dialogue, costume, make-up, and stage techniques with a unique style and form. The most popular episodes are from the [[mahabharata]] i.e. Draupadi swayamvar, Subhadra vivah, Abhimanyu vadh, Karna-Arjun yuddh and from [[Ramayana]] i.e. Raajyaabhishek, Lav-kush Yuddh, Baali-Sugreeva yuddha and Panchavati. Yakshagana is traditionally presented from dusk to dawn. It is believed to have evolved from pre-classical music and theater during the period of the [[Bhakti movement]].
