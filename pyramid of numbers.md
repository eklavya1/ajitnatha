The pyramid of numbers represents the total number of individuals of different species (population) at each trophic level.
Depending upon the size, the pyramid of numbers may not always be upright, and may even be completely inverted.
It is very difficult to count all the organisms, in a pyramid of numbers and so the pyramid of numbers does not completely define the trophic structure for an ecosystem.
