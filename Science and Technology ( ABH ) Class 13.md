Science and Technology ( ABH ) Class 13

A brief recap of last class

Talked about Raman Spectroscopy, the contribution of Indians in science and technology.

Dr Satyendra Nath Bose and his contribution  (1:17:00 PM)

UPSC Q (2018, 10 marks): What was the contribution of SN Bose in Bose-Einstein statistics which revolutionized the field of physics.

Statistical Physics: (1:20:00 PM)

It is basically a description of how small particles like electrons, protons, etc. are arranged at different energy levels.
Boltzman is known as the father of statistical physics.
Professor Bose wanted to understand the statistical distribution of photons.
It was Bose who figured out how photons would behave assuming them to be identical.
Those identical particles are called Bosons.
The generalized rules guiding these Bosons are known as Bose-Einstein Statistics.
He transited from Classical statistics to Quantum Statistics.
Before Bose, statistical physics was based on the assumption that particles are distinguishable.
Fermi-Dirac statistics say that only two particles can stay at the same energy level. And the particles which follow this rule is called Fermions.
Whereas in Bose-Einsteins’ statistic any number of particles can remain in the same energy level.
Satyendra Nath Bose was one of the World’s pioneering theoretical physicists.
He is widely known for his work on Bosons, a class of particles named after him.
Professor Bose sent this paper to Einstein, who recognized the value of his calculation and generalized it for other particles also who will follow this statistical law.
Einstein propounded an Idea that at a very low temperature close to absolute zero (0 Kelvin (K) or -273°C), all Boson particles will be at a single stage at the lowest energy.
And this will lead to a new state of matter known as Bose-Einstein condensate.
5th State of the matter: Bose-Einstein condensate and it exists at a very low temperature (-250°C).
Bose-Einstein Condensate has amazing properties such as single quantum stage, superconductivity, superfluidity, reduces velocity of light, etc.

Standard Model: (2:04:00 PM)

It deals with three questions:
What is the fundamental building block of this universe?
What are the fundamental interacting forces governing these particles?
It also asks, how do these particles get their masses?
The model recognizes three forces: Electromagnetic interaction (by photons), strong interaction (by gluons), and weak interactions (W and Z Boson).
It is a theory of fundamental particles and how they interact.
As per this model, the matter is made of 6 Quarks and 6 leptons, they interact via three fundamental interactions weak force, electromagnetic force, and strong force.
The standard model does not account for gravity.
If the above three fundamental forces at the nuclear level can be combined together, then this description is called Grand Unified theory.
If Grand Unified theory can be combined with gravity, then it is called Theory of Everything.
String Theory and Quantum Loop Gravity are two popular candidates of Theory of Everything. However, we have no way of knowing if one of them or either of them is correct.

Dr. Subrahmanyam Chandrasekhar (3:05:00 PM)

    He was awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1983 for his theoretical studies of the structure and evolution of stars.
    He hypothesized that if a star is much heavier than the Sun (>1.44 times the mass of Sun) then the white dwarf stage will not be a stable stage.
    Stars will further collapse because of their own gravitational self-attraction.
    This leads to the Supernova explosion, which is one of the brightest events in the universe.
    These stars can evolve into neutron stars or a black hole which are two of the densest objects in the Universe.
    Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that emit high radiation at regular intervals.

Dark Matter (3:22:00 PM)

    Visible matters do not have enough gravitational pull to hold the galaxy together.
    Therefore, scientists believe that a type of matter which is invisible to light exists in the universe known as dark matter.
    Dark Energy: Physicists had assumed that attractive forces of gravity would slow down the expansion of the universe over time.
    However, different experiments have confirmed that this expansion is actually speeding up instead of slowing down.
    Scientists have coined the term Dark Energy to explain this phenomenon.
    This entire universe is made of 68% of dark energy, about 27% of dark matter and only about 5% of the matter is visible to us.
    90% of the visible matter is in the plasma state.

Space-Time Relationship by Einstein (3:55:00 PM)

    Special Theory of Relativity: It has two postulates. 
    Laws of physics remain the same in all inertial frames.
    The velocity of light is constant in all frames.
    Predictions of the theory: space and time are the same, time is just another dimension, prediction is length contraction and time dilation.
    General Theory of Relativity: gravity and space-time are related.
    Predictions of the theory: space is expanding, gravitational waves exist, black hole exists, and light will bend towards heavy objects.
