The Election Commission's Model Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines issued to regulate political parties and candidates prior to elections.
These rules are evolved through consensus among the political parties.
o It has no statutory backing.
o Simply put, this means anybody breaching the MCC can't be proceeded against under any clause of the Code.
• Everything is voluntary. The EC uses moral sanction or censure for its enforcement.
The rules range from issues related to speeches, polling day, polling booths, portfolios, the content of election manifestos, processions and general conduct so that free and fair elections are conducted.
According to the Press Information Bureau, a version of the MCC was first introduced in the state assembly elections in Kerala in [[1960]].
o It was largely followed by all parties in the 1962 elections and continued to be followed in subsequent general elections.
The MCC comes into force from the date the election schedule is announced until the date that results are out.
The MCC contains eight provisions dealing with general conduct, meetings, processions, polling day, polling booths, observers, the party in power, and election manifestos.
As soon as the code kicks in, the party in power — whether at the Centre or in the States — should ensure that it does not use its official position for campaigning.
In October 1979, the EC added a section to regulate the 'party in power and prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage at the time of elections.
o Hence, no policy, project or scheme can be announced that can influence the voting behaviour.
o The party must also avoid advertising at the cost of the public exchequer or using official mass media for publicity on achievements to improve chances of victory in the elections.
o The code also states that the ministers must not combine official visits with election work or use official machinery for the same.
o The ruling party also cannot use govemment transport or machinery for campaigning. It should also ensure that public places such as maidans etc., for holding
election meetings, and facilities like the use of helipads are provided to the opposition parties on the same terms and conditions on which they are used by the party in power.
o The issue of advertisement at the cost of public exchequer in the newspapers and other media is also considered an offence.
o The ruling government cannot make any ad-hoc appointments in Government, Public Undertakings etc. which may influence the voters
