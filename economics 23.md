economics class 23

an overview of the previous class was given. (1.07 pm) 

## calculation of inflation (1.15 pm)
- month over month comparison- comparing 2 successive months.
- quarter over quarter- comparing 2 successive quarters.
- year over a year - comparison is done for 2 successive years.
- eg- 2020 over 2019.
## inflation index
- we take a base year so that a long-term trend is found out.
- inflation is measured by comparing the indices of this year with the previous year for the same month.
- we do not measure month-over-month inflation that is feb over jan or march over feb.
- let us assume that 2012 is the base year.
- the basket of goods and services is constructed in a manner that reflects the expenditure incurred by a specific group of people. eg- the group of people may be agricultural labourers, industrial workers, an average urban or rural household or goods that are exchanged in the wholesale market, etc.
## different indices:
cpi- urban/ rural
cpi- iw/ al
wpi
ppi- this is from the producer’s perspective.
in the base year, the value of the basket is 100rs.
measuring inflation:
by how much prices are changed with respect to the previous year.
to calculate the change in prices, we construct a basket of goods and services that is relevant to a specific group of people. eg- rural areas, urban areas, etc.
we choose some years as the base years for subsequent comparison.
we construct a basket for that particular year.
we index the value of that basket to 100.
## cpi
(2.07 pm)
change in consumer prices is measured by cpi combined, rural and urban.
wpi- to know the change in prices of goods that are transacted in the wholesale market.
ppi- we do not measure ppi in india.
dictation (2.25 pm)
inflation is measured in the following manner:
first, we choose a year as the base year and construct a basket of goods relevant for the section for which we want to measure a change in prices.
the price of this basket of goods and services is collected from the relevant market that is if the basket pertains to consumers then prices are collected from the consumer market or if the basket pertains to the whole seller then the price is collected from the wholesale market.
similarly, rural-urban and such other distinctions are also taken into account while collecting prices.
the value of the basket of goods and services is found out for every month in the base year.
this value is indexed to 100 units for each month.
in subsequent years, the value of the basket is found out for the specific month and by comparing the prices in this month over the prices in the same month of the previous year, the rate of inflation is calculated.
at the same time, the index of the month is calculated by the base month’s index.
indexing is a convenient method to convey the change in prices.
if the value of the index in december 2021, is 150, this would mean that prices in dec 2021 are 50% higher than they were in the base year.
*base effect- is an effect that is observed when the base of comparison (not the base year, usually the previous year) is unusually high or low. eg- if in the previous year (2020), the prices increased over 2019 by a large degree, say 10% the inflation in 2020 has been 10%.
- further, in 2021, inflation would be measured with respect to 2020 which is already a high price year.
   even when the price rise in 2021, would be significant, it would not be properly captured in the rate of inflation because the base ie 2020 was itself very high.
- the rate of inflation in 2021 may only be 3% but it is above the base of 2020 where it was very high i.e. 10%.

## wpi and ppi
(2.40 pm)
-  in india, we do not have ppi which measures the change in prices at the producer level.
-  ppi can be calculated at the input as well as the output level ie we can measure the change in prices of inputs at the producer level or of outputs.
-  ppi is proposed so that a better idea can be had about how much change in the prices at the producer’s level is being transmitted to the prices at the wholesale and consumer levels.
-  in 2017, wpi was modified so that the prices at the wholesale level were collected after removing the effect of taxes.
-  this way wholesale prices and thus wpi moved closer to the producer’s prices.
-  indices and their releasing bodies along with the base year
-  cpi combined
-  cpi urban
-  cpi rural
-  cpi- aw
-  cpi- il
-  wpi
-  kindly complete this from the material.
-  rbi carries out a survey- inflation expectations survey.
-  based on this survey, the rbi finds out what level of inflation people are expecting.
-  it is a leading indicator of inflation.
-  other inflation types (3.01 pm)
## headline inflation
 which is concerned with policymaking.
 inflation targeting- rbi conducts monetary policy. it is based on inflation targets (it will be discussed in monetary policy)
 rbi targets the cpi of 2 to 6%.
 core inflation
 those goods and services are removed from the basket which is volatile in nature.
 eg- food and fuel component are removed.
 dictation (3.11 pm)
 headline inflation- it refers to the measure of inflation that is used in policymaking.
 cpi at present is the headline measure of inflation as it is used by the rbi for the conduct of monetary policy under the inflation-targeting framework.
 core inflation- refers to non-food and non-fuel inflation.
 the price of food and fuel item is volatile and therefore, it skews the inflation index.
 such volatile components are removed and core inflation is calculated.

## impact on inflation with respect to various entities in the economy (3.31 pm)
- effects on consumer vs. producers.
- consumer- it makes items expensive for the consumer.
- a consumer becomes relatively poorer because of higher consumption expenditure.
- producers benefit because of inflation.
- they will get a higher price for the goods.
- when the price rises within the range which is tolerant, then the consumer would not decrease consumption.
- price elasticity- impact on demand of a product with respect to change in price.

dication- (3.51pm)

- inflation causes higher outgo of consumption expenditure, therefore, the consumer suffers.
- the poor suffer much more than the rich because the percentage of income that the poor spend on consumption is much higher than the rich.
- for producer’s inflation is generally beneficial.
- this is so because their profit margins increase with an increase in prices.
- however, the benefit is dependent on:
- whether the producers are able to pass on the increased prices to the consumer.
- whether the increase in price is within the tolerance range of consumers so that the decline in consumption does not reduce the revenue collected by the producer.
- a low and steady rate of inflation is considered beneficial for the economy as a low rate of inflation is incentivizing for the producer to produce more and thus the output of the economy is expected to increase.
- a stable rate of inflation is desirable because stability helps in better planning.
- the consumers can plan their consumption expenditures and therefore negotiate for their wages whereas producers can plan their production and investments with reasonable rationality and thus the economy benefits.

## borrowers and lenders/ investment and savings
- time value of money and real interest rate
- inflation erodes the value of money over time.
- 100rs of today= 110rs of next year, if inflation is at the rate of 10%.
- real inflation rate= nominal interest rate- the rate of inflation.

the topic for the next class: inflation (to be continued…)
