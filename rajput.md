rajput (from sanskrit raja-putra, "son of a king") is a large multi-component cluster of castes, kin bodies, and local groups, sharing social status and ideology of genealogical descent originating from the indian subcontinent. the term rajput covers various patrilineal clans historically associated with warriorhood: several clans claim rajput status, although not all claims are universally accepted. according to modern scholars, almost all rajputs clans originated from peasant or pastoral communities.over the time, the rajputs emerged as a social class comprising people from a variety of ethnic and geographical backgrounds. during the 16th and 17th centuries, the membership of this class became largely hereditary, although new claims to rajput status continued to be made in the later centuries. several rajput-ruled kingdoms played a significant role in many regions of central and northern india from seventh century onwards.

the rajput population and the former rajput states are found in northern, western, central and eastern india as well as southern and eastern pakistan. these areas include rajasthan, haryana, gujarat, eastern punjab, western punjab, uttar pradesh, himachal pradesh, jammu, uttarakhand, bihar, madhya pradesh and sindh.
