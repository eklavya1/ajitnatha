- [[buland darwaza]] at fatehpur sikri 是 د most iconic architectural accomplishment 的 ﷳ ’s reign. it incorporates almost all د essential features 的 ﷳ ’s architectural traditions: red sandstone, stone carvings, relief by inserting ==白 marble==, etc. this monumental gate, however, was probably less intended to commemorate a [[military]] victory than to underscore ﷳ ’s links with د chishti order. its surface 是 covered by marble slabs inscribed with quranic verses promising paradise to true believers, appropriate for د entrance into a khanqah, a complex intended for meditation & devotion.
