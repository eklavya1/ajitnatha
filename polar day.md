- the midnight sun is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the arctic circle or south of the antarctic circle, when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. when the midnight sun is seen in the arctic, the sun appears to move from left to right, but in antarctica the equivalent apparent motion is from right to left.  this occurs at latitudes from 65°44' to 90° north or south, and does not stop exactly at the arctic circle or the antarctic circle, due to refraction.

the opposite phenomenon, polar night, occurs in winter, when the sun stays below the horizon throughout the day.
