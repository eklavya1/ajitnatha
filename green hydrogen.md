produced with help of electrolysis through electricity generated from renewable sources of energy such as solar & wind.
An electric current then splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen.
This ensures no greenhouse gas emissions as the only by-product of this process is oxygen, making it a great replacement for carbon-emitting fuels.
Green Chemicals like ammonia and methanol can directly be utilized in existing applications like fertilizers, mobility, power, chemicals, shipping etc.
Green Hydrogen blending up to 10% may be adopted in CGD networks to gain widespread acceptance.
It is a clean-buming molecule, which can decarbonize a range of sectors including iron and steel, chemicals, and transportation.
Renewable energy that cannot be stored or used by the grid can be channelled to produce hydrogen.
## Significance of Green Hydrogen -
• Green hydrogen energy is vital for India to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Targets and ensure regional and national energy security, access and availability.
• Green Hydrogen can act as an energy storage option, which would be essential to meet intermittencies (of renewable energy) in future.
• In terms of mobility, for long-distance mobilisations for either urban freight movement within cities & states or for passengers, Green Hydrogen can be used in railways, large ships, buses or trucks, etc.
