india vs china n africa- apart fm india & china, othr powrs such as [[united states of america]], eu, [[south korea]] r also present n africa, & thre xists sufficient space fr all these countries t co-xist & flourish n africa.
govt o india sd engage wd entire indian diasporc communty n india: nt limit its engagemt t elit sectn o indian diaspora alone. 
since india lacks deep pockets lk china, india sd involve privat sector, n its initiatv n africa. 
commn prceptn is "india promises, china delivrs." thus, india needs t focus n effectv delivry o various projects, it undrtakes n india.
with respect t racil violence, govt o india sd sensitize its citizens, while offrng speedy redressl o such grievances.
