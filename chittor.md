It lies on the Berach River, a tributary of the Banas, and is the administrative headquarters of Chittorgarh District. It was  capital of Rajput State of Medapata (modern Mewar) during 8th to 16th Century. The city of Chittorgarh is located on the banks of river Gambhiri and Berach.

Chittorgarh is home to the Chittor Fort, the largest fort in India and Asia. It was sacked thrice; first in 1303 by Alauddin Khalji, again in 1535 by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, and lastly by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1568. Its Hindu Rajput rulers fought fiercely to maintain their independence. On all three occasions when faced with a certain defeat, the men fought to death, while the women committed suicide by jauhar (mass self-immolation). Chittor also has been a land of worship for Meera, It is also known for Panna Dai.
