- eficiency is the highest form of beauty
efficiency is the (often measurable) ability to avoid wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired result. in a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste. "efficiency is thus not a goal in itself. it is not something we want for its own sake, but rather because it helps us attain more of the things we value". in more mathematical or scientific terms, it signifies the level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. it often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries.

- systems move from high [[friction]] to lesser one which has lesser state of it

key takeaways: (from kunal shah interview)
1. wasting resources is best form of signalling [[prosperity]]
2. how to bootstrap status? skills! eg. athletes
3. absence of father figures => demand for motivational figures (babas)
4. thinking is energy inefficient and most people avoid it
5. low trust => high friction transaction => high margins for platforms eg. cars24
6. how high-trust societies make it easy to conduct business and prosper (eg. palanpuri diamond traders and kutchi shopkeepers give loans w/o collateral)
7. how to increase trust? strong judiciary
8. never envy others achievements always envy their skills
