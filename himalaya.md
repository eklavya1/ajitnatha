- Himalayas, or Himalaya (; Sanskrit: [ɦɪmaːlɐjɐ]; from Sanskrit  himá 'snow, frost', &  ā-laya 'dwelling, abode'), are a mountain range in Asia separating plains of Indian subcontinent from Tibetan Plateau. range has some of planet's highest peaks, including highest, Mount Everest. Over 100 peaks exceeding 7,200 m (23,600 ft) in elevation lie in Himalayas. By contrast, highest peak outside Asia (Aconcagua, in Andes) is 6,961 m (22,838 ft) tall.The Himalayas abut or cross five countries: Bhutan, India, Nepal, China, & Pakistan. sovereignty of range in Kashmir region is disputed among India, Pakistan, & China. Himalayan range is bordered on northwest by Karakoram & Hindu Kush ranges, on north by Tibetan Plateau, & on south by Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of world's major rivers, Indus, Ganges, & Tsangpo–Brahmaputra, rise in vicinity of Himalayas, & their combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people; 53 million people live in Himalayas. Himalayas have profoundly shaped cultures of South Asia & Tibet. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism & Buddhism; summits of several—Kangchenjunga (from Indian side), Gangkhar Puensum, Machapuchare, Nanda Devi & Kailas in Tibetan Transhimalaya—are off-limits to climbers.

- Lifted by subduction of Indian tectonic plate under Eurasian Plate, Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km (1,500 mi) long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of northernmost bend of Indus river. Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, lies immediately west of great bend of Yarlung Tsangpo River. range varies in width from 350 km (220 mi) in west to 150 km (93 mi) in east.
