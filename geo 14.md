a brief recap of previous class

volcanism

vulcanism includes all processes involved in movement of molten material from interior of earth to surface.
it involves 3 main processes: generation of magma->intrusion of magma-> extrusion of magma
generation of magma- it's generated in lower layers of earth due to increase in heat (radioactivity), decrease in pressure (lowering of melting point), increase in water content (reduces melting points of rocks). any of above conditions may lead to melting of rocks

magma vs lava

magma- hot mobile molten silicate material (a combination of solid, liquid, & gases).
when magma reaches surface it erupts as lava.
lava is more volatile than magma & it cools either on surface or underwater. 

magma
lava
below 	above
temperature ↓ 	temperature ↑
fluidity ↓ 	fluidity ↑
leads to formation of plutonic rock 	volcanic rocks

types of magma

basaltic- silica <52%, dark color, denser, more fluid, high temperature, extrusive rocks, magnesium, iron
granitic- silica >52%, light color, lighter in density, less fluid, low temperature, intrusive rocks, silica, aluminium

magma generation & plate tectonics

divergent plate boundary- o-o & c-c divergence (basaltic magma. slow, continuous, quiet)
convergent plate boundary- o-c & o-c convergent (andesitic magma, fast, intermittent, explosive, volcanic arc)
volcanism along hotspots- results in eruption of basaltic magma due to its origin in mantle plumes in intraplate regions. eg: reunion hotspot, hawai hotspot, etc.

distribution of volcanoes

ridge volcanism(mid atlantic ridge, karlsberg ridge)
volcanic arcs (japan, kuril, aleutian, etc)
volcanic chains (along fold mountains)
volcanic clusters (along rift valleys)
volcanic lines (along with hotspots)

volcanic features

extrusive (above surface)
shield volcano: lava is very fluid & is capable of flowing for a very long distance; mountains formed are of large size & very slope; largest of all other types; made up of basaltic magma.
ash cinder cone: formed due to accumulation of loose particles around vent; continuous accumulation of ash increases size.
composite or strato volcano: formed due to accumulation of various volcanic materials with lava acting as cementing agents.
crater: depression at mouth of volcanic vent.
caldera: greatly enlarged depressions due to violent eruptions & subsidence of volcano.
flood basalt province: when highly fluid lava flows for long-distance & covers thousands of kilometers of area. eg: deccan province.
hot springs: when water sinks deep enough beneath surface to be heated by a hot spot or magma chamber, it rises to surface w/o any explosion. eg: tatapani (shimla)
geysers: it's a fountain of hot water + superheated steam ejected intermittently at regular intervals. eg: iceland.
fumaroles: these are continuous jet-like emissions of steam & other gases. 
intrusive (below surface)- batholith, lopolith, laccolith, phacolith, sill, dyke
batholith- these are large irregular dome-shaped features & a large body of magmatic material that cools in deeper depths of crust.
laccolith- it's a large blister of igneous mound with a dome-shaped or mushroom-shaped upper surface & a level base fed by a pip-like conduit from below.
lopolith- if magma solidifies in a saucer-shaped shallow basin it forms lopolith.
phacolith- it's formed by intrusion of magma along anticlines & synclines of folded layers below surface.
sills- these are horizontal layers of magma accumulation along bedding planes.
dykes- these are vertical wall-like formations due to accumulation of magma.
