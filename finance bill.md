- a government budget is a document prepared by the government and/or other political entity presenting its anticipated tax revenues (inheritance tax, income tax, corporation tax, import taxes) and proposed spending/expenditure (healthcare, education, defence, roads, state benefit) for the coming financial year. in most parliamentary systems, the budget is presented to the legislature and often requires approval of the legislature. through this budget, the government implements economic policy and realizes its program priorities. once the budget is approved, the use of funds from individual chapters is in the hands of government, ministries and other institutions. revenues of the state budget consist mainly of taxes, customs duties, fees and other revenues. state budget expenditures cover the activities of the state, which are either given by law or the constitution. the budget in itself does not appropriate funds for government programs, hence need for additional legislative measures.
