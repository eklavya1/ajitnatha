[Benefits of ISBN and Why it is important for book Publisher and Author](https://www.e-startupindia.com/learn/benefits-of-isbn-and-why-it-is-important-for-book-publisher-and-author/)
ISBNs were 10 digits in the range up to the end of December 2006, but after 1 January 2007, they continually consist of 13 digits.
ISBNs have prepared using a specific mathematical formula and include a check digit to validate the number.
ISBN is machine-readable in the form of a 13-digit EAN-13 bar code
ISBNs never expire, so you will have them available for future use as needed.
You can purchase ISBNs in advance and register your titles any time after they are obtained.

NOTE - Continuing resources include serials such as newspapers, periodicals, journals, magazines, blogs, etc., and ongoing integrating resources such as loose-leaf publications that are continually updated and web sites that are continually updated. Continuing resources do not qualify for assignment of ISBN.
