- rime ice forms when supercooled water liquid droplets freeze onto surfaces. meteorologists distinguish between three basic types of ice forming on vertical and horizontal surfaces by deposition of supercooled water droplets. there are also intermediate formations.

- soft rime is less dense than hard rime and is milky and crystalline, like sugar. soft rime appears similar to hoar frost.

- hard rime is somewhat less milky, especially if it is not heavy.

- clear ice is transparent and homogeneous and resembles ice-cube ice in appearance. its amorphous, dense structure helps it cling tenaciously to any surface on which it forms.both rime types are less dense than clear ice and cling less tenaciously, therefore damage due to rime is generally minor compared to clear ice.

- glaze ice is similar in appearance to clear ice but it is the result of a completely different process, occurring during freezing rain or drizzle.

- these three types occur also when ice forms on the surface of an aircraft, particularly on the leading edges and control surfaces,  when it flies through a cloud made of supercooled water liquid droplets. rime ice is the least dense, milky ice is intermediate and clear ice is the most dense. all forms of ice can spoil lift and may have a catastrophic effect on an airborne aircraft.  ice is hazardous to flight as it disrupts airflow, increases weight, and adds drag.  ice forming on propellers and/or engine inlets can cause severe vibration and/or damage if ingested.

- rime is also a weather form.
