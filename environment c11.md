Environment Class 11

Environmental Pollution (1.05 PM)

Pollution refers to unwanted/ undesirable changes in the physical, chemical, and biological properties of air, water, and soil.
As per Environmental Protection Act, 1986, Environmental pollution is defined as the presence in the environment of any environmental pollutant.
Environment pollutant means any solid, liquid, or gaseous substance present in such concentrations as maybe, or tend to be, injurious to the environment.
Types of pollution
Air pollution
Water pollution
Soil pollution
Noise pollution
Radiation pollution
Types of pollutants:
Solid: Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Dust, Silica, etc.
Liquid: eg- Municipal Sewage, Industrial effluent (tanneries)
Gaseous: CO, CO2, NOx,

Sources

Agriculture: Chemical pesticide, fertilizers, biomass, etc.
Industry: Chemicals, heavy metals, etc.
Domestic/ Municipal: Garbage, Plastic, e-waste
Primary pollutant: Direct Release and impacts. Eg- CO, CO2, NOx, etc.
Secondary pollutant: Chemical conversion of primary pollutant. Eg- smog, acid rain.

Air pollution (1.38 PM)

Gaseous pollutants- eg: CO2, NOx, SO2, etc.
Particulate Matter: size/ diameter of particle (micron= 10-6 m)
PM suspended in air are dust and soot released from the industrial chimneys, exhaust pipes of vehicles, mining and quarrying activities, burning of biomass, etc.
Their size ranges from 0.001 to 500 micrometers in diameter.
Particles less than 10 micrometers float and move freely with the air current.
Particles that are more than 10 micrometers in diameters settle down.

Fly Ash (1.43 PM)

It is ejected mostly by the thermal power plants as byproducts of coal-burning operations.
Fly ash pollutes air and water and may cause heavy metal pollution in water bodies.
Fly ash affects vegetation as a result of direct deposition on leaf surfaces.
Fly ash is now being used for the manufacturing of bricks, cement, landfill material, and construction of roads.

Problems/ Issues of air pollution

Human Health Impacts- Respiratory problems (asthma, Bronchitis, Lung disorders, etc)
Carcinogenic substances cause tumor/ cancer
Cardio Vascular Diseases
Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) - refers to the measurement of the overall disease burden expressed in the number of years lost due to ill health, disability, or early death.
Air pollution is now considered a leading killer in developing and least developed countries where the life span of people is decreasing due to exposure to harmful air pollutants.
Acidification
Acid rain, acid hail, etc.
Deposition on soil, water
Cause: SO2 and NOx
Impacts: Decline in productivity of the ecosystem
Impacts on aquatic organisms
Acidification of soil causes nitrogen-fixing bacteria inactive that impacts yield of crops.
Monuments/ archeological sites/ Sculptures- made up of stones like marble is impacted.

Smog
Winter smog (Smoke+ fog)
Eg- London, Delhi
Summer Smog- Photochemical smog
NO2+O2--> sunlight NO+O3 (Ground-level ozone)
VOC (Volcanic organic compounds) + NO2+03-Ã  PAN Ozone (Peroxyacetyl Nitrate Smog)
Atmospheric Brown Cloud (2.25 PM)
It is also known as Asiatic Brown Cloud.
It is made up of soot (Black Carbon) â€“ Unburnt carbon, sulfate and nitrate aerosols, carbonaceous aerosols.
Seen over south Asia, particularly over Gangetic plains.

Impact
Dimming effect- Decrease in the amount of sunlight received on the ground.
Impact on Hindukush- Himalayan Tibet Glaciers (melting)
Due to the warming of the upper atmosphere
Water flow in major rivers will be impacted
Impact on Monsoon/ Decline in rainfall over Gangetic Plain (weakening in pressure)
Decline in crop productivity due to decrease in photosynthesis.
Ozone Hole Formation (2.40 PM)
It is measured Dobson Unit- Concentration of Ozone molecule is measured.
Dobson unit- 0.01 mm thickness of ozone layer at STP.

Ozone Depletion
Chloro-fluoro carbon (CFC) â€“ refrigerant Freon
It is broken down into Chlorine Free Radical
Ozone hole formed in Antarctica is due to certain meteorological conditions such as:-
Very low temperature during Antarctica winter
Formation of stratospheric ice cloud
Trapping of CFCs in the polar vortex.
Global warming and climate change
Green House Effect- Trapping of outgoing Infrared Radiation (heat) by GHGs, CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, CFC, HFC, PFC, O3, Water Vapour.
Global warming- slow and gradual rise in the average temperature of Earthâ€™s surface due to greenhouse effect.
Climate Change- changes in climatic conditions viz., temperature, precipitation, etc caused due to global warming.

Abatement and control of air pollution (3.15 PM)

Devices/ equipment to control release of air pollutants

Air pollution control devices are a series of devices that work to prevent a variety of different pollutants, both gaseous and solid from entering the atmosphere primarily out of industrial chimneys.
These controlled can be separated into two broad categories- devices that control particulate matter and devices that control acidic gas emissions.
Devices that control PM are-
Electrostatic precipitator- it is a type of filter that uses static electricity to remove soot and ash before they exit to the atmosphere.
Soot particles are pulled out of the smoke by charging it and collecting it, leaving clean and hot air to escape the chimney.
Cyclone separators: it is a device that uses the principle of inertia to remove PM. Similar to a tornado; gases are moved to remove PM based on mass.
Fabric filters: Fabric filters are made of fabrics to collect and remove dust from the gases. Fabric is a woven cloth that would allow dust to be removed from the gas stream.
Devices used to control gaseous emissions are:
Scrubber: it is a type of system to remove sulphur di oxide gas from exhaust gases in industries and vehicles.
They are of two types: Wet Scrubbers and dry scrubbers
The main difference is of the type of materials used to remove the gases.
Incerination is used to convert volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions into CO2 and water through combustion.
It generally takes place in a specialized equipment known as afterburner which completely burn gases at high temperature.

2. Implementation of Bharat Stage (BS VI) standards:

Vehicular emissions and fuel quality.
To regulate vehicular pollution the GOI implemented BS VI standards from 1st April 2020.
CPCB sets the standards to regulate emissions from the vehicles.
BS VI vehicles have stricter permissible emission norms such as:
NOX emission: Less than 60 mg
PM limit: Less than 4.5 mg per km.
The above limits are for petrol
For diesel vehicles, the NOX limit is less than 80 mg.
PM limit is less than 4.5 mg per KM.
For diesel vehicles, the hydrocarbon+ NOX limit is 170 mg per KM.
Sulphur addition to the fuel reduced from 50 ppm to 10 ppm.
3. Air Quality Index and SAFAR
AQI- 8 pollutants are there which are measured.
SAFAR- System for Air Quality Forecasting and Research

AQI


SAFAR

8 air pollutants (CO, NH3, NO2, SO2, O3, Pb, PM2.5, PM 10) under 6 categories (0-500 ppm)


12 air pollutants (AQI+ NO, Benzene, BC, PM1.0) plus weather parameters.

By CPCB (MOEFCC)


IITM, Pune and IMD New Delhi (MOES)

All major cities and towns


Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad (3-4 days in advance air quality forecast)
