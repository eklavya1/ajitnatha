(Refer to the handouts)
Insurgency in Assam was started in 1979 by ULFA(United Liberation Fron of Asam).
But the background of insurgency can be traced to the All Assam Student's Union(AASU) which was an anti-alien movement in the 1960s.
It was against the illegal immigrant movent.
Their main demand was that all the illegal immigrants and outsiders should be deported.
From 1979 to 1985 thee were violent incidents occurred in Assam mostly led by ULFA.
They argued that the demography of Assam was being inverted and they wanted sovereignty and separation of Assam from India.
In 1985 Assam Accord was signed between The Government of India, the State Government of Assam, and AASU.
Their major demand was that anyone who migrated to Assam between 1961 to 1971 would be provided with residency in Assam but without voting rights for 10 years.
But still their many demands remained unfulfilled.
Anyone who migrated to Assam Post 1971 was to be declared illegal and had to be deported.
Finally the Supreme Court of India ordered the central govt to conduct NRC and to find the number of illegal immigrants.
However the ULFA's influence and support from the public had declined.
But since the 1990s there is a rising demand for Bodoland as a separate state for the Bodos who are the largest ethnic group in Assam.
Bodo insurgency was also started by a student protest group All Bodo Student Union(ABSU).
