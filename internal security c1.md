## Linkages between development and extremism
Linkages between development and extremism: (13:36)

Development refers to improvement in life, infrastructure, improvement in living standards.
Development has a negative impact too, e.g. displacement of people due to dam construction,
Coal mining, etc. In tribal areas may impact their environment, etc.
At times development can be unbalanced.
Extremism is a negative term, hence we have to understand the negative connotations of development too.
Extremism: Rigid and radical ideology of promoting extreme political motives, often by violent means.

## Left-Wing Extremism
Left-Wing Extremism: (13:59)

The history of left, right division can be traced to the French Revolution.
Left ideology and Right-wing ideology were born.
With the advent of Karl Marx, the left-wing ideology seems to support Communism.
Karl Marx calls for revolution.
Further, in the era of Lenin, the rule of Tsar was termed exploitative and needs to be overthrown.
Hence, Russian Revolution happened, which inspired the revolutions the world over, including the ideals of Bhagat Singh, etc.
Further, Mao Zedong came up with Chinese Communism.
This gave birth to the ideology of Maoism.
In India, Charu Mazoomdar, instigated an armed revolution in India, denouncing democracy.
Charu Mazumdar opined that peasants of West Bengal were exploited by the landlords, etc.
This movement was initiated in the Naxalbari District of Darjeeling, to replace the government with a communist system.
He called for revolution through Barrels of the Guns, which started in the summer of 1967.
In 2006, Dr. Manmohan Singh said that the biggest security challenge that India is facing is Naxalism, not the Kashmir issue.
In 2010, in Dantewada, 76 CRPF personnel were killed by the Naxals.
    2013: 25 leaders of the Indian National Congress were killed by the Naxals.

## Naxalism
Naxalism: (14:33)

Naxalism or Left Wing Extremism as a movement originated in the Naxalbari Area of Darjeeling District. 
It was a movement that aimed at the overthrow of the exploitative zamindars and moneylenders. 
LWE is inspired by Left Wing ideology and views of personalities such as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong.
Even though the Naxalbari Movement was brought under control, within a few months, it ignited the imagination of communist revolutionaries, to replicate the same in other parts of the country. 
It primarily started as an agrarian movement, but today, it has degenerated into a law and order problem.
The area, affected by Naxal violence is often termed as the ‘Red Corridor’.
Former Rural Development Minister, Dr. Jairam Ramesh mentioned that the Red Corridor extends from Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh) to Pashupati (Nepal).
The objective of the Naxalites is to overthrow the Indian State and establish a communist state in India.
This movement that started from one district in 1967, gradually expanded its fangs, to more than 180 districts by the year 2009. 

Land related factors: 

Development induced displacement, e.g. dams, etc. 40% people displaced after independence are tribals.
Forced evictions, 
Alienation of land, etc.
Non-implementation of constitutional safeguards, such as Article 244, Scheduled areas, Tribes Advisory Councils (TAC), etc. have not been properly implemented.

## Vacuum of governance
Vacuum of governance: (15:30)

Poor implementation of Schemes and programs.
There are also vested interests, the political interests of the people in Naxalism.
Naxalism has a vested interest in keeping these areas as poor.
There had been overt and covert support to Naxalism by China.
At least 40 Maoists of India received their training in Nepal.
In form of nexus between corrupt officials and Naxalites, the vacuum exists.
Socio-economic backwardness is also a reason for Naxalism.

## Evolution of Naxalism in India
Evolution of Naxalism in India: (15:57)

Phase I was 1967-1971 (started from Naxalbari, spread to Odisha, Bihar, etc.)
Largely the movement was around agrarian issues.
Mostly in rural areas and some support from urban areas.
The death of Charu Mazumdar culminated in the first phase of Naxalism.
Second phase: 1980s-2004.
Gradual expansion of Naxalism took place.
Two major centers were: Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.
Bengal was out of the focus during 2nd phase.
Expansion of Naxalism in Maharashtra, Karnataka, etc.
After the 1990s the Naxalism further expanded, due to privatization, mining licensing, etc.
More industries were allowed to mine in the tribal areas, etc.
Third Phase: 2004 onwards.
This was the phase of rapid expansion of Naxalism and violence.
CPI (Maoist) was formed due to the Maoist Communist Center of Bihar and PWG of Andhra Pradesh.
Naxalism in post-2010 era, Naxalism has been limited to fewer areas in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, etc.
