portuguese writer & portuguese india officer between 1500 & 1516â€”1517.
he was posted as a [[scrivener]] in cannanore factory & occasionally served as an interpreter of local language (malayalam).
his book of duarte barbosa (livro de duarte barbosa) is one of earliest examples of portuguese travel literature.
he has given a brief description of government & people of vijayanagar empire.
after his arrival in goa with 1st portuguese fleet in [[1501]] , barbosa made joumey to vijayanagara soon after.
his account mentions king of narsyngua, who is probably vira narasimha muva.
his writings give a detailed account of layout, inhabitants, nature of trade conducted in vijayanagara, size of king's army at time & more.
barbosa account of city's location & layout are quite accurate to what we know today from archaeological findings.
urban core is built on a flat plain surrounded by boulder hills, fortifications fill gaps & river tungabhadra flowing provides natural defence along entire northern stretch of city.
