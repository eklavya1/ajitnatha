in this case, [[supreme court]] laid down the doctrine of harmonious construction. the court was responding to an issue related to the 42nd amendment act where the amendment had given unlimited powers to the parliament to make laws for implementing all the [[directive principles of state policy]] & no such law shall be deemed to be unconstitutional simply because it violated article 14,19 or 31

the court held that the indian [[constitution]] is founded on the bedrock of balance b/w the [[fundamental rights]] & the dpsps. to give absolute primacy to one over the other would result in disturbing this delicate balance given in the constitution

the court also held that balance b/w [[Part 3]] & [[part4]] is the basic structure of the constitution. therefore maximum leverage must be given to a law that tries to enforce dpsps even if it goes against some of the fundamental rights in the general interest of the society
