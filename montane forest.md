Montane ecosystems are found on the slopes of mountains. The alpine climate in these regions strongly affects the ecosystem because temperatures fall as elevation increases, causing the ecosystem to stratify. This stratification is a crucial factor in shaping plant community, biodiversity, metabolic processes and ecosystem dynamics for montane ecosystems. Dense montane forests are common at moderate elevations, due to moderate temperatures and high rainfall. At higher elevations, the climate is harsher, with lower temperatures and higher winds, preventing the growth of trees and causing the plant community to transition to montane grasslands, shrublands or alpine tundra. Due to the unique climate conditions of montane ecosystems, they contain increased numbers of endemic species. Montane ecosystems also exhibit variation in ecosystem services, which include carbon storage and water supply.

in mountainous areas, decrease in temperature with increase in altitude leads to formation of montane forests. 
montane forests consist of 2 types of vegetation:
wet temperate type of forest is found b b/w height of 1000 & 2000 meters, with evergreen broad-leaf trees such as oaks & chestnuts.
temperate forests b b/w height of 1500 & 3000 meters, with coniferous trees like pine, deodar, silver fir, spruce, & cedar.
common animals found in these forests are kashmir stag, spotted dear, wild sheep, jackrabbit, tibetan antilope, yak, snow leopard, squirrels, shaggy horn wild ibex, bear & rare red panda, sheep, & goats with thick hair.
these forests cover mostly southern slopes of himalayas, places having high altitude in southern portion of western ghats range in karnataka, kerala, & tamil nadu, at elevations over 1000 meters & north-east india.
