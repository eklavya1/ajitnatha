- provisions relating to disqualification of the members of parliament and state legislatures on the ground of defection.
- this schedule was added by the [[52 caa]] of [[1985]].

- [[a102 disqualification s for membership]] [[a191]]

- it lays down the process by which legislators may be disqualified on grounds of defection by the presiding officer of a legislature based on a petition by any other member of the house.

- a legislator is deemed to have defected if he either voluntarily gives up the membership of his party or disobeys the directives of the party leadership on a vote (voting against the direction of the whip in the house)

- this implies that a legislator defying (abstaining or voting against) the party whip on any issue can lose his membership of the house. the law applies to both parliament and state assemblies.

- the constitution lays down that a person shall be disqualified from being a member of parliament if he is so disqualified on the ground of defection under the provisions of the tenth schedule. a member incurs disqualification under the defection law -

- o if he voluntarily gives up the membership of the political party on whose ticket he is elected to the house;
- o if he votes or abstains from voting in the house contrary to any direction given by his political party;
- o if any independently elected member joins any political party;
- o if any nominated member joins any political party after the expiry of six months.

- he has been convicted for any offence resulting in imprisonment for two or more years. this criterion for disqualification is mentioned in the [[representation of people act 1951]], not under the tenth schedule of the [[constitution]] of [[india]].
