Investiture (from the Latin preposition in and  verb vestire, "dress" from vestis "robe"), is the formal installation or ceremony in which a person is given the authority and regalia of a high office.

Investiture can include formal dress and adornment such as robes of state or headdress, or other regalia such as a throne or seat of office. An investiture is also often part of a coronation rite or enthronement. It was prevalent in the Middle Ages.
