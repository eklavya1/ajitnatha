# summary

BASIC INTRODUCTION
(1:00pm)

Maximum 1-3 questions are expected from the physics and chemistry section in Prelims.
Books resources suggested by the faculty: NCERT (6-10) along with the class notes.
Supplement it with All India Test Series and Current Affairs.

# Waves
(1:15 pm)
Wave is a disturbance in any medium and is represented by a sine or cosine curve.
Wavelength is the distance between two identical points in a waveform. In other words, it is the distance after which the wave repeats itself.
Frequency is the number of occurrences of an event per unit time.
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other.
# Light
(1:26pm)
Light has dual nature.
Light as a wave - Youngâ€™s double-slit experiment
In Youngâ€™s double-slit experiment, the light was deduced as a wave.
The wave nature of light helps us in understanding phenomenon like refraction, light as an energy carrier, etc.
Light as a particle - Einsteinâ€™s photoelectric effect
Einstein in his photoelectric effect experiment proved light as a particle
In this experiment when the light of a specific frequency was able to eject electrons out of the metal surface.
Einstein held that light is a packet of photons. And anyone of the photon must have collided with anyone of the electron to eject it out of the metal surface.
For this particular experiment, Einstein was awarded the Noble Prize.
The particle nature of light helps us in understanding phenomenon like reflection, traveling of light in a straight line.
# Electromagnetic Spectrum
(1:49pm)
Gamma Ray XRay Ultraviolet ray VIBGYOR Infra-Red wave Microwave  Radio wave
VIBGYOR (Visible spectrum or white light)
Particle nature is more dominant till ultraviolet (High energy radiation, ionizing radiation, harmful to humans))
Wave nature is more dominant from Infrared wave (low energy radiation, non-ionizing radiation, wavelength increases)
## Wave and their application:
Radio waves: radio and television communication, Bluetooth, wifi, submarine communication
Microwaves: mobile phone communication, Microwave ovens, Radar
Microwaves are having a great affinity towards water molecules. When they interact with water molecules they transfer their energy to water molecules. In the process, the water molecules get evaporated.
Infrared wave: TV remote, the heat of the sun is coming as infrared, infrared cameras, they are a carrier of heat
Ultraviolet: It can kill micro-organisms like bacteria and viruses, It synthesizes vitamin D in the body.
X-ray: to check bone deformations, in the airport and metro security scanners.
Gamma-ray: sterilization of medical equipment, cancer therapy, etc.
## Ray optics
(2:13pm)
### Reflection
It is a phenomenon in which light or heat waves return to the same medium after falling on a surface. 
It means the medium remains the same.
### Refraction
When the light changes the medium, it changes its path.
Rare to denser - light bends towards normal and speed decreases.
Denser to rarer - light bends away from the normal and speed increases.
During refraction, there is no change in the frequency of the wave but the wavelength and speed change.
### Dispersion
When white light passes through a prism, it splits into 7 individual colors. 
This happens because different colors have different speeds through any medium.
# Scattering of light
( 2:35 pm)
- Electrons revolve around the nucleus.
- Electrons have a great affinity towards the light. 
- They often absorb light and get excited. 
- In an excited state, they change their orbit. 
- After some time they return to their original orbit. 
- In this return journey, they emit light of various frequencies.
# Rayleigh scattering
- It involves the interaction of electromagnetic waves with particles whose size is smaller when compared to the wavelength of electromagnetic waves.
- It is elastic scattering where the incident and scattered photon share the same frequency.
- The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh's scattering.
# Raman Scattering
- It is scattering from an atom or molecule. 
- This happens because of excited electrons. It is inelastic scattering. 
- It helps in the understanding of the structure of atoms etc. 
# Total Internal reflection
The light should come from a denser to a rarer medium.
The angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle.
The critical angle is the angle on incidence at which refracted ray coincides with the medium interface.
In Optical fiber light moves in the denser medium-core. 
The outer layer is clad which has a lesser density. 
Due to total internal reflection, there is no loss of signal.
# Optical Illusions
## Mirage
It happens in hot places. 
It is an optical illusion where the object appears to be inverted.
Refraction and Total internal reflection are the responsible phenomena.
## Looming
It is an optical illusion happening in a colder climate. 
The object is erect and appears to be suspended in the air.
Refraction and Total internal reflection are the responsible phenomena.
## Rainbow
(3:21pm)
Three phenomena are responsible for rainbow formation.
Dispersion, Total internal reflection, and refraction.
Sometimes in nature, we may find a secondary rainbow where the outer circle is violet and the inner circle is red.
It is rarer than the primary rainbow and comparatively more blurry.
It happens if more than two total internal reflections happen.
## Twinkling of stars
(3:28 pm)
Multiple air pockets are present between Earth and stars due to which multiple reflections take place through all these air pockets.
Hence, the line of sight is adjusting itself every second because of which our eye is unable to locate the exact position of stars and they appear to be twinkling.
A distant star twinkles more than a nearby star.

Why we are not able to see violet( why the sky is blue and not violet) (3:33 pm)

Retina - Where an image is formed
Cones(Daylight vision); Recognition of colour-Red,Blue,Green
Rods-Responsible for dim light vision

Circumstances

Normal-

Particle suspended in air- Dust particles
Scattered spectrum- V,I,B
Colour of the sky- Blue as human eyes are sensitive to blue color

### Light Storm
Particle suspended in air- small water droplets
Scattered spectrum- V, I
Colour of the sky- V+I

### Heavy storm
Particle suspended in air-Heavy water droplets + salt particles
Scattered spectrum-violet
Colour of the sky- violet
Heavy storm+ light storm in higher latitudes and coastal areas(will not be seen in Indian latitudes)
# Colour of the sun at dusk and dawn
( 3:48 pm)
- At Dusk and dawn (morning or evening) - the sun appears to be at Horizon
- At Noon - the sun is overhead - apparent distance traveled by light is the least. Scattering of light is the least.
- Sun and the nearby sky appear to be white.
- When the sun is at the horizon- it appears to be red because at this point apparent distance traveled by light is maximum.
- Lower wavelengths like Blue, etc scatter a lot because of which eyes are unable to recognize them. Whereas, higher wavelengths like Red, orange, etc Scattered to a limit that eyes can recognize them. That is why the sun or nearby sky appears to be Red/orange.
- We are able to see the sun 2 minutes before sunrise and 2 minutes after sunset this is because of refraction.
- At the horizon, the sun appears to be slightly bigger than normal.

NOTES-
Optical fiber works on the principle of Total Internal Reflection
Diffusion of light in the atmosphere takes place due to dust particles.
- optical Illusion- the size of the sun at dusk, the color of the sun at dawn, Twinkle of stars (Asked in UPSC 2013)
- Rainbow is produced when sunlight falls on drops of rain. Which of the following physical phenomenon are responsible for this- (Asked in UPSC 2013)

- TOPIC FOR THE NEXT CLASS-WILL COVER MIRRORS AND LENSES; DEFECTS OF VISION; ELECTRIC CURRENT
