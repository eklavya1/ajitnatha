	- angle, θ
	- θ = 30H - 11/2 M #todo 
		- H -  hour
		- M - minute
### diff type of question / unusual
approach
when finding minute, formula is
M = 12/11 (5H ± θ/6) #todo 
	- at what time b/w 6 & 7 O clock will the minute & the hour clock will coincide
		- coincide means θ = 0
		- since base if from 6 so H - 6
	- if the θ is non-zero then you will get 2 answers, one from the ± plus and one from minus, see which one is appropriate by consulting the MCQ options
		_- whenever you get a negative value in (5H ± θ/6) add 60 to it_

## clock hand overtaking another hand
some factual data to remember
![[Pasted image 20211127220701.png]]
- overtaking / coincide
- {  (65 5/11 - given interval)/given interval  } x time duration = gain/loose
	- if answer is +ve = gain otherwise loose
- note
	- 1 day = 1440 min

alternatively just remember these 3 values (only they will come in csat)

## correct / incorrect time duration
correct duration = (rate of CC/ rate of IC) x incorr. duration
