## glossary

- Academic realism or academic art
- A style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies or universities. In India, it arrived under the aegis of Colonialism, when art academies were established in Calcutta (now, Kolkata), Madras (now, Chennai) and Lahore by the middle of the nineteenth century.
 
- Abstraction and abstract art
- The process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics. Abstract artists exaggerate or simplify forms suggested by the world around them. This form of art is identified with modernism but has existed before it.
   
- Art critic
- A person, who specialises in evaluating and critiquing art, art practice and production. The reviews are usually, published in newspapers, magazines, books on websites.

- Avant garde
- Meaning ‘advance guard’ or ‘vanguard’, it refers to people or works that are experimental or innovative, particularly, with respect to art, culture, and politics. It stands for art that does not necessarily accept existing norms of aesthetic or political theories. In India, it has been associated with cultural practices of political radicals and liberal intellects.

- Bibliophile

- Colophon page

- Chiaroscuro
- The treatment of light and shade in a drawing or painting.

- Community art
- Art organised around a community situation. It is characterised by interaction or dialogue with the community. The term came into use in the late 1960s, when it grew as a movement in the United States, Canada, UK, Ireland and Australia. In India, artists like Navjot Altaf and K. P. Soman engaged with it around 2000. They have worked with local communities on social themes like exploitation, the rural–urban divide and caste disparities.

- connoisseur
- a person who has immense knowledge in arts, food or drinks and can appreciate the same.
