“I shall not now speak of the knowledge of the Hindus, … of their subtle
discoveries in the science of astronomy-discoveries even more ingenious
than those of the Greeks and Babylonians-of their rational system of
mathematics, or of their method of calculation which no words can praise
strongly enough—I mean the system using nine symbols. If these things
were known by the people who think that they alone have mastered the
sciences because they speak Greek they would perhaps be convinced,
though a little late in the day, that other folk, not only Greeks, but men of a
different tongue, know something as well as they.”
The Syrian astronomer-monk SEVERUS SEBOKHT ( writing A.D. 662).

## PREFACE
[Page vii]
THIS book has been written to interpret ancient Indian civilization, as Iunderstand it, to the ordinary Western reader who has little knowledge ofthe subject, but some interest in it. The three nations of the Indian Sub-continent, since the momentous daysof1947 when they gained completeindependence, have been playing an evergrowing part in the affairs of theworld, and there is perhaps room for a new outline of their ancient culture,to replace the many excellent works now out of print, and to further ourunderstanding of the civilization of these new states in the contemporaryworld.

As this book is intended for the general reader I have tried, as far aspossible, to leave nothing unexplained. And as I believe that civilization ismore than religion and art I have tried, however briefly, to cover all aspectsof Indian life and thought. Though primarily intended for Westerners I hopethat the book may be of some interest to Indian, Pakistani and Sinhalesereaders also, as the interpretation of a friendly mleccha, who has great loveand respect for the civilizations of their lands, and many friends among thedescendants of the people whose culture he studies. The work may also beof help to students who are embarking on a course of serious Indologicalstudy; for their benefit I have included detailed bibliographies andappendices. But, for the ordinary reader, the work is cumbersome enough,and therefore I have not given references for every statement. I have tried toreduce Sanskrit terms to a minimum, but the reader without backgroundknowledge will find definitions of all Indian words used in the text in theindex, which also serves as a glossary.

Sanskrit, Prākrit and Pāli words are transliterated according to thestandard system at present used by Indologists; this, with its plethora ofdiacritic marks, may at first seem irritating, but it is the only sound methodof expressing the original spelling, and gives a clear idea of the correctpronunciation. Modern Indian proper names are generally given in the mostusual spelling1 with the addition of marks over the long vowels, to indicatetheir approximately correct pronunciation. I have tried to employconsistently the names and spellings officially adopted by the new states ofthe Sub-continent (e.g. Banāras for Benares, Uttar Pradesh for UnitedProvinces, etc.,) and as these do not appear in pre-war atlases they areshown in the [Page viii] map of modern India in the endpaper. 2 Throughoutthis work the word “India” is of course used in its geographical sense, andincludes Pakistan. Though very inadequately, I have tried to include in thescope of this survey Ceylon, whose culture owed much to India, butdeveloped many individual features of its own.

The translations, except where specified, are my own. I lay no claim togreat literary merit for them, and have not been able to reproduce theuntranslatable incantation of the originals. In most cases they are not literaltranslations, since the character of Indian classical languages is so unlikethat of English that literal translations are at the best dull and at the worstpositively ludicrous. In places I have taken some liberty with the originals,in order to make their purport clearer to the Western reader, but in all cases Ihave tried to give an honest interpretation of the intentions of their authors,as I understand them.

In the course of writing this book I have asked the advice of several friends and colleagues, and have also received their encouragement and help in other respects. I must specially thank (in alphabetical order) Mr. F.

R. Allchin, Dr. A. A. Bake, Dr. L. D. Barnett (my respected teacher, whose Antiquities of India, written over forty years ago, has to some extent served as a model for this book), Professor J. Brough (who first suggested that I should write this book), Mrs. Devahuti, Professor A. T. Hatto, Mr. J. R. Marr (for translations on p. 464ff), Dr. A. K. Narain, Professor C. H.

Philips, Mr. P. Rawson, Mr. C. A. Rylands, and Dr. Arthur Waley (for translations on p. 477f). I would also thank the numerous institutions and individuals who have kindly allowed me to reproduce illustrations of which they hold the copyright, and whose names are recorded above each plate3; and the Librarian and Staff of the Library of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, for their courtsey and help. Finally, I am greatly indebted to my wife for much encouragement.

## PRONUNCIATION
[Page xxi]
MORE detailed notes on the Indian alphabet and its pronunciation are given in App. X, p. 506ff. The following is a rough guide for the general reader.

The vowels ā, ī, ū, e, ai, o, au are long, and have approximately the same pronunciation as in Italian, or as the vowels in the English words calm, machine, rule, prey, time, go and cow, respectively. A, i, u are short, and equivalent to the vowels in the English words cut, bit and bull. The reader should avoid the temptation to pronounce a as in English sat. Thus Sanskrit sama is pronounced as English summer. Ṛ is classed as a short vowel, and is pronounced as ri in rich.

The aspirated consonants th and ph must never be pronounced as in English thin and phial, but as in pothole and shepherd. C is pronounced as ch in church. Ś and ṣ are both generally pronounced as English sh in shape.

The distinction between the other sub-dotted “retroflex” consonants (ṭ , ṭ h, ḍ , ḍ h and ṇ) and the dentals, without dots, is not important to the general reader.

FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES
NOTES marked with *, †, ‡, are given at the bottom of the page. Those
marked with figures are references only, and are given with classified
bibliographies at the back of the book; they may be ignored by the reader
who does not intend to pursue the topic further.

INTRODUCTION: INDIA AND HER ANCIENT
CULTURE


## THE LAND OF INDIA
[Page 1]THE ancient civilization of India grew up in a sharply demarcated sub-continent bounded on the north by the world’s largest mountain range-thechain of the Himalayas, which, with its extensions to east and west, dividesIndia from the rest of Asia and the world. The barrier, however, was at notime an insuperable one, and at all periods both settlers and traders havefound their way over the high and desolate passes into India, while Indianshave carried their commerce and culture beyond her frontiers by the sameroute. India’s isolation has never been complete, and the effect of themountain wall in developing her unique civilization has often beenoverrated.The importance of the mountains to India is not so much in the isolationwhich they give her, as in the fact that they are the source of her two greatrivers. The clouds drifting northwards and westwards in the rainy seasondischarge the last of their moisture on the high peaks, whence, fed by ever-melting snow, innumerable streams flow southward, to meet in the greatriver systems of the Indus and the Ganges. On their way they pass throughsmall and fertile plateaux, such as the valleys of Kashmīr and Nepal, todebouch on the great plain.

Of the two river systems, that of the Indus, now mainly in Pakistan, hadthe earliest civilization, and gave its name to India.1 The Fertile Plain of thePanjāb (“Five Rivers”), watered by the five great tributaries of the Indus-theJhelam, Chenāb, Rāvī, Beās and Satlaj-had a high culture over twothousand years before Christ, which spread down the lower course of theIndus as far as the sea. The lower Indus, in the Pakistan province of Sind,now passes through barren desert, though this was once a well watered andfertile land.

[Page 2] The basin of the Indus is divided from that of the Ganges by the Thar, or desert of Rājasthān, and by low hills. The watershed, to the north-west of Delhī, has been the scene of many bitter battles since at least 1000B.C. The western half of the Ganges plain, from the region around Delhī toPatnā, and including the Doāb, or the land between the Ganges and its great tributary river Jamnā, has always been the heart of India. Here, in the regiononce known as Áryāvarta, the land of the Áryans, her classical culture wasformed. Though generations of unscientific farming, deforestation, andother factors have now much reduced its fertility, it was once among themost productive lands in the world, and has supported a very largepopulation ever since it was brought under the plough. At its mouth inBengal the Ganges forms a large delta, which even in historical times hasgained appreciably on the sea; here it joins the river Brahmaputra, whichflows from Tibet by way of the Valley of Assam, the easternmost outpost ofHindu culture.

South of the great plain is a highland zone, rising to the chain of theVindhya mountains. These are by no means as impressive as the Himalayas,but have tended to form a barrier between the North, formerly calledHindustan, and the Peninsula, often known as the Deccan (meaning simply“South”), a term used sometimes for the whole peninsula, but more oftenfor its northern and central portions. Most of the Deccan is a dry and hillyplateau, bordered on either side by long ranges of hills, the Western andEastern Ghāts. Of these two ranges the western is the higher, and therefore most of the rivers of the Deccan, such as the Mahānadī, the Godāvarī, theKistnā or Krsnā, and the Kāverī, flow eastwards to the sea. Two large riversonly, the Narmadā and the Tāptī, flow westwards. Near their mouths theDeccan rivers pass through plains which are smaller than those of theGanges but almost as populous. The south-eastern part of the Peninsulaforms a larger plain, the Tamil country, the culture of which was onceindependent, and is not yet completely unified with that of the North. TheDravidian peoples of Southern India still speak languages in no way akin tothose of the North, and are of a different ethnic character (p 24f), thoughthere has been much intermixture between Northern and Southern types.

Geographically Ceylon is a continuation of India, the plain of the North resembling that of South India, and the mountains in the centre of the island kthe Western Ghāts.

From Kashmīr in the North to Cape Comorin in the South the sub- continent is about 2,000 miles long, and therefore its climate varies considerably. The Himalayan region has cold winters, with occasional frost and snow. In the northern plains the winter is cool, [Page 3] with wide variation of day and night temperature, whereas the hot season is almostintolerable. The temperature of the Deccan varies less with the season,though in the higher parts of the plateau nights are cool in winter. The TamilPlain is continuously hot, but its temperature never rises to that of thenorthern plains in summer.

The most important feature of the Indian climate is the monsoon, or “the Rains”. Except along the west coast and in parts of Ceylon rain rarely falls from October to May, when cultivation can only be carried on by carefully husbanding the water of rivers and streams, and raising a winter crop by irrigation. By the end of April growth has practically ceased. Thetemperature of the plains rises as high as 110 F. or over, and an intensely hotwind blows. Trees shed their leaves, grass is almost completely parched,wild animals often die in large numbers for want of water. Work is reducedto a minimum, and the world seems asleep.

Then clouds appear, high in the sky; in a few days they grow more numerous and darker, rolling up in banks from the sea. At last, in June, the rains come in great downpouring torrents, with much thunder and lightning.

The temperature quickly drops, and within a few days the world is greenand smiling again. Beasts, birds and insects reappear, the trees put on newleaves, and the earth is covered with fresh grass. The torrential rains, whichfall at intervals for a couple of months and then gradually die away, maketravel and all outdoor activity difficult, and often bring epidemics in theirwake; but, despite these hardships, to the Indian mind the coming of themonsoon corresponds to the coming of spring in Europe. For this reasonthunder and lightning, in Europe generally looked on as inauspicious, haveno terrors for the Indian, but are welcome signs of the goodness of heaven(p. 255).

It has often been said that the scale of natural phenomena in India, and her total dependence on the monsoon, have helped to form the character of her peoples. Even today major disasters, such as flood, famine and plague, are hard to check, and in older times their control was almost impossible.

Many other ancient civilizations, such as those of the Greeks, Romans andChinese, had to contend with hard winters, which encouraged sturdinessand resource. India, on the other hand, was blessed by a bounteous Nature,who demanded little of man in return for sustenance, but in her terribleanger could not be appeased by any human effort. Hence, it has beensuggested, the Indian character has tended to fatalism and quietism,accepting fortune and misfortune alike without complaint.

How far this judgement is a fair one is very dubious. Though an elementof quietism certainly existed in the ancient Indian attitude [Page 4] to life,as it does in India today, it was never approved by moralists. The greatachievements of ancient India and Ceylon-their immense irrigation worksand splendid temples, and the long campaigns of their armies-do notsuggest a devitalized people. If the climate had any effect on the Indiancharacter it was, we believe, to develop a love of ease and comfort, anaddiction to the simple pleasures and luxuries so freely given by Nature-atendency to which the impulse to self-denial and asceticism on the onehand, and occasional strenuous effort on the other, were natural reactions.

## THE DISCOVERY OF ANCIENT INDIA
The ancient civilization of India differs from those of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece, in that its traditions have been preserved without a break down to the present day. Until the advent of the archæologist, the peasant of Egypt or Iraq had no knowledge of the culture of his forefathers, and it is doubtful whether his Greek counterpart had any but the vaguest ideas about the glory of Periclean Athens. In each case there had been analmost complete break with the past. On the other hand, the earliestEuropeans to visit India found a culture fully conscious of its ownantiquity-a culture which indeed exaggerated that antiquity, and claimed notto have fundamentally changed for many thousands of years. To this daylegends known to the humblest Indian recall the names of shadowychieftains who lived nearly a thousand years before Christ, and theorthodox brāhman in his daily worship repeats hymns composed evenearlier. India and China have, in fact, the oldest continuous culturaltraditions in the world.

Until the last half of the 18th century Europeans made no real attempt to
study India’s ancient past, and her early history was known only from briefpassages in the works of Greek and Latin authors. A few devotedmissionaries in the Peninsula gained a deep understanding of contemporaryIndian life, and a brilliant mastery of the vernaculars, but they made no realattempt to understand the historical background of the culture of the peopleamong whom they worked. They accepted that culture at its face value, asvery ancient and unchanging, and their only studies of India’s past were inthe nature of speculations linking the Indians with the descendants of Noahand the vanished empires of the Bible.

Meanwhile a few Jesuits succeeded in mastering Sanskrit, the classicallanguage of India. One of them, Father Hanxleden, who worked in Malabarfrom 1699 to 1732, compiled the first Sanskrit grammar in a Europeantongue, which remained in manuscript, but [Page 5] was used by hissuccessors. Another, Father Coeurdoux, in 1767, was probably the firststudent to recognise the kinship of Sanskrit and the languages of Europe,and suggested that the brāhmans of India were descended from one of thesons of Japhet, whose brothers migrated to the West. Yet the Jesuits, for alltheir studies, gained no real understanding of India’s past: the foundationsof Indology were laid independently, in another part of India, and by otherhands.

In the year 1783 one of the most brilliant men of the 18th century, Sir William Jones (1746–94) (pl. IVa), came to Calcutta as a judge of the Supreme Court, under the governor-generalship of Warren Hastings, who himself had deep sympathy with both Muslim and Hindu culture. Jones wasa linguistic genius, who had already learnt all the more important languagesof Europe as well as Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, and had evenobtained a smattering of Chinese with the aid of the very inadequatematerial available in Europe at the time. Before coming to India he hadrecognized the relationship of European languages to Persian, and hadrejected the orthodox view of the 18th century, that all these tongues werederived from Hebrew, which had been garbled at the Tower of Babel. Inplace of this dogma Jones suggested that Persian and the Europeanlanguages were derived from a common ancestor which was not Hebrew.

Of the little band of Englishmen who administered Bengal for the Honourable East India Company only one, Charles Wilkins (1749–1836), had managed to learn Sanskrit. With the aid of Wilkins and friendly Bengālīpandits Jones began to learn the language. On the first day of 1784 theAsiatic Society of Bengal was founded, on Jones’ initiative, and withhimself as president. In the journal of this society, Asiatic Researches, thefirst real steps in revealing India’s past were taken. In November 1784 thefirst direct translation of a Sanskrit work into English, Wilkins’s BhagavadGītā, was completed. This Wilkins followed in 1787 with a translation ofthe Hitopadeśa. In 1789 Jones translated Kālidāsa’s Śakuntalā, which wentinto five English editions in less than twenty years; this he followed bytranslations of the Gīta Govinda (1792), and the lawbook of Manu(published posthumously in 1794 under the title Institutes of Hindoo Law).

Several less important translations appeared in successive issues of Asiatic Researches.

Jones and Wilkins were truly the fathers of Indology. They were followed in Calcutta by Henry Colebrooke (1765–1837) and Horace Hayman Wilson (1789–1860). To the works of these pioneers must be added that of the Frenchman Anquetil-Duperron, a Persian scholar who, in 1786, published a translation of four Upanisads from [Page 6] a 17th-century Persian version- the translation of the whole manuscript, containing 50 Upanisads, appearing in 1801.

Interest in Sanskrit literature began to grow in Europe as a result of these translations. In 1795 the government of the French Republic founded the École des Langues Orientales Vivantes, and there Alexander Hamilton (1762–1824), one of the founding members of the Asiatic Society ofBengal, held prisoner on parole in France at the end of the Peace of Amiensin 1803, became the first person to teach Sanskrit in Europe. It was fromHamilton that Friedrich Schlegel, the first German Sanskritist, learnt thelanguage. The first university chair of Sanskrit was founded at the Collegede France in 1814, and held by Léonard de Chézy, while from 1818onwards the larger German universities set up professorships. Sanskrit wasfirst taught in England in 1805 at the training college of the East IndiaCompany at Hertford. The earliest English chair was the BodenProfessorship at Oxford, first filled in 1832, when it was conferred upon H.

H. Wilson, who had been an important member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Chairs were afterwards founded at London, Cambridge and Edinburgh, and at several other universities of Europe and America.

In 1816, Franz Bopp (1791–1867), a Bavarian, on the basis of the hints of Sir William Jones, succeeded in very tentatively reconstructing the common ancestor of Sanskrit and the classical languages of Europe, and comparative philology became an independent science. In 1821, the French Société Asiatique was founded in Paris, followed two years later by the Royal Asiatic Society in London. From these beginnings the work of the editing and study of ancient Indian literature went on apace throughout the 19th century. Probably the greatest achievement of Indological scholarshipin 19th-century Europe was the enormous Sanskrit-German dictionarygenerally known as the St. Petersburg Lexicon, produced by the Germanscholars Otto Böhtlingk and Rudolf Roth, and published in parts by theRussian Imperial Academy of Sciences from 1852 to 1875. England’sgreatest contributions to Sanskrit studies were the splendid edition of theṚ g Veda, and the great series of authoritative annotated translations, SacredBooks of the East. Both of these works were edited by the great GermanSanskritist Friedrich Max Müller (1823–1900), who spent most of hisworking life as Professor of Comparative Philology at Oxford.

Meanwhile the study of ancient Indian culture was proceeding in another direction. The first work of the Asiatic Society of Bengal had been almost entirely literary and linguistic, and most of the 19th century Indologists were primarily scholars, working on written [Page 7] records. Early in the 19th century, however, the Bengal Society began to turn some of itsattention to the material remains of India’s past, as the East IndiaCompany’s surveyors brought back many reports of temples, caves andshrines, together with early coins and copies of inscriptions in long-deadscripts. By working backwards from the current scripts the older ones weregradually deciphered, until in 1837 a gifted amateur, James Prinsep, anofficial of the Calcutta Mint and Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,interpreted for earliest Brāhmī script and was able to read the edicts of thegreat emperor Aśoka. Among Prinsep’s colleagues in the work ofdecipherment was a young officer of the Royal Engineers, AlexanderCunningham (pl. IV b), the father of Indian archaeology. From his arrival inIndia in 1831 Cunningham devoted every minute he could spare from hismilitary duties to the study of the material remains of ancient India, until, in1862, the Indian government established the post of ArchæologicalSurveyor, to which he was appointed. Until his retirement in 1885 hedevoted himself to the unravelling of India’s past with complete single-heartedness. Though he made no startling discoveries, and though histechnique was, by modern Archæological standards, crude and primitive,there is no doubt that, after Sir William Jones, Indology owes more toGeneral Sir Alexander Cunningham than to any other worker in the field.

Cunningham was assisted by several other pioneers, and though at the end of the 19th century the activities of the Archæological Survey almost ceased, owing to niggardly government grants, by 1900 many ancient buildings had been surveyed, and many inscriptions read and translated.

It was only in the 20th century that Archæological excavation on a largescale began in India. Thanks to the personal interest of the Viceroy, LordCurzon, in 1901 the Archæological Survey was reformed and enlarged, anda young archæologist, John (later Sir John) Marshall (pl. IV d), appointed asDirector General. For a country of the size of India the ArchæologicalDepartment was still lamentably small and poor, but Marshall was able toemploy a number of expert assistants, and had funds for excavation on ascale more extensive than anything previously attempted. For the first timetraces of the ancient cities of India began to come to light— archæology, asdistinct from the surveying and conservation of ancient monuments, hadbegun in real earnest. The greatest triumph of the Archæological Survey ofIndia under Sir John Marshall’s directorship was undoubtedly the discoveryof the Indus civilization. The first relics of India’s oldest cities were noticedby Cunningham, who found strange unidentified seals in the neighbourhoodof [Page 8] Harappā in the Panjāb. In 1922 an Indian officer of theArchæological Survey, R. D. Banerjī, found further seals at Mohenjo Daroin Sind, and recognized that they were the remains of a pre-Áryancivilization of great antiquity. Under Sir John Marshall’s direction the siteswere systematically excavated from 1924 until his retirement in 1931.

Digging was interrupted by financial retrenchment, and by the Second World War; but further important discoveries were made at Harappā during the brief directorship of Sir R. E. Mortimer Wheeler just after the war, though the sites are still by no means fully cleared.

Much has yet to be done. Many mounds as yet unexcavated may throw floods of light on the dark places of India’s past: unpublished manuscripts of great importance may yet lie mouldering in out-of-the-way libraries.

India, Pākistān and Ceylon are poor countries, desperately in need of funds with which to raise the standard of living of their peoples; but with the resources available the archæological departments of all three countries are working to their fullest capacity to reveal the past.

Even in the last century, much valuable work was done by natives ofIndia, especially by such Sanskritists and epigraphists as Drs. Bhāū Dājī,Bhagavānlāl Indrājī, Rājendralāl Mitra, and the great Sir R. G. Bhandarkar(pl. IV c). Now the chief initiative in Indology comes from the Indiansthemselves. Indians are well on the way to completing the first criticaledition of the gigantic Mahābhārata, and have started work on theenormous Poona Sanskrit Dictionary, which, when complete, will probablybe the greatest work of lexicography the world has ever seen. The DirectorGeneral of the Archæological Department is now an Indian (Dr. A. Ghosh),and today the European Indologist cannot hope to be more than the helperand friendly critic of the Indian. In times like these, however, when Asia isreacting against a century and a half of European domination, and a newculture, which will contain elements of East and West in firm synthesis, isin the process of birth, the European student still has a useful role to play inIndology.

## THE GLORY OF ANCIENT INDIA
At most periods of her history India, though a cultural unit, has been torn by internecine war. In statecraft her rulers were cunning and unscrupulous. Famine, flood and plague visited her from time to time, and killed millionsof her people. Inequality of birth was given religious sanction, and the lot ofthe humble was generally hard. Yet our overall impression is that in noother part of the [Page 9] ancient world were the relations of man and man,and of man and the state, so fair and humane. In no other early civilizationwere slaves so few in number, and in no other ancient lawbook are theirrights so well protected as in the Arthaśāstra (p. 152f). No other ancientlawgiver proclaimed such noble ideals of fair play in battle as did Manu (p.

126). In all her history of warfare Hindu India has few tales to tell of cities put to the sword or of the massacre of noncombatants. The ghastly sadism of the kings of Assyria, who flayed their captives alive, is completelywithout parallel in ancient India. There was sporadic cruelty and oppressionno doubt, but, in comparison with conditions in other early cultures, it wasmild. To us the most striking feature of ancient Indian civilization is itshumanity.

Some 19th-century missionaries, armed with passages from Hindu andBuddhist scriptures, often taken out of their context, and with tales offamine, disease, and the evils of the Hindu caste and family system, havehelped to propagate the widespread fallacy that India is a land of lethargicgloom. The traveller landing at Bombay has only to watch the rush-hourcrowds, and to compare them mentally with those of London, to realize thatthe Indian character is neither lethargic nor unhappy. This conclusion isborne out by a general acquaintance with the remains of India’s past. Oursecond general impression of ancient India is that her people enjoyed life,passionately delighting both in the things of the senses and the things of thespirit.

The European student who concentrates on religious texts of a certain type may well gain the impression that ancient India was a land of “life-negating” 2 ascetics, imposing their gloomy and sterile ideas upon thetrusting millions who were their lay followers. The fallacy of thisimpression is quite evident from the secular literature, sculpture andpainting of the time. The average Indian, though he might pay lip-service tothe ascetic and respect his ideals, did not find life a vale of tears from whichto escape at all costs; rather he was willing to accept the world as he foundit, and to extract what happiness he could from it. Dandin’s description ofthe joys of a simple meal served in a comparatively poor home (p.,44ff) isprobably more typical of ancient Indian everyday life than are theUpanisads. India was a cheerful land, whose people, each finding a niche ina complex and slowly evolving social system, reached a higher level ofkindliness and gentleness in their mutual relationships than any other nationof antiquity. For this, as well as for her great achievements in religion,literature, art and mathematics, one European student at least would recordhis admiration of her ancient culture.

1 The Indians knew this river as Sindhu, and the Persians, who founddifficulty in pronouncing an initial s, called it Hindu. From Persia the wordpassed to Greece, where the whole of India became known by the name ofthe western river. The ancient Indians knew their sub-continent asJambudvipa (the continent of the jambu tree) or Bharatavar.sa (the Land ofthe sons of Bharata, a legendary emperor) (p. 488f). The latter name hasbeen in part revived by the present Indian government. With the Musliminvasion the Persian name returnedintheformHindustan, and those of itsinhabitants who followed the old religion became known as Hinduls.

2 This term, as applied to Indian religion, thought and culture, is that ofthe great Dr. Albert Schweitzer (Indian Thought and its Development, passim).

PREHISTORY: THE HARAPPĀ CULTURE
AND THE ARYANS


## PRIMITIVE MAN IN INDIA
[Page 10]LIKE prehistoric Europe, Northern India experienced ice ages, and it wasafter the second of these, in the Second Interglacial Period, from about400,000 to 200,000 B.C., that man first left surviving traces in India. Theseare the palæolithic pebble tools of the Soan Culture, so called from the littleriver in the Panjāb where they have been found in large numbers. In typethey resemble tools widely distributed all over the Old World, from Englandto Africa and China. In India no human remains have been found inassociation with the tools, but elsewhere such industries have been shownto be the work of primitive anthropoid types, such as the Pithecanthropus ofJava and China.

In the South there existed another prehistoric stone industry, which is notconclusively dated, but which may have been the approximatecontemporary of that of the Soan Valley. The men of this culture made coretools, especially fine hand axes, formed by striking off flakes from a largepebble, and they evidently had muchbettercommandovertheirmaterialthantheSoan men. This Madras Industry, as it is called by thearchæologists, has affinities with similar core tool industries in Africa,western Europe, and southern England, where it hasbeenfound inassociation with a more advanced type of man—a true Homo sapiens.The Ganges Valley is one of the newest parts of the earth’s surface, andmany geologists believe that at the time of these two stone-age industriesmuch of it was still a shallow sea; but there may have been contact betweenthem by way of Rajasthan, for the tools of one culture have been foundsporadically in the region of the other. The men who used these palæolithsmust have lived in India for many millennia. Who they were and whatbecame of them we do not know. Their blood may still flow in theinhabitants of modern India, but if the pebble industry of Soan was thework of proto-human anthropoids they must have vanished long ago, likethe Neanderthal men in Europe and the Pithecanthropi of the Far East.

Homo sapiens continued in India, his skill and technical equipmentimperceptibly improving down the ages. He learnt to fashion microliths,[Page 11] tiny and delicate stone arrowheads and other implements, whichhave been found in many parts of India, from the N.–W. Frontier to theextreme south. Similar microlithic industries occur in many parts of theNear East and Africa, but their chronological relationship with themicrolithic industry of India is not clear. In parts of the Deccan microlithsare often found together with polished stone axes, and it would seem that inthe remoter parts of the Peninsula their use was only fully replaced by thatof iron tools around the beginning of the Christian age. 1


## THE FIRST VILLAGES
Palæolithic man was a hunter and food gatherer, and lived in very small communities, which were usually nomadic. In the course of time he learnt to kindle fire, to protect his body from the weather with skin, bark or leaves, and to tame the wild dog which lurked round his campfire. In India, as all over the world, men lived thus for many millennia.

Then, very recently in the perspective of geological time, great changes took place in man’s way of living. Certainly not much earlier than 10,000B.C., and perhaps as late as 6000 B.C., man developed what Professor GordonChilde calls “an aggressive attitude to his environment”. He learnt how togrow food crops, he tamed domestic animals, he made pots, and he wovegarments. Before discovering the use of metal, he taught himself to makewell-polished stone implements far in advance of those of the palæolithicage. Such implements have been found all over India, but mostly in theNorth-West and in the Deccan, and usually on or near the surface. In muchof the country neolithic culture survived long, and many of the wilder hilltribes of the present day have only recently emerged from this stage.

Developed agriculture and permanent villages probably began in the 5th millennium B.C., in the Middle East. In India the earliest remains of a settled culture are of little agricultural villages in Balūchistān and lower Sind,perhaps dating from the end of the 4th millennium.

Classical writers show that when, in 326 B.C., Alexander of Macedoncrossed the Indus, the climate of N.–W. India was much as it is today,though perhaps a little moister. The river valleys were fertile and wellwooded, though the coastal strip to the west of the Indus, now called theMakrān, and much of Balūchistān, were already dry and desolate. But in3000 B.C. the climate was very different. The whole Indus region was wellforested, providing fuel to burn [Page 12] bricks and food for wildelephants and rhinoceros, and Balūchistān, now almost a waterless desert,was rich in rivers. This region supported many villages of agriculturists,who had settled in the upland valleys of Balūchistān and in the then fertileplain of the Makrān and the lower Indus.



Fig. i.—Some Prehistoric Sites of N.–W. India
These people belonged to several cultures, primarily distinguished by different types of painted pottery. Each culture had distinctive features of its own, but all were of the same generic pattern as those of the Middle East.

Though their settlements were small, rarely more than a few acres in extent,their material standards were comparatively high. The villagers dwelt incomfortable houses of mud brick with lower courses of stone, and madegood pottery, which they painted with pleasant patterns. They knew the useof metal, for a few copper implements have been discovered in the sites.

[Page 13]

The village cultures had varying customs, for the secluded valleys of the Brāhūī Hills and the comparative simplicity of the lives of inhabitants did not encourage very close contact. Thus the northern villages madepredominantly red pottery, and the southern buff; the people of the KullīCulture, in the Makrān, burnt their dead, while those of the Nāl Culture, inthe Brāhuī Hills, practised fractional burial, or the inhumation of the bonesafter partial disintegration by burning or exposure.

Their religion was of the type practised by other early agriculturalcommunities in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East, centringround fertility rites and the worship of a Mother Goddess. Figurines of theGoddess have been found in many sites, and in those of the Zhob Culture,to the north of Quetta, phallic emblems have also been found. In many ancient cultures the worship of the Mother [Page 14] Goddess wasassociated with that of the bull, and these were no exception. Bull figurineshave been discovered, and the bull forms a favourite motif for thedecoration of the pottery of Kullī and Rānā Ghundāī, one of the mostimportant of the Zhob sites.

The people of the Kullī culture excelled in making small boxes of soft stone, delicately engraved with linear patterns. Such boxes have beenoccasionally found in early Mesopotamian sites, and we may assume thatthey were exported by the Kullī people, perhaps filled with unguent orperfume of some kind. At Susa and elsewhere have been found a few piecesof painted pottery which are evidently imitated from the wares of the Kullīpeople, who obviously traded with the Middle East. Otherwise there is littleevidence of contact. No certainly identifiable Mesopotamian remains havebeen found in BalūichistĀn, and there is no trace of objects from the KullīCulture along the overland route. It seems that the Kullī people madecontact with the earliest Mesopotamian civilizations by sea.



## THE HARAPPĀ CITY CULTURE
In the early part of the 3rd millennium, civilization, in the sense of an organized system of government over a comparatively large area, developed nearly simultaneously in the river valleys of the Nile, Euphrates, and Indus.
We know a great deal about the civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, for they have left us written material which has been satisfactorily deciphered.

The Indus people, on the other hand, did not engrave long inscriptions on stone or place papyrus scrolls in the tombs of their dead; all that we know of their writing is derived from the brief inscriptions of their seals, and there is no Indian counterpart of the Rosetta Stone. Several brilliant efforts havebeen made to read the Indus seals, but none so far has succeeded. Hence ourknowledge of the Indus civilization is inadequate in many respects, and itmust be classed as prehistoric, for it has no history in the strict sense of theterm.

The civilization of the Indus is known to the archæologist as the Harappa Culture, from the modern name of the site of one of its two great cities, onthe left bank of the Rāvī, in the Panjāb. Mohenjo Daro, the second city, ison the right bank of the Indus, some 250 miles from its mouth. As well asthese two cities at least three small towns are known, and a large number ofvillage sites, from Rūbpar on the upper Satlaj to Rangpur in Kāthiāwār. The area covered by the Harappā Culture therefore extended for some 950 milesfrom north to south, and the pattern of its civilization was so uniform thateven the bricks were usually of the same size and shape from one [Page 15]end of it to the other. Outside this area the village cultures of Balūchistānseem to have continued much as before.

This great civilization owed little to the Middle East, and there is no reason to believe that it was formed by recent immigrants; the cities were built by people who had probably been in the Indus Valley for several centuries. The Harappā people were already Indians when they planned their cities, and they altered hardly at all for a thousand years. We cannot fix a precise date for the beginning of this civilization, but certain indications synchronize it roughly with the village cultures of Balūchistān. The site ofRana Ghundai produced a stratification which showed, in the third phase ofthe village’s history, a type of pottery with bold designs in black on a redbackground. From evidence discovered by Sir R. Mortimer Wheeler in1946 it seems that the city of Harappā was built on a site occupied bypeople using similar pottery. There is no evidence of the date of thefoundation of the other great city of Mohenjo Daro, for its lowest strata arenow below the level of the Indus, whose bed has slowly risen with thecenturies; though diggings have reached 30 feet below the surface, floodinghas prevented the excavation of the earliest levels of the city.

Thus the Harappā Culture, at least in the Panjāb, was later in itsbeginnings than the village cultures, but it was certainly in partcontemporary with them, for traces of mutual contact have been found; andsome of the village cultures survived the great civilization to the east ofthem. From the faint indications which are all the evidence we have, itwould seem that the Indus cities began in the first half, perhaps towards themiddle, of the 3rd millennium B.C.; it is almost certain that they continuedwell into the 2nd millennium. When these cities were first excavated nofortifications and few weapons were found, and no building could becertainly identified as a temple or a palace. The hypothesis was then putforward that the cities were oligarchic commercial republics, without sharpextremes of wealth and poverty, and with only a weak repressiveorganization; but the excavations at Harappā in 1946 and further discoveriesat Mohenjo Daro have shown that this idyllic picture is incorrect. Each cityhad a well-fortified citadel, which seems to have been used for bothreligious and governmental purposes. The regular planning of the streets,and the strict uniformity throughout the area of the Harappā culture in suchfeatures as weights and measures, the size of bricks, and even the layout ofthe great cities, suggest rather a single centralized state than a number offree communities.

Probably the most striking feature of the culture was its intense [Page 16] conservatism. At Mohenjo Daro nine strata of buildings have been revealed.

As the level of the earth rose from the periodic flooding of the Indus newhouses would be built almost exactly on the sites of the old, with onlyminor variations in ground plan; for nearly a millennium at least the streetplan of the cities remained the same. The script of the Indus people wastotally unchanged throughout their history. There is no doubt that they hadcontact with Mesopotamia, but they showed no inclination to adopt thetechnical advances of the more progressive culture. We must assume thatthere was continuity of government throughout the life of the civilization.

This unparalleled continuity suggests, in the words of Professor Piggott, “the unchanging traditions of the temple” rather than “the secular instability of the court”. 2 It seems in fact that the civilization of Harappa, like those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, was theocratic in character.

The two cities were built on a similar plan. To the west of each was a “citadel”, an oblong artificial platform some 30–50 feet high and about 400 x 200 yards in area (pl. V). This was defended by crenelated walls, and on it were erected the public buildings. Below it was the town proper, in eachcase at least a square mile in area. The main streets, some as much as 30feet wide, were quite straight (pl. VI a), and divided the city into largeblocks, within which were networks of narrow unplanned lanes. In neitherof the great cities has any stone building been found; standardized burntbrick of good quality was the usual building material for dwelling housesand public buildings alike. The houses, often of two or more stories, thoughthey varied in size, were all based on much the same plan—a squarecourtyard, round which were a number of rooms. The entrances wereusually in side alleys, and no windows faced on the streets, which musthave presented a monotonous vista of dull brick walls. The houses hadbathrooms, the design of which shows that the Harappan, like the modernIndian, preferred to take his bath standing, by pouring pitchers of waterover his head. The bathrooms were provided with drains, which flowed tosewers under the main streets, leading to soak-pits. The sewers werecovered throughout their length by large brick slabs. The unique seweragesystem of the Indus people must have been maintained by some municipalorganization, and is one of the most impressive of their achievements. Noother ancient civilization until that of the Romans had so efficient a systemof drains.

The average size of the ground floor of a house was about 30 feet square, but there were many bigger: obviously there were numerous well-to-do families in the Indus cities, which perhaps had a middle [Page 17] class larger and more important in the social scale than those of the contemporary civilizations of Sumer and Egypt. Remains of workmen’s dwellings have also been discovered at both sites-parallel rows of two-roomed cottages, atMohenjo Daro with a superficial area of 20 x 12 feet each, but at Harappāconsiderably larger; they bear a striking resemblance to the “coolie lines” ofmodern Indian tea and other estates. At Harappā rows of such buildingshave been found near the circular brick floors on which grain was pounded,and they were probably the dwellings of the workmen whose task was togrind corn for the priests and dignitaries who lived in the citadel. Drab andtiny as they were, these cottages were better dwellings than those in whichmany Indian coolies live at the present day.

The most striking of the few large buildings is the great bath in the citadel area of Mohenjo Daro. This is an oblong bathing pool 39 x 23 feet in area and 8 feet deep, constructed of beautiful brickwork made watertightwith bitumen (pl. VI b). It could be drained by [Page 18] an opening in onecorner and was surrounded by a cloister, on to which opened a number ofsmall rooms. Like the “tank” of a Hindu temple, it probably had a religiouspurpose, and the cells may have been the homes of priests. The specialattention paid by the people of the Harappā culture to cleanliness is hardlydue to the fact that they had notions of hygiene in advance of those of othercivilizations of their time, but indicates that, like the later Hindus, they hada strong belief in the purificatory effects of water from a ritual point ofview.

The largest building so far excavated is one at Mohenjo Daro with a superficial area of 230 x 78 feet, which may have been a palace. At Harappā a great granary has been discovered to the north of the citadel; thiswas raised on a platform of some 150 x 200 feet in area to protect it fromfloods, and was divided into storage blocks of 50 x 20 feet each. It wasdoubtless used for storing the corn which was collected from the peasantsas land tax, and we may assume that it had its counterpart at Mohenjo Daro.

The main food crops were wheat, barley, peas, and sesamum, the latter still an important crop in India for its seeds, which provide edible oil. There is no clear evidence of the cultivation of rice, but the Harappā people grew and used cotton. It is not certain that irrigation was known, although this is possible. The main domestic animals known to modern India had already been tamed-humped and humpless cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep, pigs,asses, dogs, and the domestic fowl. The elephant was well known, and mayalso have been tamed. The Harappa people may have known of the horse,since a few horse’s teeth have been found in the lowest stratum of theBalūchistān site of Rānā Ghundāī, probably dating from several centuriesearlier than the foundation of Harappā. This would indicate that horse-riding nomads found their way to N.-W. India in small numbers long beforethe Āryan invasion; but it is very doubtful whether the Harappa peoplepossessed domestic horses themselves, and if they did they must have beenvery rare animals. The bullock was probably the usual beast of burden.

On the basis of this thriving agricultural economy the Harappa peoplebuilt their rather unimaginative but comfortable civilization. Theirbourgeoisie had pleasant houses, and even their workmen, who may havebeen bondmen or slaves, had the comparative luxury of two-roomed brick-built cottages. Evidently a well organized commerce made these thingspossible. The cities undoubtedly traded with the village cultures ofBalūchistān. where outposts of the Harappa culture have been traced, butmany of their metals and semi-precious stones came from much longerdistances. From Kathiawar and the [Page 19] Deccan they obtained conchshell, which they used freely in decoration, and several types of stone.

Silver, turquoise and lapis lazuli were imported from Persia and Afghanistan. Their copper came either from Rajasthan or from Persia, while jadeite was probably obtained from Tibet or Central Asia.

Though their culture extended nearly to the mouth of the Indus the people of Harappā and Mohenjo Daro seem to have cared little for the sea.

Only two representations of ships have been found among their remains,and these are of small river vessels. But whether by sea or land, theproducts of the Indus reached Mesopotamia, for a number of typical Indusseals and a few other objects from the Indus Valley have been found inSumer at levels dating between about 2300 and 2000 B.C. Evidence ofSumerian exports to India is very scant and uncertain, and we must assumethat they were mainly precious metals and raw materials. The finding ofIndus seals suggests that merchants from India actually resided inMesopotamia; their chief merchandise was probably cotton, which hasalways been one of India’s staple exports, and which is known to have beenused in later Babylonia.

It seems that every merchant or mercantile family had a seal, bearing anemblem, often of a religious character, and a name or brief inscription in thetantalizingly indecipherable script. The standard Harappā seal was a squareor oblong plaque, usually made of the soft stone called steatite, which wasdelicately engraved and hardened by heating (pl. IX). The Mesopotamiancivilizations employed cylinder seals, which were rolled on clay tablets,leaving an impressed band bearing the device and inscription of the seal;one or two such seals have been found in Mohenjo Daro, but with devicesof the Harappa type. Over 2,000 seals have been discovered in the Induscities so far, and it would seem that every important citizen possessed one.

Their primary purpose was probably to mark the ownership of property, but they doubtless also served as amulets, and were regularly carried on the persons of their owners. Generally they depict animals, such as the bull,buffalo, goat, tiger and elephant, or what appear to be scenes from religiouslegend. Their brief inscriptions, never of more than twenty symbols andusually of not more than ten, are the only significant examples of theHarappa script to have survived.

This script had some 270 characters, evidently pictographic in origin, which had an ideographic or syllabic character. It may have been inspired by the earliest Sumerian script, which probably antedates it slightly, but it bears little resemblance to any of the scripts of the ancient Middle East, though attempts have been made to connect [Page 20] it with one or otherof them. The most striking similarities are with the symbols used untilcomparatively recent times by the natives of Easter Island, in the easternPacific,3 but the distance in space and time between the two cultures is sogreat that there is scarcely any possibility of there having been any form ofcontact or influence. We do not know what writing media were used,though it has been suggested that a small pot found at the lesser site ofChanhu Daro is an inkwell. Certainly the Harappans did not inscribe theirdocuments on clay tablets, or some of these would have been found in theremains of their cities.

They were not on the whole an artistic people. No doubt they had aliterature, with religious epics similar to those of Sumer and Babylon, butthese are forever lost to us. The inner walls of their houses were coated withmud plaster, but if any paintings were made on these walls all trace of themhas vanished. The outer walls, facing the streets, were apparently of plainbrick. Architecture was austerely utilitarian, a few examples of simpledecorative brickwork being the only ornamentation so far discovered. Notrace of monumental sculpture has been found anywhere in the remains, andif any of the larger buildings were temples they contained no large icons,unless these were made of wood or other perishable material.

But if the Harappā folk could not produce works of art on a large scale they excelled in those of small compass. Their most notable artistic achievement was perhaps in their seal engravings, especially those of animals, which they delineated with powerful realism and evident affection.

The great urus bull with its many dewlaps, the rhinoceros with knobbly armoured hide, the tiger roaring fiercely, and the many other animals (pl.

IX) are the work of craftsmen who studied their subjects and loved them.

Equally interesting are some of the human figurines. The red sandstone torso of a man (pl. VIII a) is particularly impressive for its realism. The modelling of the rather heavy abdomen seems to look forward to the style of later Indian sculpture, and it has even been suggested that this figurine isa product of much later times, which by some strange accident found itsway into the lower stratum; but this is very unlikely, for the figure hascertain features, notably the strange indentations on the shoulders, whichcannot be explained on this hypothesis. The bust of another male figure, insteatite (pl. VII), seems to show an attempt at portraiture. It has beensuggested that the head is that of a priest, with his eyes half closed inmeditation, but it is possible that he is a man of Mongolian type, thepresence of which type in the Indus Valley has been proved by thediscovery of a single skull at Mohenjo Daro.

[Page 21] Most striking of the figurines is perhaps the bronze “dancing girl” (pl. VIII b). Naked but for a necklace and a series of bangles almost covering one arm, her hair dressed in a complicated coiffure, standing in a provocative posture, with one arm on her hip and one lanky leg half bent,this young woman has an air of lively pertness, quite unlike anything in thework of other ancient civilizations. Her thin boyish figure, and those of theuninspiring mother goddesses, indicate, incidentally, that the canons offemale beauty among the Harappa people were very different from those oflater India. It has been suggested that this “dancing girl” is a representativeof a class of temple dancers and prostitutes, such as existed in contemporaryMiddle Eastern civilizations and were an important feature of later Hinduculture, but this cannot be proved. It is not certain that the girl is a dancer,much less a temple dancer.

The Harappā people made brilliantly naturalistic models of animals, specially charming being the tiny monkeys and squirrels used as pinheads and beads (pl. IX g). For their children they made cattle with movable heads, model monkeys which would slide down a string, little toy carts, andwhistles shaped like birds, all of terracotta. They also made rough terracottastatuettes of women, usually naked or nearly naked, but with elaboratehead-dresses (fig. ii, c); these are certainly icons of the Mother Goddess,and are so numerous that they seem to have been kept in nearly every home.

They are very crudely fashioned, so we must assume that the goddess was not favoured by the upper classes, who commanded the services of the best craftsmen, but that her effigies were mass produced by humble potters to meet popular demand.

Though they had not completely given up the use of stone tools theHarappā people used implements of copper and bronze; but in manyrespects they were technologically backward in comparison withMesopotamia. The Sumerians very early invented knives and spearheadswith ribs in the middle for extra strength, and axeheads with holes for theshafts; but the blades of Harappā were flat and easily bent, while theaxeheads had to be lashed to their shafts; only in the topmost levels do wefind tools of a better type, which were probably left by invaders. In onerespect the Harappā people were technically in advance of theircontemporaries-they had devised a saw with undulating teeth, whichallowed the dust to escape freely from the cut, and much simplified thecarpenter’s task. From this we may assume that they had particular skill incarpentry. They made beautiful beads of semi-precious stones and faience,and their pottery, though mostly plain and uninteresting, was well made,and a few specimens are delicately painted (fig. iv).

[Page 22] The men wore robes which left one shoulder bare, and the garments of the upper classes were often richly patterned. Beards wereworn, and men and women alike had long hair. The elaborate headdressesof the Mother Goddess figures probably had their counterparts in the festiveattire of the richer women. The goddesses often wear only a very short skirt,but on one seal women, perhaps priestesses, are depicted with longer skirts,reaching to just below the knee. The coiffures of the women were oftenelaborate, and pigtails were also popular, as in present-day India. Womenloved jewellery, and wore heavy bangles in profusion, large necklaces, andearrings.

As far as we can reconstruct it from our fragmentary knowledge, thereligion of the Harappā people had some features suggesting thosecharacteristics of later Hinduism which are not to be found in the earlieststratum of Indian religious literature. The Mother Goddess, for instance,reappears only after the lapse of over a thousand years from the fall ofHarappa. As already stated she was evidently the divinity of the people, andthe upper classes seem to have preferred a god, who also shows featuresfound in later Hinduism. As well as the figurines already mentioned, whichmay represent divinities, there are a few in terracotta of bearded nude menwith coiled hair; their posture, rigidly upright, with the legs slightly apart,and the arms held parallel to the sides of the body, but not touching it,closely resembles the stance called by the Jainas kāyotsarga, in whichmeditating teachers are often portrayed in later times; the repetition of thisfigure, in exactly the same posture, would suggest that he was a god. Aterracotta mask of a horned deity has also been found.

Fig. iv.—Painted Pottery of the Harappā CultureThe most striking deity of the Harappā culture is the horned god of theseals (pl. IX c). He is depicted on three specimens, in two [Page 23] seatedon a stool or small dais, and in the third on the ground; in all three hisposture is one well known to later Indian holy men, with the legs drawn upclose to the body and the two heels touching, a position quite impossible tothe average European without much practice. The god’s body is nude,except for many bangles and what appear to be necklaces, and he wears apeculiar head-dress, consisting of a pair of horns, which may have beenthought of as growing from his head, with a plant-like object between them.

On the largest of the seals he is surrounded by four wild animals, an elephant, a tiger, a rhinoceros and a buffalo, and beneath his stool are two deer, as in the representations of the Buddha preaching his first sermon in the Deer-park at BanĀras The animals, the plant-like growth from the head,and the fact that he is ithyphallic, indicate that he is a fertility god. His facehas a fierce tigerish aspect, and one authority has suggested that it is notmeant to be human; 4 to the right and left of the head are smallprotuberances which were believed by Sir John Marshall to represent asecond and third face on either side. Marshall boldly called this god Proto-Śiva, and the name has been generally accepted; certainly the horned godhas much in common with the Śiva of later Hinduism, who is, in his mostimportant aspect, a fertility deity, is known as Paśupati, the Lord of Beasts,and is sometimes depicted withthreefaces.Sacred animals played a big part in the religion of the Indus people.Though all the animals shown on the seals may not have been particularlysacred, the bull occurs in contexts which prove that he at least was so; onmany seals he stands before a peculiar object which is evidently not amanger, and has no utilitarian purpose, but is a “cult object”, probably atable on which corn was grown for fertility rites. 5 On some seals small linesemerge from the table, which may represent the growing corn, no doubteaten by the sacred bull as part of the ceremony. The bull is usuallydepicted with a single horn, and has sometimes been referred to as aunicorn, though there is little doubt that the artist was trying to portray anormal bull, whose second horn was concealed by the first. In Hinduism thebull is specially associated with the god Siva, but he does notseemtohavebeenconnectedwiththe“ProtoSiva” of Harappa, for he is not among theanimals surrounding the god on the famous seal1. The cow, so revered inlater Hinduism, is nowhere depicted.Certain trees were sacred, as they are in Hinduism today, notably thepīpal, which is specially honoured by Buddhists as the species under whichthe Buddha found enlightenment. One very interesting seal (pl. IX d)depicts a horned goddess in a pīpal tree, worshipped [Page 24] by a figurealso wearing horns, with a human-headed goat watching the ceremony anda row of seven pigtailed women, probably priestesses, in attendance.One of the few traces of Sumerian contact is to be found in the sealshowing a hero grappling with two tigers (pl. IX e)—a variant of a famousMesopotamian motif in which the hero Gilgamesh is depicted fighting twolions. The rotund face of the hero, and the peculiar treatment of his hair,suggest that he represents the sun, and that the night-prowling tigers are thepowers of darkness.Phallic worship was an important element of Harappā religion. Manycone-shaped objects have been found, which are almost certainlyformalized representations of the phallus. The linga or phallic emblem inlater Hinduism is the symbol of the god Śiva, who is more commonlyworshipped thus than as an icon; it is a fair inference that these objects wereconnected with the ithyphallic “Proto-Śiva” of the seals. It has beensuggested that certain large ringshaped stones are formalizedrepresentations of the female generative organ and were symbols of theMother Goddess, but this is most doubtful.Until Sir Mortimer Wheeler’s work at Harappā in 1946 nothing wasknown with certainty of the way in which these people disposed of theirdead; but from a cemetery then discovered, containing at least 57 graves, itappears that burial was the usual rite. The whole cemetery has not beenexcavated and the evidence is not yet fully assessed, but it is clear that thedead were buried in an extended posture with pottery vessels and personalornaments.

Who were the people who built this great civilization? Some Indianhistorians have tried to prove that they were the Aryans, the people whocomposed the Ṛ g Veda, but this is quite impossible. From the skeletalremains so far examined it appears that some of the Harappans were peopleof the long-headed, narrow-nosed, slender Mediterranean type, found allover the ancient Middle East and in Egypt, and forming an importantelement of the Indian population at the present day. A second element wasthe Proto-Australoid, with flat nose and thick lips, related to the Australianaborigines and to some of the wild hill-tribes of modern India. A singleskull of Mongolian type has been found, and one of the short-headed Alpinetype. The bearded steatite head to which we have referred shows elementsof both the latter types, while the bronze dancing girl seems certainly Proto-Australoid. Then as now, N.-W. India was the meeting-place of many races.The modern South Indian is usually a blend of Mediterranean and Proto-Australoid, the two chief ethnic factors in the Harappā culture; [Page 25]moreover the Harappā religion seems to show many similarities with thoseelements of Hinduism which are specially popular in the Dravidian country.In the hills of Balūchistān. where the people of the Nal and Zhob Culturesbuilt their little villages, the Br?hu?s, though ethnically now predominantlyIranian, speak a Dravidian language. Thus it has been suggested that theHarappā folk were Dravidians, and Father H. Heras, one of the authoritieswho have tried to read their script, has even claimed that their language wasa very primitive form of Tamil.

## PIONEERS OF INDOLOGY
PLATE IV
It might be suggested that the Harappā people consisted of a Proto- Australoid element, which at one time may have covered the whole of India, overlaid by a Mediterranean one, which entered India at a very earlyperiod, bringing with it the elements of civilization. Later, under thepressure of further invasions, this Mediterranean element spread throughoutthe sub-continent, and, again mixing with the indigenous peoples, formedthe Dravidians. The chief objection to this theory is that the megalithserected by the early Dravidians in South India have been shown to be notvery ancient; a recent theory even holds that the Dravidians came to Indiafrom the west by sea as late as the second half of the 1st millennium B.C. 6We can only say with certainty that some of the inhabitants of the Induscities were of a typewidelyfoundfurthertothewest,andthattheirdescendants must survive in the present-day population of India.There is no Archæological evidence of cities of the Harappā peoplebeyond the Indus basin, but small outposts existed in Kathiawar; yet it doesnot follow that the rest of India was wholly ignorant of the Harappā culture.Certain finds of copper implements in the district of R?nch? (S. Bih?r)suggest that the peoples of North India learnt the use of metal fromHarappa, for the blades are without the strengthening midrib; but the datingof these objects is very uncertain, and they may be much later than the fallof Harappā.Whatever the case may be, pre-Āryan India made certain advances inhusbandry for which the whole world owes her a debt. Cotton was to thebest of our knowledge first used by the Harappā people. Rice was not oneof their staple crops, nor was it grown in neolithic China, whose main foodcrop was millet. Wild rice is known in Eastern India, and it is here, in theswampy Ganges Valley, that it was probably first cultivated by the neolithiccontemporaries of the Harappa people. The water buffalo, known to theHarappā people, was a comparatively late arrival in China, and it may havebeen first domesticated in the Gangetic Plain, though some authoritiesbelieve that it originated in the Philippine Islands.[Page 26] Perhaps the most widely appreciated of prehistoric India’s giftsto the world is the domestic fowl. Ornithologists are agreed that alldomestic species descend from the wild Indian jungle fowl. The Harappapeople knew the domestic fowl, though its remains are few and it is notdepicted on the seals. It was probably first tamed by neolithic Indians in theGanges Valley, whence it found its way by the Burma route to China, whereit appears in the middle of the 2nd millennium. The Egyptians knew it atabout the same time, as a rare luxury bird.7 Clearly India, even at thisremote period, was not wholly cut off from the rest of the world.

## THE END OF THE INDUS CITIES
When Harappā was first built the citadel was defended by a great turreted wall, 40 feet wide at the base and 35 feet high. In the course of the centuriesthis wall was refaced more strongly than before, though there is no evidencethat the city was dangerously threatened by enemies. But towards the end ofHarappa’s existence its defences were further strengthened, and onegateway was wholly blocked. Danger threatened from the west.

First to suffer were the Balūichistān villages. The earliest level of the site of Rānā Ghundāī shows that bands of horse-riding invaders were present in the region before 3000 B.C., but they soon disappeared, to give way to the peasant culture which occupied the site in the 3rd millennium and was contemporary with the Indus cities. Then, in 2000 B.C. or a little later, the village was burnt, and a new, coarser type of pottery appears-evidently invaders had occupied the site. Soon afterwards came other invaders, usingunpainted encrusted pottery. Similar though less complete evidence appearsin other North Balūchistān sites, while in South Balūchistān an intrusiveculture founded a settlement at Shāhī Tump, not far from Sutkagen Dor,which was the Harappā Culture’s most westerly outpost. The Shāhī Tumppeople used the shaft-hole axe and round copper seals, and replaced theearlier local culture, known to archæologists as the Kullī Culture. In the lastphase of the life of Mohenjo Daro painted pottery and stone vesselsresembling those of Balūchistān appear, and this may indicate a large influxof Kullī refugees, who brought their crafts with them.

After the barbarians had conquered the outlying villages the ancient lawsand rigid organization of the Indus cities must have suffered great strain. AtMohenjo Daro large rooms were divided into smaller, and mansions becametenements; potters’ kilns were built within the city boundaries, and oneeven in the middle of a street. [Page 27] The street plan was no longermaintained. Hoards of jewellery were buried. Evidently the city wasoverpopulated and law and order were less well maintained, perhapsbecause the barbarians were already ranging the provinces and the city wasfull of newcomers, whom the city fathers could not force into the age-oldpattern of the city’s culture.When the end came it would seem that most of the citizens of MohenjoDaro had fled; but a group of huddled skeletons in one of the houses andone skeleton of a woman lying on the steps of a well suggest that a fewstragglers were overtaken by the invaders. In this level a fine copper axehas been found, with a very strong shaft-hole and an adze blade oppositethat of the axe-a beautiful tool, adapted both for war and peace, andsuperior to anything the Harappa people possessed (fig. v). Swords withstrengthening midribs also make their appearance. A single pot burial of aman of some-what Mongol type may be that of one of the invaders.


Fig. v.-Axes of the Indus Citiesa. Inscribed unsocketed axe-head. b. Shaft-hole axe-adzeFrom Harappā comes evidence of a different kind. Here, near the oldercemetery of interments, is another cemetery on a higher level, containingfractional burials in pots of men with short-headed Armenoid skulls. Askull of similar type was buried in the citadel itself. At Chanhu Daro, on thelower Indus, the Harappā people were replaced by squatters, living in smallhuts with fireplaces, an innovation which suggests that they came from acolder climate. These people, though unsophisticated in many respects, hadsuperior tools and weapons. Similar settlements were made in Balūchistānat about the same time. Among the scanty remains of these invaders there isclear evidence of the presence of the horse. The Indus cities fell tobarbarians who triumphed not only through greater military prowess, butalso because they were equipped with better weapons, and had learnt tomake full use of the swift and terror-striking beast of the steppes.The date of these great events can only be fixed very approximately fromsynchronisms with the Middle East. Sporadic traces of contact can be foundbetween the Indus cities and Sumeria, and there is some reason to believethat these contacts continued under the First [Page 28] Dynasty of Babylon,which produced the great lawgiver Hammurabi. This dynasty was alsooverwhelmed by barbarians, the Kassites, who came from the hills of Iranand conquered by virtue of their horse-drawn chariots. After the Kassiteinvasion no trace of contact with the Indus can be found in Mesopotamia,and it is therefore likely that the Indus cities fell at about the same time asthe dynasty of Hammurabi. Earlier authorities placed the latter event in thefirst centuries of the 2nd millennium B.C., but new evidence, whichappeared shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, has resultedin a revised chronology. The fall of the First Babylonian Dynasty is nowthought to have taken place about 1600 B.C.The earliest Indian literary source we possess is the Ṛ g Veda, most ofwhich was composed in the second half of the 2nd millennium. It isevidently the work of an invading people, who have not yet fully subjugatedthe original inhabitants of N.-W. India. In his great report on theexcavations at Mohenjo Daro, Sir John Marshall maintained that some twocenturies or more elapsed between the fall of the Indus cities and theinvasion of the Aryans; but the more recent excavations at Harappā andelsewhere, the revision of the chronology of Babylon, and indications in theṚ g Veda itself, have all tended to reduce the gap. Many competentauthorities, led by Sir R. Mortimer Wheeler, now believe that Harappā wasoverthrown by the Aryans. It is suggested that the interments in the latercemetery at Harappā are those of “true Vedic Aryans”, and that the forts orcitadels which the Vedic war-god Indra is said to have destroyed includedHarappā in their number.There is not enough evidence to say with certainty that the destroyers ofthe Indus cities were members of the group of related tribes whose priestscomposed the Ṛ g Veda, but it is probable that the fall of this greatcivilization was an episode in the movement of charioteering peoples whichaltered the face of the whole civilized world in the 2nd millennium B.C.

## INDO-EUROPEANS AND ĀRYANS
The invaders of India called themselves Āryas, a word generally anglicized into Āryans. The name was also used by the ancient Persians, and survives in the word Iran, while Eire, the name of the most westerly land reached by Indo-European peoples in ancient times, is also cognate.Here we cannot discuss the many theories on the origin of these people, butcan only give that which seems to us most reasonable, and which, webelieve, would be accepted by a majority of those who specialize in thesubject.

PLATE VI
[Page 29] About 2000 B.C. the great steppeland which stretches from Poland to Central Asia was inhabited by semi-nomadic barbarians, who were tall, comparatively fair, and mostly long-headed. They had tamed the horse, which they harnessed to light chariots with spoked wheels, of a much faster and better type than the lumbering ass-drawn cars with four solid wheels which were the best means of transport known to contemporarySumer. They were mainly pastoral, but practised a little agriculture. Thoughthey may never have come into direct contact with the Sumerians, they hadadopted some Mesopotamian innovations, notably the shaft-hole axe. In theearly part of the 2nd millennium, whether from pressure of population,desiccation of pasture lands, or from both causes, these people were on themove. They migrated in bands westwards, southwards and eastwards,conquering local populations, and intermarrying with them to form a rulingclass. They brought with them their patrilinear tribal organization, theirworship of sky gods, and their horses and chariots. In most of the lands inwhich they settled their original language gradually adapted itself to thetongues of the conquered peoples. Some invaded Europe, to become theancestors of the Greeks, Latins, Celts and Teutons, while others appeared inAnatolia, and from the mixture of these with the original inhabitants thegreat empire of the Hittites grew up. Yet others remained in their old home,the ancestors of the later Baltic and Slavonic peoples, while others movedsouthwards and, from the Caucasus and the Iranian tableland, led manyattacks on the Middle Eastern civilizations. The Kassites, who conqueredBabylon, were led by men of this stock. In the 14th century B.C. thereappeared in N.-E. Syria a people called Mitanni, whose kings had Indo-Iranian names, and a few of whose gods are familiar to every student ofIndian religion: Indara, Uruvna (the Vedic god Varuna), Mitira, andNaśatiya. As well as the Mitanni other chiefs in Syria and Palestine hadnames of Indo-Iranian type.The marauding tribesmen gradually merged with the older populations ofthe Middle East, and the ancient civilizations, invigorated by fresh bloodand ideas, rose to new heights of material culture; the peaceful andconservative cities of the Indus valley could neither withstand nor absorbthe invaders. The culture which was to succeed that of Harappā was, as weshall see, diametrically opposed to its predecessor. Only after manycenturies did some elements of the older civilization, kept alive no doubt bythe poorer people and serfs, begin to influence the conquerors.The Āryan invasion of India was not a single concerted action, but onecovering centuries and involving many tribes, perhaps not all [Page 30] ofthe same race and language. It seems certain that many of the old villagecultures of the western hills were destroyed before the cities of the IndusValley, but otherwise the course of Āryan expansion cannot be plotted,owing to the paucity of material remains. Evidently the invaders did nottake to living in cities, and after the fall of Harappā and Mohenjo Daro thePanjāb and Sind became a land of little villages, with buildings of wood andreed the remains of which have long since perished. For over a thousandyears from the fall of Harappā India is almost an Archæological blank,which at present can only be filled by literary sources.
## THE ĀRYANS IN INDIA. THE PROTO-HISTORIC PERIOD
Among the many peoples who entered India in the 2nd millennium B.C.was a group of related tribes whose priests had perfected a very advancedpoetic technique, which they used for the composition of hymns to be sungin praise of their gods at sacrifices. These tribes, chief of which was that ofthe Bharatas, settled mainly in East Panjāb and in the region between theSatlaj and the Jamnā which later became known as Brahmāvarta. Thehymns composed by their priests in their new home were carefully handeddown by word of mouth, and early in the 1st millennium B.C. were collectedand arranged. They were still not committed to writing, but by now theywere looked on as so sacred that even minor alterations in their text werenot permitted, and the priestly schools which preserved them devised themost remarkable and effective system of checks and counter checks toensure their purity. Even when the art of writing was widely known in Indiathe hymns were rarely written, but, thanks to the brilliant feats of memoryof many generations of brāhmans, and the extreme sanctity which thehymns were thought to possess, they have survived to the present day in aform which, from internal evidence, appears not to have been seriouslytampered with for nearly three thousand years. This great collection ofhymns is the Ṛ g Veda, still in theory the most sacred of the numeroussacred texts of the Hindus.

The period of the Vedas, Brāhmanas and Upanisads is a sort of transition from prehistory to history. If history, as distinct from archæology, is the study of the human past from written sources, then India’s history beginswith the Aryans. The Ṛ g Veda, and the great body of oral religious literaturewhich followed it in the first half of the 1st millennium B.C., are part of theliving Hindu tradition. The Vedic hymns are still recited at weddings andfunerals, and in the daily devotions of the brāhman. Thus they are part of[Page 31] historical India, and do not belong to her buried prehistoric past.But they tell us little about the great events of the time, except in irritatinglyvague incidental references; evenonsocialconditionstheirinformationisscant; only on religion and thought is the historian more fully informed.Yet from the hymns of the Rg and Atharva Vedas, the sacrificialinstructions of the brāhmanas, and the mysticism of the Upanisads, theoutlines of a culture emerge, though often all too vaguely, and here andthere we see the faint wraiths of great sages and tribal leaders, whoseimportance for their times was such that their names were recorded insacred literature. Around these phantoms later tradition draped a glitteringmantle of legend, legend in which many Indians still implicitly believe, andwhich, in other contexts, is exceedingly important. But when the mantlesare removed only vague shadows remain, little more than the names ofchieftains who three thousand years ago waged successful war against theirenemies. For the period before the time of the Buddha we canonly trace thegeneral character of the civilization which produced the Vedic literature andgive a brief and tentative sketch of its expansion.## THE CULTURE OF THE Ṛ g VedaNo real synchronisms are contained in the Ṛ g Veda itself, to give us anycertain information on the date of its composition. Some authorities in thepast claimed an exceedingly early date for it, on the basis of tradition andambiguous astronomical references in the hymns themselves-it was evenbelieved by one very respected Indian scholar that it was as old as 6000 B.C.The discovery of the Indus cities, which have nothing in common with theculture described in the Veda and are evidently pre-Vedic, proves that thehymns cannot have been composed before the end of Harappa. The greatdevelopment in culture, religion and language which is evident in the laterVedic literature shows that a long period must have elapsed between thetime of the composition of the last hymns of the Ṛ g Veda and the days ofthe Buddha-perhaps as much as 500 years. It is therefore probable that mostof the Ṛ g Veda was composed between 1500 and 1000 B.C., though thecomposition of some of the most recent hymns and the collation of thewhole collection may have taken place a century or two later.When the hymns were written the focus of Āryan culture was the regionbetween the Jamnā (Sanskrit Yamunā) and Satlaj ( Śutudrī), south of themodern Ambālā, and along the upper course of the river [Page 32]Sarasvatī. The latter river is now an insignificant stream, losing itself in thedesert of Rajasthan, but it then flowed broad and strong, and probablyjoined the Indus below the confluence of the Satlaj. The Vedic poets knewthe Himalayas, but not the land south of the Jamnā, and they did notmention the Vindhyas. To the east the Aryans had not expanded far beyondthe Jamnā, and the Ganges ( Gangā) is mentioned only in one late hymn.At this time the Āryans had not wholly subjugated the indigenousinhabitants. Though many hymns refer to battles between one Aryan tribeand another, there is, underlying this intertribal rivalry, a sense of solidarityagainst the Dāsas or Dasyus, who evidently represent the survivors of theHarappā Culture, and kindred peoples of the Panjāb and the North-West.The Dāsas are described as dark and ill-favoured, bull-lipped, snub-nosed,worshippers of the phallus, and of hostile speech. They are rich in cattle,and dwell in fortified places called pur, of which the Āryan war-god Indrahas destroyed hundreds. The main work of destroying the settlements of theDāsas had been accomplished some time before the composition of thehymns, and the great battles which must then have taken place are alreadymisted over with legend; but the Dāsas are still capable of massing armiesof 10,000 men against the invaders.Other enemies of the Āryans are the Panis, who are described as wealthypeople who refuse to patronize the Vedic priests, and who steal the cattle ofthe Aryans. They were not so strongly hated as the Dāsas, and theirsettlements seem often to have continued unmolested. It has been suggestedthat the Panis were Semitic traders, but the evidence is so slight that thisconclusion cannot be accepted.

The Aryans were not uninfluenced by the earlier inhabitants. In classical Sanskrit the word d?sa regularly means “slave” or “bondman”, and in the later hymns of the Ṛ g Veda it was already acquiring that meaning, while the feminine form dāsī is used in the sense of a “slave-girl” throughout the book; but, though many of the vanquished Dāsas must have been enslaved, some seem to have come to terms with the conquerors, and one Dāsa chief is mentioned as following Āryan ways and patronizing the brāhmans.8 Oneresult of this contact of Āryan and non-Āryan is evident even in the earlieststratum of the Ṛ g Veda, the language of which is appreciably affected bynon-Indo-European influences. All Indian languages, from Vedic to themodern vernaculars, contain a series of sounds, the retroflex or cerebralconsonants, which cannot be traced in any other Indo-European tongues,not even in Old Iranian, which is closely akin to Sanskrit. These soundsmust have developed quickly, from the efforts of non-Aryans to master thelanguage of their [Page 33] conquerors. No doubt the invaders oftenmarried indigenous women, whose children would be bilingual, and after afew generations the Aryans’ original language would show the effect of theadmixture of aboriginal blood. Numerous words in the Ṛ g Veda are notconnected with any known Indo-European roots, and were evidentlyborrowed from the natives. Non-Aryan influence on religion and culturemust also have been felt very early, and the gradual disappearance of muchof the original Indo-European heritage beneath successive layers of non-Aryan innovations can be traced through the early religious literature ofIndia.The primitiveness of early Āryan society was much exaggerated by some19th-century Indologists, who thought they found in the highly formalizedand rigidly controlled style of the Ṛ g Veda the first outpourings of thehuman spirit and an echo of Rousseau’s noble savage. In fact, by the timethat even the earliest hymns were composed the Aryans were not savages,but were on the fringes of civilization. Their military technique was inadvance of that of the Middle East, their priestly schools had raised thetribal sacrifice to a fine art, and their poetry was elaborate and formalized.On the other hand they had not developed a city civilization. The completeabsence of any words connected with writing in the Ṛ g Veda, despite itssize and the many contexts in which such words might be expected tooccur, is almost certain proof that the Aryans were illiterate. They were apeople of warlike stockbreeders, organized in tribes rather than inkingdoms. Their culture bears a generic likeness to that of Beowulf, theearlier Icelandic sagas, and the old Irish prose epics, and was less advancedthan that depicted in the Iliad.The tribes were ruled by chiefs who bore the title rājā, a word related tothe Latin rex. The rājā was not an absolute monarch, for the government ofthe tribe was in part the responsibility of the tribal councils, the sabhā andsamiti. These two words occur together in many contexts and the distinctionbetween them is not wholly clear-perhaps the first was a meeting of thegreat men of the tribe, while the second was a mass gathering of all freetribesmen, or of heads of families. These two bodies exerted muchinfluence on the king and their approval was necessary to ensure hisaccession. Some tribes seem to have had no hereditary chief, but weregoverned directly by the tribal council, for in one passage9 we read of kingssitting down together in the assembly, which suggests that, as in some lateroligarchic clans, the title of raja was taken by all the great men of the tribe,who governed it through a folk-moot.

But hereditary kingship was the rule, and the rājā, dwelling in a fine hall,had a rudimentary court, attended by courtiers ( sabhāsad) [Page 34] andchiefs of septs ( grāmanī). Already he had a general (senānī), who wasresponsible under the king for minor campaigns and cattle-raids againstneighbouring tribes. Very important was the chief priest ( purohita), who byhis sacrifices ensured the prosperity of the tribe in peace, and its victory inwar. Often the purohita appears as a tribal medicine-man, performingmagical ceremonies and muttering spells for victory both before and duringbattle.

The Āryans looked on the king primarily as a leader in war, responsiblefor the defence of the tribe. He was in no sense divine at this early period,and had no religious functions, except to order sacrifices for the good of thetribe and to support the priests who performed them. The priest-king ofsome other early cultures had no counterpart in Vedic India. There was noregular revenue system and the king was maintained by the tribute of hissubjects and the booty won in battle. If the king had judicial functions, as hecertainly had later, there is no reference to them; murder was probablypunished by a system of wergeld, as with the Anglo-Saxons and some otherearly Indo-European peoples, but beyond this we have no information onthe administration of justice in the time of the Ṛ g Veda.Several chieftains are mentioned by name, and around some of them latertradition has embroidered very unreliable stories-but only one raja isrecorded in the Ṛ g Veda as performing any deed of historical importance.This is Sudās, king of the Bharatas, the tribe dwelling on the upper reachesof the Sarasvatī River. Three poems of the collection describe the great“Battle of the Ten Kings” at which Sudās defeated a coalition of ten tribesof the Panjāb and the North-West, on the banks of the River Parusnī, themodern Rāvī. The most powerful of these ten tribes was that of the Pūrus,who dwelt on the lower Sarasvatī, and were the Bharatas’ westernneighbours; their king, Purukutsa, was apparently killed in the battle. In thesucceeding age we hear no more of either Bharatas or Pūrus, but a newtribe, that of the Kurus, controls the old land of the Bharatas and much ofthe northern Ganges-Jamnā Doāb. In the traditional genealogy of the Kuruchiefs both Bharata and Pūru occur as names of their ancestors, and they arereferred to indiscriminately as “sons of Bharata” and “sons of Pūru”. Thetwo tribes no doubt merged as a result of the conquest of one by the other,and this process of fusion, whereby tribes became peoples and nations, musthave been going on all through the Vedic period.When the Āryans entered India there was already a class division in theirtribal structure. Even in the earliest hymns we read of the ksatra, thenobility, and the viś, the ordinary tribesmen, and the records of several otherearly Indo-European peoples suggest that a [Page 35] tribal aristocracy wasa feature of Indo-European society even before the tribes migrated fromtheir original home. As they settled among the darker aboriginals theAryans seem to have laid greater stress than before on purity of blood, andclass divisions hardened, to exclude those Dāsas who had found a place onthe fringes of Aryan society, and those Aryans who had intermarried withthe Dāsas and adopted their ways. Both these groups sank in the socialscale. At the same time the priests, whose sacrificial lore was becomingmore and more complicated, and who therefore required greater skill andtraining, were arrogating higher privileges to themselves. By the end of theRg Vedic period society was divided into four great classes, and thisfourfold division was given religious sanction and looked on asfundamental. This is evident from one of the most important hymns of thecollection, in which the four classes are said to have emanated from thedismembered primeval man, who was sacrificed by the gods at thebeginning of the world (p. 240f).The four classes, the priest ( brāhmana), warrior ( ksatriya), peasant( vaiśdya) and serf (śūdra), were crystallizing throughout the period of theṚ g Veda. They have survived to the present day. The Sanskrit word used forthem, varna, means “colour”, and itself indicates their origin in thedevelopment of the old tribal class structure in contact with people ofdifferent complexion and alien culture. The term varna does not mean“caste”, and has never meant “caste”, by which convenient word it is oftenloosely translated (p. 148).

The basic unit of Āryan society was the family. A group of related families formed a sept or grāma, a term which later regularly meant “village”, but which in the Ṛ g Veda usually refers to a group of kinsfolk rather than to a settlement. The family was staunchly patrilinear andpatriarchal. The wife, though she enjoyed a respectable position, wasdefinitely subordinate to her husband. Marriage was usually monogamous,and apparently indissoluble, for no reference to divorce or the remarriage ofwidows occurs in the Ṛ g Veda.Āhe Aryans followed a mixed pastoral and agricultural economy, inwhich cattle played a predominant part. The farmer prays for increase ofcattle; the warrior expects cattle as booty; the sacrificial priest is rewardedfor his services with cattle. Cattle were in fact a sort of currency, and valueswere reckoned in heads of cattle. There is no evidence that they were heldsacred at this time-the cow is in one or two places given the epithet “not tobe killed”, but this may only imply her economic importance. In any case itis quite clear that both oxen and cows were slaughtered for food.The horse was almost as important as the cow, though mainly for militaryreasons. The chestnut horses of the Aryans, harnessed to [Page 36] lightchariots, must have terrifiedthepeopleof the Indus Valley, as the horses ofthe conquistadores terrified the Aztecs and Incas. A few hymns of the Ṛ gVeda, which, according to the rubric, describe adivinehorseDadhikra,contain some of the finest lines on the horse in the world’s literature, andrecall the famous passage in praise of the war-horse in theBookofJob.10“Rushingtoglory,tothecapture of herds, swooping down as ahungry falcon, eager to be first, he darts amid the ranks of the chariots,happy as a bridegroom making a garland, spurning thedustandchampingat the bit.“And the victorious steed and faithful, his body obedient [to hisdriver] in battle, speeding on through the mêlée, stirs up the dust to fallon his brows.“And at his deep neigh, like the thunder of heaven, the foementremble in fear, for he fights against thousands, and none can resisthim, so terrible is his charge.” 11Though there are passages which appear to refer to riding, the horsenormally drew a chariot. References to this vehicle-a favourite subject forsimiles and metaphors-are so numerous that it is possible to reconstruct it inconsiderable detail. It was a light chariot with two spoked wheels, drawn bytwo horses yoked abreast, and carrying two warriors.Among other domestic animals the Āryans knew the sheep, whichprovided wool, their chief textile, and the goat. The elephant is onlymentioned in late hymns, and then as a wild animal.A divine bitch, Sarama, plays an important part in a legend which cannotbe fully reconstructed, but the dog did not mean as much to the people ofthe Ṛ g Veda as it did to a kindred Āryan pastoral people, the ancientIranians, who made it a sacred animal.

Though stockbreeding receives more attention from the poets, agriculturemust also have been important, but it seems to have been looked on asrather plebeian, and therefore was not much referred to. Only one word isused for corn— yava, which later meant barley, but at this period may haveimplied all species of cultivated grain. There are references to ploughingand reaping, and others which have been doubtfully interpreted as showingthat the Aryans knew something of irrigation.The Āryans were a wild, turbulent people and had few of the taboos[Page 37] of later India. They were much addicted to inebriating drinks, ofwhich they had at least two, soma and surā. Soma was drunk at sacrificesand its use was sanctified by religion (p. 235f). Surā was purely secular, andwas evidently very potent; in more than one passage it is mentioned withdisapproval by the priestly poets.

They loved music, and played the flute, lute and harp, to theaccompaniment of cymbals and drums. They used the heptatonic scale,similar to our own major scale, which is thought by some to have originatedin Sumeria and to have been spread by the IndoEuropean peoples. There arereferences to singing and dancing, and to dancing-girls, who may have beenprofessional.

Besides these amusements the Āryans delighted in gambling. At all timesIndia has loved to gamble. In the remains of the Indus cities numerous dicehave been found, and the Aryans have left their own record of theirgambling propensities in the beautiful “Gamester’s Lament”, one of the fewpredominantly secular poems which by lucky chancehavefoundtheirwayinto the Ṛ g Veda (p. 403ff).Though they had not developed a city civilization, and did not build instone or brick, the Aryans were technically well equipped. Their bronze-smiths were highly skilled, and produced tools and weapons much superiorto those of the Harappā Culture. They, and the carpenters and chariot-makers, are frequently referred to in the hymns with much respect. There isno good reason to believe that iron was used in India at this period. Ayas,one of the terms for metal in the Ṛ g Veda, came to mean iron at a later date,and is related to the German word Eisen and the English iron; but it is alsoakin to the Latin aes, meaning bronze, and it certainly means this metal orcopper in the Ṛ g Veda. No trace of iron has been found in the upper levelsof the remains of the Indus Culture, and at this period iron implements wererare, even in the advanced civilizations of Mesopotamia. Iron ore iscommon enough, but its smelting demands higher skill than the Aryans haddeveloped. At the time of the composition of the Ṛ g Veda the process ofsmelting iron was hardly known outside Anatolia, where the Hittite kingstried to keep it a secret. Only at the very end of the 2nd millennium did theuse of iron begin to spread widely over the civilized world, and it is veryunlikely that it had reached India by this time. 12As might be expected of a people without cities, the Aryans did not havean advanced economic system. In Mesopotamia the silver shekel, thoughunstamped, served as a means of exchange, but the Aryans relied for theirunit of value and means of barter on the unwieldy cow. The niska, a termlater used for a gold coin, is also mentioned as a sort of currency, but at thistime was probably a gold [Page 38] ornament of some kind. There is noevidence of a regular class of merchants or moneylenders, thoughindebtedness is sometimes referred to.The religion of the early Aryans, about which we know much more thanwe do about their everyday life and customs, will be discussed in a laterchapter (p.232 ff).

## THE LATER VEDIC AGE
Between the composition of the Ṛ g Veda and the age of the Buddha, when we begin to trace the history of India with comparative clearness, a period of some four or five hundred years elapsed. During this time the Aryans pushed eastwards down the Ganges, and their culture adapted itself to changed conditions. Very recently Indian archæologists have excavated asite which belongs to this period, that of the ancient city of Hastin?pura, thelowest level of which has been reasonably fixed at between 1000 and 700B.C., the time of the later Vedas. 13 The town was almost completelydestroyed by flood at the end of its existence, and little remains but sherdsof painted grey pottery, a few copper implements, and traces of houses ofunbaked brick. The typical pottery has been found from the Sarasvatī Valleyin the west to Ahicchatr?, near the upper Ganges, in the east. With theseexceptions we have scarcely any direct knowledge of the period, and oursources are still almost entirely sacred texts, the later Vedas, brāhmanas andUpanisads, which will be treated elsewhere from a religious and literarypoint of view (p. 241 ff).Besides these contemporary documents there are many legends containedin other sources, notably the Epics and Pur?nas, which seem to refer to thisperiod; but these are so overlaid by the accretions of later centuries that noattempt at interpreting them historically has so far won general acceptance,and it may never be possible to sift the fact from the fiction. Even the socialconditions described in the Epics, the stories of which may have beencomposed in a primitive form at this time, mainly refer not to this age, butto the obscure period between the Mauryan and Guptan Empires. Attemptsof some earlier authorities to create an “Epic Age” in the history of India, asdistinct from the age of the later Vedas, are quite unconvincing. There wasno Epic Age, and for our knowledge of this period we may only rely on theliterature of the period itself. This, like the Ṛ g Veda, is wholly religious, andtells us little more than the older source about the history of the time.One event, not definitely recorded in these contemporary sources, but sostrongly remembered that it must have been very important, [Page 39] wasthe great battle of Kuruksetra, not far from the modern Delhi. This battle,magnified to titanic proportions, formed the basis of the story of the greatestof India’s epics, the Mahābhārata. According to the legend the whole ofIndia, from Sind to Assam and from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, tookpart in the war, which arose through a dynastic dispute in the great Kurutribe (p. 408). It is by no means certain that the war was in fact a civil one,and the story has been plausibly interpreted as a muddled recollection of theconquest of the Kurus by a tribe of Mongol type from the hills. Butcertainly a great war took place, and succeeding generations looked on it asmarking the end of an epoch. The names of many of the heroes of theMahābhārata may genuinely be those of contemporary chieftains, but wemust regretfully record that the story is of less use to the historian even thanthe Iliad, or most of the Norse and Irish saga literature. It compares better tothe Nibelungenlied, the product of an age very different from that which itpurports to describe, and the result of the assimilation of many diversemartial traditions. It is as futile to try to reconstruct the political and socialhistory of India in the loth century B.C. from the Mahābhārata as it wouldbe to write the history of Britain immediately after the evacuation of theRomans from Malory’s Morte d’Arthur.According to the most popular later tradition the Mahabharata War tookplace in 5102 B.C., which, in the light of all evidence, is quite impossible.

More reasonable is another tradition, placing it in the 15th century B.C., but this is also several centuries too early in the light of our Archæological knowledge. Probably the war took place around the beginning of the 9th century B.C.; such a date seems to fit well with the scanty archæological remains of the period, and there is some evidence in the brāhmana literatureitself to show that it cannot have been much earlier. 14 From this timeonwards the centre of culture and political power shifted to the GangeticDoāb and the Kuru capital, Hastināpura or Āsandīvant. Throughout most ofthe later Vedic period the Kurus and their neighbours the Panicalas were thegreatest and the most civilized of Indian peoples. The names of severalKuru kings have been passed down in legend and two at any rate, Pariksitand Janamejaya, are mentioned in the literature of the time as mightyconquerors.Early in this period the Aryans pressed further eastward, and set upkingdoms in Kosala, to the east of the Doāb, and in Kāsī, the region ofBanaras. The former, which grew in importance with time, was the realm ofRāma, the hero of the second of the great Indian epics, the Rāmāyana (p.412f). For all his later fame the literature of the period ignores Rama andhis father Dasaratha completely, so we must [Page 40] conclude that theywere both comparatively insignificant chieftains, whose exploits were bychance remembered, to be elaborated and magnified by later generations ofbards until, around the beginning of the Christian Era, they received theirfinal form. It is not even certain that Rama was a king of Kosala at all, forthe earliest version of the legend that we possess makes him a king ofBanaras, which was for a time a kingdom of some importance, but wasconquered by Kosala towards the end of this period.Another important kingdom was Videha, to the east of the River Gandakand north of the Ganges. One of the Brāhmanas15 tells that once the fire-god Agni moved eastwards, burning up the earth, until he came to the RiverSadanira (the modern Gandak), where he stopped. In his wake followed achieftain from the Sarasvati, Videgha Mathava. Before his arrival no Āryanwould cross the river, because the purifying fire-god had not burnt the landon its eastern bank; but Agni instructed Mathava to carry him over, and thusthe land of Videha was Aryanized, and took its name from that of its firstcolonizer. The legend is important because it is the only significant accountof the process of colonization in an approximately contemporary source. Inthe progress of Agni, burning up the earth, we see not only the gradualeastward expansion of the Āryan fire cult, but also the clearing of jungleand waste by burning, as bands of migrating warrior peasants founded newsettlements.Though Rāma is ignored in the literature of the period his tradiionalfather-in-law, Janaka, king of Videha, is more than once mentioned and isclearly a historical figure. He was a great patron of the hermits andwandering philosophers who propagated the new mystical doctrines of theUpanisads, and himself took part in their discussions. By the time of theBuddha the kingdom of Janaka had disappeared, and his capital city,Mithila, had lost its importance. The kingdom was replaced by the tribalconfederacy of the Vrjjis, headed by the Licchavis, who may have beenMongols from the hills, but were perhaps a second wave of Árynimmigrants.South of Videha, on the right bank of the Ganges, was the region knownas Magadha, then of little account. It was not wholly Āryanized, but bandsof nomadic renegade Āryans called vrātyas, who did not follow the Vedicrites, roamed the land with their flocks and herds. Only in the time of theBuddha, under the great king Bimbisāra, did Magadha begin to show theenergy and initiative which were to lead to the setting up of the first greatIndian empire. To the east of Magadha, on the borders of the modernBengal, the small kingdom of Anga had arisen, while, beyond Auga, Bengaland Assam were still outside the pale.

Thus the texts of the period are mainly concerned with the region from the Jamnā eastwards to the borders of Bengal. The area south of the Ganges receives little attention, and it has been reasonably suggested that the main line of Āryan penetration was not down the river, the banks of which were then probably thick swampy jungle, but along the Himalayan foothills.  Expansion was not wholly confined to the north of the Ganges, however.

Contemporary literature has little to say about the rest of Northern India, but conditions at the time of the Buddha were such that it must have beencolonized some time previously, and this is confirmed by tradition. On theJamnā the tribe of the Yadavas had settled in the region of Mathurā, whilefurther down the river the kingdom of Vatsa was ruled from its capital ofKausambl, very important in later times. By the end of this period theAryans had advanced down the Chambal River, had settled in Malwa, andhad reached the Narmada. Probably parts of the N.-W. Deccan were alsounder Āryan influence. According to the Epic tradition Kathiawar wascolonized by a branch of the Yadavas, led by the great hero Krsna, and,though the association of Krsna with the story is probably unhistorical (p.  304f), the legend may be founded on fact.

While the Aryans had by now expanded far into India their old home in the Panjāb and the North-West was practically forgotten. Later Vedic literature mentions it rarely, and then usually with disparagement and contempt, as an impure land where the Vedic sacrifices are not performed.

It may have been once more invaded by Indo-Iranian tribes who did not follow the orthodox rites.

The culture of the later Vedic period was materially much in advance of that of the Ṛ g Veda. The Āryan tribes were by now consolidated in little kingdoms, which had not wholly lost their tribal character, but had permanent capitals and a rudimentary administrative system. The old tribal assemblies are still from time to time referred to, but their power was waning rapidly, and by the end of this period the king’s autocracy was in most cases only limited by the power of the brahmans, the weight oftradition, and the force of public opinion, which was always of someinfluence in ancient India. Here and there the old tribal organizationsucceeded in adapting itself to the changed conditions, and ganas, or tribalrepublics, survived for many centuries in outlying districts; but politicaldivisions based on kinship were giving place to those based on geography,and in many parts of India the tribes were rapidly breaking up. This, and thestrong feeling of insecurity which it caused, may have been an importantfactor in the growth of asceticism and of a pessimistic outlook on the world,which is evident throughout this period.

[Page 42] If the popular assemblies had lost power, another element inthe state was rising in influence-the ratnins, or “jewel bearers”, therelatives, courtiers and palace officials of the king, who were looked on asso important that at the king’s consecration special sacrifices wereperformed to ensure their loyalty. The list of ratnins includes the purohita,or chief priest of the palace, the general, the chamberlain, the king’scharioteer, and various other influential palace servants. Two of the ratnins,the samgrahītr and bhāgadugha, have been dubiously explained astreasurer and revenue-collector respectively, and if these interpretations arecorrect they indicate a rudimentary ministerial system and civil service.The period saw a great development of the sacrificial cult, which tookplace pari passu with rising royal pretensions. Much of the brāhmanaliterature is devoted to instructions for the meticulous performance of newroyal sacrifices, not mentioned in the Ṛ g Veda; among these were thelengthy rājasūya, or royal consecration, and the vājapeya, or “drink ofstrength”, a sort of rejuvenation ceremony, which not only restored the vitalforces of a middle-aged king, but raised him from the status of a simple rajato that of a samrāt, a complete monarch free of all allegiance and withlesser kings subordinate to him. Most famous and significant of all the newsacrifices was the aśvamedha, or horse-sacrifice, wherein a speciallyconsecrated horse was set free to roam at will for a year, followed by achosen band of warriors. Chieftains and kings on whose territory the horsewandered were forced to do homage or fight, and if it was not captured by aneighbouring king it was brought back to the capital and sacrificed at theend of the year. It was the ambition of every important king to perform ahorse-sacrifice, and the evil effects of the sacrifice on inter-state relationswere felt to the end of the Hindu period.By now the Aryans had nearly all the equipment of a civilization of theancient type. Where the Ṛ g Veda speaks only of gold and copper or bronzethe later Vedic texts also mention tin, lead, and silver, and probably iron.2The elephant was tamed, though little used in war. The Aryans nowcultivated a large range of crops, including rice, and they understoodsomething of irrigation and manuring.Specialized trades and crafts had appeared. In place of the fewoccupations in the Yajur Veda many are now referred to, includingjewellers, goldsmiths, metal-workers, basketmakers, ropemakers, [Page 43]weavers, dyers, carpenters and potters. Various types of domestic servantare mentioned, and a rudimentary entertainment industry existed, withprofessional acrobats, fortune-tellers, fluteplayers and dancers, while thereare also references to usurers and merchants.Though Āryan culture had by now made great advances there is still nomention of coined money or writing, both of which were certainly used inIndia before the time of the Mauryas. Coinage may have been introducedtowards the end of the 6th century B.C., through Persian influence, but it isnot completely certain that we can accept the negative evidence of laterVedic literature to show that writing was wholly unknown. This literaturewas intended for a limited audience of priests, who had developed a uniquesystem of memory training, and who may well have looked on writing as anobjectionable innovation. There is evidence in the literature itself of faintcontacts with Mesopotamia, notably in the Indian flood legend (p. 302),which first appears at this time, and bears some similarity to that ofBabylon. After a break of many centuries Indian merchandise was againfinding its way to Mesopotamia, and it is possible that Semitic merchants,or Indian merchants returning from the West, brought an alphabetic systemof writing, which was gradually taken up by the learned, and adapted to thephonetics of Indian speech, to become the Brāhmi script of Mauryan times(p. 394f).

The most important developments of this age were religious, and will beconsidered elsewhere (p. 242ff). Culturally the period of the later Vedicliterature saw Indian life and thought take the direction which it hasfollowed ever since. The end of this shadowy age, with its kings growing inpower, its priests arrogating to themselves ever greater privileges, and itsreligious outlook rapidly changing, marks the beginning of the great periodof India’s culture in which the pattern of her society, religion, literature andart gradually assumed something of its present shape.

1The horns of the “Proto-Śiva” are evidently those of a buffalo.

2“Black bronze” is referred to in the Yajur Veda, but no iron has been discovered in the remains of Hastinapura at this level. Iron was probably a comparatively rare metal until Mauryan times.

HISTORY: ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL
EMPIRES


## SOURCES OF HISTORY
[Page 44]
AT the courts of ancient Indian kings careful records were kept of the events of chief importance to the state, but unfortunately these archives are completely lost to us. In the 12th century A.D. a Kashmiri poet, Kalhana, thought fit to write the history of his native land in verse, but his “River ofKings” ( Rajatarangimni), although of great value for the study of thehistory of Kashmir, has little to tell us about India as a whole, and there isno real evidence that similar chronicles were composed elsewhere. TheCeylon Chronicle (Mahavamsa)isprimarily a history of Buddhism inCeylon, though it gives reliable information on political history. It isperhaps unjust to maintain that India had nosenseofhistorywhatever,butwhatinterest she had in her own past was generally concentrated on thefabulous kings of a legendary golden age, rather than the great empireswhichhadrisenandfalleninhistoricaltimes.Thus our knowledge of the political history of ancient India is often tantalizingly vague and uncertain, and that of the medieval period, which we may take as beginning in the 7thcentury A.D., is but little more precise.History must be pieced together from passing references in texts bothreligious and secular, from a few dramas and works of fiction purporting todescribe historical events, from the records of foreign travellers, and fromthe many panegyrics or other references to reigning monarchs and theirancestors which have been found engraved on rocks, pillars and templewalls, or incorporated as preambles to the title-deeds of land grants; thelatter, fortunately for the historian, were usually engraved on copper plates(pl.LXXXIX). The early history of India resembles a jigsaw puzzle withmany missing pieces; some parts of the picture are fairly clear; others maybe reconstructed with the aid of a controlled imagination; but many gapsremain, and may never be filled. Few dates before the middle ages can befixed with certainty, and the history of Hindu India, as far as we canreconstruct it, is almost completely lacking in the interesting anecdotes andvivid personalities which enliven the study of history for professional andamateur historians alike. Moreover there is much disagreement amongcompetent authorities on many important topics.[Page 45] As our knowledge is so vague and unsatisfactory the readermay well suggest that the political history of Hindu India should be left tothe expert; here, however, we cannot agree with him. Too many Indologistshave studied Indian religion, art, language and literature in a political andhistorical vacuum, and this has tended to encourage the widespread fallacythat ancient Indian civilization was interested almost solely in the things ofthe spirit. However defective our knowledge may be, we have ampleevidence to show that great empires rose and fell in India, and that, as inreligion, art, literature and social life, so in political organization Indiaproduced her own system, distinctive in its strength and weakness.Therefore some knowledge of her political history is essential for a trueunderstanding of her ancient civilization.

## THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA
It is in the 6th century B.C. that Indian history emerges from legend and dubious tradition. Now for the first time we read of great kings, whose historicity is certain, and some of whose achievements are known, and fromnow on the main lines of India’s political development are clear. Oursources for this period, the Buddhist and Jaina scriptures, are in manyrespects admittedly inadequate as historical documents. Their authors caredlittle for political affairs; like the Vedas, these texts were passed down byword of mouth for centuries, but, unlike the Vedas, they evidently grew andaltered with time. Yet they contain authentic reminiscences of historicalevents, and, though composed independently in different languages, theypartially confirm one another.The age in which true history appears in India was one of greatintellectual and spiritual ferment. Mystics and sophists of all kinds roamedthroughout the Ganges Valley, all advocating some form of mentaldiscipline and asceticism as a means to salvation; but the age of theBuddha, when many of the best minds were abandoning their homes andprofessions for a life of asceticism, was also a time of advance in commerceand politics. It produced not only philosophers and ascetics, but merchantprinces and men of action.By now the focus of civilization had shifted eastwards, and four greatkingdoms, outside the earlier area of brahmanic culture, had eclipsed theold land of the Kurus in both political and economic importance; these wereKosala, Magadha, Vatsa and Avanti, of which the first three have beenlocated in the last chapter and the fourth was approximately equivalent tothe region later known as Malwa. Of the four we know most about Kosalaand Magadha, the chief scenes [Page 46] of the activities of the Buddha andof Mahavira, the founder of Jainism. Kosala, the home of the legendaryRama, was already in decline. Her king, Prasenajit (in Pali, Pasenadi), wasindeed still a mighty monarch, ruling an area little smaller than France; butfrom fleeting references in the Buddhist scriptures it seems that he wasinefficient, and squandered his time and wealth on holy-men, both orthodoxand heretical. His kingdom, which was infested by robbers, was looselycontrolled through tribal chieftains and vassal kings.Bimbisara of Magadha, on the other hand, was a man of a differentstamp. The sources show us a resolute and energetic organizer, ruthlesslydismissing inefficient officers, calling his village headmen together forconferences, building roads and causeways, and travelling over his kingdomon tours of inspection. In general he seems to have been a man of peace,and to have kept on good terms with the kingdoms to the west of him,exchanging courtesies even with the king of far-off Gandhāra on the upperIndus. His one conquest was that of the little kingdom of Afiga, on theborders of the modem Bengal. Campa, the capital city of Afga, was alreadyof considerable commercial importance, for it was a river port from whichships would sail down the Ganges and coast to South India, returning withjewels and spices which were already much in demand in the North.Although Afiga was Bimbisara’s only conquest, he seems also to havegained control of part at least of the district of Kasi(Banaras),asthedowryofhis chief queen, who was the sister of Prasenajit of Kosala. His capitalwas Rajagrha, some sixty miles to the south-east of the moder Patna.Bimbisara was deposed, imprisoned and murdered about 490 B.C.-someseven years before the death of the Buddha-by his son, Ajatagatru. Soonafter usurping the prosperous kingdom built up by his father, the parricidewent to war with his aged uncle Prasenajit, and gained complete control ofKaii. Just after this Prasenajit, like Bimbisara, was deposed by his son, anddied. The new king, Virudhaka (in Pali, Vidudabha), then attacked andvirtually annihilated the little autonomous tribe of the Sakyas, in theHimalayan foothills, and we hear no more of the people which produced thegreatest of Indians, the Buddha. Probably Virudhaka, like Ajatagatru ofMagadha, had ambitions of empire, and wished to embark on a career ofconquest after bringing the outlying peoples, who had paid loose homage tohis father, more directly under the control of the centre; but his intentionswere unfulfilled, for we hear no more of him except an unreliable legendthat he was destroyed by a miracle soon after his massacre of the Sakyas. Alittle later his kingdom was incorporated in that of Magadha.[Page 47] After his war with Prasenajit Ajatagatru turned his attention tothe tribal confederation of the Vrjjis, on the north bank of the Ganges,which had often caused trouble by raiding Magadhan territory. After aprotracted war he succeeded in occupying their chief city, Vaigali, and inannexing their lands. The chief element of the confederation, the tribe of theLicchavis, succeeded in preserving its identity, however, and survived atleast until the 4th century A.D., when it was again influential in the politicsof Eastern India. The early stages of Ajatasatru’s war with the Vrjjis tookplace around the time of the Buddha’s death, in about 483 B.C.The accounts of the reigns of Bimbisara and Ajatagatru give evidence ofa definite policy, aimed at the control of as much of the course of theGanges as possible. It seems that they were the first Indian kings toconceive the possibility of a far-flung empire. Legend indeed tells of earlieremperors who controlled the whole land from coast to coast, but these veryshadowy figures are almost certainly the exaggerations of later story-tellers,inspired by the memory of the mighty Mauryas. There is little doubt that thelegendary emperors, such as Rama, do represent historical figures of thedays before the Buddha, but they were probably small tribal chieftains onlypowerful in comparison with their fellows. For the tradition of theirimmense conquests we have no historical evidence whatever.If there was any source of the inspiration of the two great kings ofMagadha it must have been the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, whosefounder, Cyrus the Great (558–550 B.C.), came to the throne about sixteenyears before the accession of Bimbisara, and proceeded rapidly to build upthe greatest empire the world had then seen. At this time the city ofTaksagila, in the North-West, was already a centre of learning and trade.

Young men from Magadha were sent there to finish their education, and Bimbisara was in diplomatic contact with Puskarasarin (in Pali, Pukkusati),king of Gandhāra, whose kingdom probably included Takjasila. But in aninscription of about 519 B.C. Darius I, the third of the Achaemenidemperors, claims possession of Gandhāra, and in a slightly later one he alsoclaims Hindush, or “India”, which, according to Herodotus, became thetwentieth satrapy of the Persian Empire. The extent of the Persian provinceof Hindush is not certain, but it probably included much of the Panjāb. It ishardly likely that the kings of Magadha were ignorant of what washappening in the North-West; we believe that their expansionist policy wasin part inspired by the example of the Persians.

The Buddhist and Jaina scriptures give us little information on the [Page 48] events which took place after the deaths of their founders, and therefore we know scarcely anything about the latter part of Ajatasatru’s reign. There is evidence that he fought Pradyota, king of Avanti, and that for a time at least the fortunes of war did not favour him; but he certainly succeeded increating the most powerful empire India had yet known, controlling bothbanks of the Ganges from Banaras to the borders of Bengal, which was thenstill beyond the pale of Aryan civilization. In the succeeding century and ahalf Magadha continued to expand, for, when the curtain is again lifted onIndia’s past in the 4th century B.C., Pataliputra (now Patna), the new capitalof Magadha, controls all the Ganges basin; the rest of Northern India, withthe exception of Rajasthan, Sind, Panjāb and the NorthWest, is part of theMagadhan Empire, and the other kingdoms are either annihilated or reducedto insignificant vassalage.

## ALEXANDER AND THE MAURYAS
In the middle of the 4th century B.C., Mahapadma Nanda was emperor of Magadha. He was an unpopular upstart, but, as far as can be gathered from the few references to him, he was an energetic and ambitious king, who succeeded in gaining control of Kalifiga (the modern Orissā and the northern coastal strip of Andhra), and perhaps of other parts of the Deccan.

His death seems to have been followed by a disputed succession, which coincided with important events in the North-West. Out of the confusion of the times emerged the greatest and most powerful of India’s many empires. In 330 B.C. Alexander of Macedon defeated Darius III, the last of theAchaemenids, and set out to subdue the whole of the former PersianEmpire, which had long ceased to exercise effective control over its remoterprovinces. In the decisive battle of Gaugamela Alexander had already metIndian troops, for a small contingent of soldiers from the west of the Indus,with fifteen elephants, had fought with Darius. Over a hundred years earlierGreeks had already measured swords with Indians, for, according toHerodotus, a detachment of Indians fought in the Persian army at Plataea.After a long campaign in Bactria, the region on the borders of the modernSoviet Union and Afghanistan watered by the River Oxus, Alexandercrossed the Hindu Kush and occupied the district of Kabul. Then, fiercelybut unsuccessfully resisted by the hillmen, he descended the Kabul Valleyand reached the Indus, which he crossed in the spring of 326. Omphis,1 kingof Taksagila (known to classical [Page 49] writers as Taxila), had alreadysubmitted, and the city offered no resistance. Beyond the Jhelam, however,lay the territory of the most warlike king of the Panjāb, Porus, 2 for fear ofwhom Omphis had willingly thrown in his lot with Alexander. It was onlywith great difficulty, after a surprise crossing of the Jhelam, that theMacedonians succeeded in defeating the troops of Porus, who was captured.

Porus was a very tall and handsome man, whose courage and proud bearing made a great impression on the Greeks; when brought before his conquerorhe was found to have received nine wounds, and he could barely stand; butwhen Alexander asked him how he wished to be treated he boldly replied:“As befits me-like a kingl” Alexander was so impressed by his captive thathe restored him to his kingdom as a vassal and, on the retreat of the Greekforces, left him in charge of the Panjāb.After the defeat of Porus Alexander continued his advance, subduingnumerous tribes and petty kingdoms; but at the Beas he was forced to turnback, for his generals feared mutiny if his troops were made to advancefurther into unknown country. Alexander returned across the Panjāb andfought his way down the Indus, often meeting stiff opposition from themartial tribes. At the mouth of the Indus the army divided, part returning toMesopotamia by sea, and part, led by Alexander himself, by land, followingthe coast through the desolate Makran. After much hardship bothdetachments reached the Euphrates, together with a smaller body which hadbeen sent back earlier by way of Arachosia (the moder Kandahar). There isno doubt that Alexander intended to retain control of his Indian conquests,for he left garrisons behind him and appointed satraps to govern theconquered territories. But revolts in the Indian provinces and the suddendeath of Alexander in 323 B.C. made the Macedonian position in Indiauntenable, and the last of Alexander’s generals, Eudamus, left the North-West in 317.Although the Greeks had known something of India before the invasionof Alexander, their knowledge was mostly of the nature of fantastictravellers’ tales. Now for the first time Greeks and Indians came into closecontact. It is clear from classical accounts of Alexander’s campaign that theGreeks were not unimpressed by what they saw of India. They muchadmired the courage of the Indian troops, the austerity of the naked asceticswhom they met at Taksasila, and the probity and simplicity of the tribes ofthe Panjāb and Sind.The immediate effects of the invasion were slight. The little kingdomsand tribes of the North-West were disorganized and [Page 50] overthrown,but Alexander made so small an impression upon India that in the whole ofher surviving ancient literature there is no reference to him. In latercenturies the Indians came to know the Greeks, but of Greek influence inIndia at this time there is scarcely a trace. However, it may be that theinvasion, and the political vacuum created in the North-West byAlexander’s retreat, had indirect effects of the utmost importance.

Classical sources speak of a young Indian named Sandrocottus — identical with the Candragupta Maurya of Indian sources-who supported the invaders. Plutarch states that Sandrocottus advised Alexander to advancebeyond the Beds and attack the Nanda emperor, who was so unpopular thathis people would rise in support of an invader. The Latin historian Justinadds that later Sandrocottus offended Alexander by his boldness of speech,and that the conqueror ordered that he should be put to death; but heescaped, and, after many adventures, succeeded in expelling the Greekgarrisons and gaining the throne of India. Whether or not these stories aretrue, it is reasonable to believe that the emperor Candragupta Maurya, whorose to power soon after Alexander’s invasion, had at least heard of theconqueror, and perhaps derived inspiration from his exploits.

Both Indian and classical sources agree that Candragupta overthrew thelast of the Nandas and occupied his capital, Pataliputra; the latter add thatafter Alexander’s retreat Candragupta subdued the North-West, driving outthe Greek garrisons. It is not clear which of these operations was firstundertaken, and, with the annoying uncertainty of much ancient Indianhistory, estimates of the date of Candragupta’s accession vary within adecade (324–313 B.C.); but though the detailed history of his rise to power isuncertain, it is evident that he was the chief architect of the greatest ofIndia’s ancient empires. According to all Indian traditions he was muchaided in his conquests by a very able and unscrupulous brahman adviser,called variously Kautilya, Canakya and Visnugupta; indeed in the play TheMinister’s Signet Ring, a work of the 6th century A.D., which purports todescribe the last stages of Candragupta’s triumph over the Nanda (p. 441),the king is depicted as a weak and insignificant young man, the real ruler ofthe empire being Canakya. The minister is the reputed author oftheArthasastra, or “Treatise on Polity”, a very valuable source of informationon state administration. The text as we have it at present is certainly not thework of Kautilya (p. 79), but it isvery valuable nevertheless, and containsgenuine Mauryan reminiscences.Soon the Greeks were again at the doors of India. Alexander’s [Page 51]general Seleucus Nicator had succeeded in gaining control of most of theAsiatic provinces of the shortlived Macedonian Empire, and turned hisattention to the East. About 305 B.C. he met Candragupta in battle, andseems to have suffered the worst of the engagement, for not only did he failin his attempt to recover Alexander’s Indian provinces, but he wascompelled to yield parts of what is now Afghanistan to Candragupta,receiving in exchange only 500 elephants. The peace was concluded by amatrimonial alliance, the exact nature of which is uncertain;1 but it is notimpossible that the successors of Candragupta had Greek blood in theirveins.Seleucus sent an ambassador, Megasthenes, to reside at the Mauryancourt at Pataliputra, and the envoy wrote a detailed account of India whichbecame the standard textbook on the subject for later classical writers.Unfortunately no manuscript of Megasthenes’ description of India hassurvived, but many Greek and Latin authors made abundant use of it, andfrom their works it may be partially reconstructed. The record ofMegasthenes, though by no means as complete and accurate as might bewished, is of great importance as the first authentic and connecteddescription of India by a foreign traveller. It is evident from a comparisonof the fragments of Megasthenes with the Arthasastra that the Mauryanempire had developed a highly organized bureaucratic administration,which controlled the whole economic life of the state, and that it had a verythorough secret service system, which was active among all classes fromthe highest ministers to the submerged tenth of the towns.Megasthenes much admired the Emperor Candragupta for his energeticadministration of justice, which he presided over personally in opendarbār.3 He dwelt in great luxury in an enormous palace at Pataliputra,which, though built wholly of wood, was of unbelievable beauty andsplendour; but his life was not a happy one, for he was in constant fear ofassassination, an ever-present danger to many Indian kings, and verystringent precautions were taken for his security. The capital was a largeand fine city, surrounded by a wooden wall; it was controlled by anadministrative board of thirty members, who regulated in detail the wholesocial and economic life of the city. Megasthenes noticed the existence ofcaste, though his classification of the population in seven endogamousgroups is certainly erroneous (p. 147).According to Jaina tradition Candragupta abdicated the throne, became aJaina monk, and fasted to death, in the manner of Jaina [Page 53] saints, atthe great Jaina temple and monastery of Sravana Belgola, in the modemMysore. Whether or not this legend be true, he was succeeded after a reignof twenty-four years by his son Bindusara, about whom little is knownexcept that he was in touch with Antiochus I, the Seleucid king of Syria.

According to Athenaeus, Bindusara requested of the Greek king a presentof figs and wine, together with a sophist. Antiochus sent the figs and wine,but replied that Greek philosophers were not for export. This quaint littlestory seems to indicate that Bindusara, like many other Indian kings, sharedhis attentions between creature comforts and philosophy, but he wascertainly energetic enough to hold the great empire intact, and it is evenprobable that he added to it in the Deccan. He was succeeded, about 269B.C., probably after a short interregnum, by his son Asoka, the greatest andnoblest ruler India has known, and indeed one of the great kings of theworld.

## The Empire of Asoka
(The pillars originally at Mirath and Topra are now at Delhi) According to Buddhist sources Agoka usurped the throne, killed all possible rivals, and began his reign as a tyrant, but this story is not borne out by Agoka’s own inscriptions, which are the oldest surviving Indian written documents of any historical significance. They consist of a series ofedicts engraved in very similar form on rocks and pillars at widely scatteredpoints all over India (fig. vi), and form a unique monument to a great king’smemory. The edicts are in part inspired by Achaemenid precedent, but theircontents are very different from the great inscriptions of Darius I, forinstance, which glorify the emperor, catalogue his conquests, and enumeratethe peoples and tribes under his sway. Asoka’s edicts are in the nature ofofficial pronouncements of policy, and instructions to his officers andsubjects. They contain many personal touches, and the drafts were probablywritten by the emperor himself.

They tell us that when the king had been consecrated eight years heunderwent a complete change of heart, and embarked on a new policy. InAsoka’s own words:“When the King, of Gracious Mien and Beloved of the Gods, had beenconsecrated eight years Kaliiga was conquered. 150,000 people were thencetaken captive, 100,000 were killed, and many more died. Just after thetaking of Kalifiga the Beloved of the Gods began to follow Righteousness,to love Righteousness, to give instruction in Righteousness. When anunconquered country is conquered, people are killed, they die, or are madecaptive. That the Beloved of the Gods finds very pitiful and grievous. …Today, if a hundredth or a thousandth part of those who suffered in Kaliigawere to be killed, to die, or to be taken captive, it would be very grievous tothe Beloved of the Gods. If anyone does him wrong it will be forgiven asfar as it can be forgiven. The Beloved of the Gods even reasons with the[Page 54] forest tribes in his empire, and seeks to reform them. But theBeloved of the Gods is not only compassionate, he is also powerful, and hetells them to repent, lest they be slain. For the Beloved of the Gods desiressafety, self-control, justice and happiness for all beings. The Beloved of theGods considers that the greatest of all victories is the victory ofRighteousness, and that [victory] the Beloved of the Gods has already won,here and on all his borders, even 600 leagues away in the realm of theGreek king Antiyoka, and beyond Antiyoka among the four kingsTuramaya, Antikini, Maga and Alikasudara, and in the South among theCōlas and Pandyas and as far as Ceylon.“2Thus we see that the keynote of ASoka’s reform was humanity in internaladministration and the abandonment of aggressive war. In place of thetraditional policy of territorial expansion he substituted conquest byRighteousness (as we here inadequately translate the very pregnant worddharma). He claims to have won many victories by this method, evenamong the five Hellenic kings whose names, loosely disguised byIndianization, are to be read in the above extract-Antiochus II Theos ofSyria, Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt, Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia,Magas of Cyrene and Alexander of Epirus. It seems that Asoka believedthat, by setting an example of enlightened government, he might convincehis neighbours of the merits of his new policy and thus gain the moralleadership of the whole civilized world. He by no means gave up hisimperial ambitions, but modified them in accordance with the humanitarianethics of Buddhism.In domestic affairs the new policy was felt in a general relaxation of thestern justice of earlier times. Asoka declared that all men were his children,and more than once reproved his local governors for their failure to applythis precept thoroughly. He strongly supported the doctrine of ahimsd (non-injury to men and animals), then rapidly spreading among religious peopleof all sects, banned animal sacrifices, at least in his capital, and regulatedthe slaughter of animals for food, completely forbidding the killing ofcertain species. He took pride in the fact that he had substituted pilgrimagesto Buddhist holy places for hunting expeditions, the traditional sport of theIndian king, and he proclaimed that he had reduced the consumption ofmeat in the palace to negligible proportions. Thus Asoka’s encouragementwas in part responsible for the growth of vegetarianism in India.From the passage above quoted, as well as from other indications, it isclear that Asoka was not a complete pacifist. The wild tribesmen of hill andforest were a constant source of danger to the more settled parts of theempire, and it would seem that earlier kings had [Page 55] kept them incheck by ruthless campaigns of extermination. Asoka clearly intended to tryto civilize them, but it is quite evident that he was ready to repress them byforce if they continued their raids on the more settled parts of his empire.

He made no mention of reducing the army, and if, under the influence of Buddhism, he had done so, he would surely have taken pride in the fact.Despite his remorse at the conquest of Kalifga, he was too much of a realistto restore it to its original rulers, whoever they may have been, butcontinued to govern it as an integral part of his empire. For all hishumanitarianism he maintained the death penalty, which was abolishedunder some later Indian kings, and merely granted a stay of execution ofthree days to men condemned to death, so that they might put their affairs inorder and prepare their minds for the next world. Though Buddhist traditionrecords that he abolished judicial torture, this is not clearly stated in hisedicts.Among his positive social services Agoka mentions the improvement ofcommunications by planting fruit trees along the roads to provide shade andfood, digging wells at intervals, and setting up rest-houses for wearytravellers. He developed the cultivation of medicinal herbs, which, withother drugs, were supplied to men and animals alike. To ensure that hisreforms were put into effect he inaugurated a new class of official, the“Officers of Righteousness” ( dharma-mahdmdtra), who, taking theirinstructions direct from the centre, were ordered to investigate the affairs ofall the provinces, to encourage good relations between man and man, and toensure that the local officials carried out the new policy. Thus Asoka’sreforms tended to centralization rather than devolution.It is evident that, after his change of heart if not before, Asoka was aBuddhist, and some authorities believe that he actually entered the Buddhistorder. But the inscriptions show that he was no metaphysician, and indeedhe probably had little interest in or understanding of the finer points ofBuddhism. Although he never mentions the Buddhist nirvana, he speaksfrequently of heaven; and he seems to have held the naive belief that, as aresult of the growth of morality through his reforms, the gods hadmanifested themselves on earth, a phenomenon which had not occurred formany years previously.3 For Agoka, Buddhism seems to have been a systemof morals which led to peace and fellowship in this world and heaven in thenext. His metaphysical presuppositions were not distinctively Buddhist, butwere evidently those traditional in India at the time. A streak of puritanismin the Emperor is to be inferred from the edict banning rowdy popular fairsand allowing religious gatherings only.

Aśoka’s Buddhism, though enthusiastic, was not exclusive. More [Page 56] than once he declared that all sects were worthy of respect, and he dedicated artificial caves to the sect of Ajlvikas, who were among the chiefrivals of the Buddhists. His relations with the Buddhist clergy seem to havebeen erastian, for he had no compunction in prescribing passages ofscripture which the order was specially to study, and he instructed localofficers to ensure that all ill-behaved Buddhist monks were unfrocked. Itwas in Asoka’s reign that Buddhism ceased to be a simple Indian sect andbegan its career as a world religion. According to tradition a great councilof the Buddhist clergy was held at Pataliputra, at which the Pali canon wasfinally codified, and after which missions were sent throughout the lengthand breadth of India and beyond.

Tradition unanimously ascribes the conversion of Ceylon to Mahendra(in Pali, Mahinda), the son, or in some sources the brother, of Asoka, whohad become a Buddhist monk. Though the relationship of the apostle ofCeylon to Asoka is very doubtful, there can be no doubt of his historicity, orof that of King Devanampiya Tissa, his first convert. Though Aryans mayhave settled in Ceylon nearly three centuries before this time, it was nowthat the culture of the island began to develop, under the fertilizinginfluence of Buddhism. The Ceylon Chronicle, which, being nationalist inits sympathies, is not likely to be false in this particular, implicitly admitsthat Tissa was loosely subordinate to Asoka, since it states that heunderwent a second consecration and was converted to Buddhism onAsoka’s instructions. Thus at least one of Asoka’s “victories ofRighteousness” outside his empire was successful; his attempts at the moralconquest of the Hellenic kings certainly ended in failure, for there is noreference to his embassies in any classical source, and if they reached theirdestinations they can have had little effect on the ambitious successors ofAlexander.

To the modern student Agoka towers above the other kings of ancient India, if for no other reason than that he is the only one among them whose personality can be reconstructed with any degree of certainty. But even Asoka is not as clear a figure as we would wish, and his policy has been thesubject of varied judgements. Critics have accused him of ruining theMauryan Empire, either by antagonizing the brāhmans or by sapping themartial spirit of the ruling classes. 4 We cannot accept either of theseaccusations. It appears that the old Emperor, who died about 232 B.C.,somewhat lost grip in his latter years,5 and the succession was disputed byhis sons. The Empire began to fall apart on his death, when the governors ofthe great provinces, usually members of the royal family, established theirvirtual independence. The successors of [Page 57] Aśoka were lesser menthan he, and little is known of them but their names.

PLATE XII
The Asoka of the Buddhist legends is, in the words of a 19thcenturyauthority, “half monster and half idiot”,6 his humanity and practicalbenevolence overlaid by the accretion of monkish legends of later centuries;but the king of the rock and pillar inscriptions comes alive, as a real man,and a man far ahead of his times. Asoka was by no means an other-worldlydreamer, but every inch a king, a little naive, often rather self-righteous andpompous, but indefatigable, strong-willed and imperious. It is with goodreason that the Indian Republic has adopted for the device of its state sealthe capital of an Asokan column (pl. XXIII a).

## THE AGE OF INVASIONS
For some fifty years Mauryan kings continued to rule in Magadha until, about 183 B.C., Pusyamitra Śunga, a brahman general of Brhadratha, the lastMauryan king, succeeded in gaining power by a palace revolution.Pusyamitra was a supporter of the orthodox faith, and revived the ancientVedic sacrifices, including the horsesacrifice; but the flourishing state ofBuddhism at this period is attested by the remains at Bhārhut, and thestories of his persecution of Buddhist monks are probably muchexaggerated by sectarian tradition. The kingdom of the Sungas was by nomeans a closelyknit centralized empire, like that of the Mauryas, but one ofa looser type, which was to become normal in Hindu India, and which maybe broadly termed feudal (p. 93ff). Its centre was in Vidisa (E. Malwa),which at most times seems to have been directly controlled by the king,whose domains were surrounded by a circle of vassal states, small andgreat, in varying degrees of subservience, but some evidently autonomousenough to issue their own coins. Beyond the realm of Pusyamitra much ofthe old Mauryan Empire was now independent, and little is known of thecondition of Magadha, the former centre of culture and power.The inspiration of the Mauryas was soon almost forgotten. Later theGuptas tried to build an empire of a more centralized type, and directlycontrolled much of North India for over a hundred years, but, with thismajor exception and a few minor ones, all later Hindu imperialism was ofthe quasi-feudal type, loose and unstable. The memory of Asoka’srenunciation of further conquest was soon forgotten, and aggressive waragain became the sport of kings, and was looked upon by theorists as anormal activity of the state. In general the history of post-Mauryan India isone of the struggle of one [Page 58] dynasty with another for regionaldominance, and the political, though not the cultural, unity of India was lostfor nearly two thousand years.Pusyamitra is mentioned in several sources, and his name is recorded inone brief inscription, referring to an obscure descendant.7 He did not takeregal titles, but was throughout his reign referred to by the simple titlesendpati, or “general”. Agnimitra, his son, who seems to have been kingduring his father’s lifetime, is known from Kalidasa’s drama Mdlavikd andAgnimitra, while his grandson Vasumitra is recorded in the same source ashaving defeated the Greeks. An inscription on a column at Besnagar (pl. Xc), near Bhilsa, records that a Śunga king Bhāgabhadra received anambassador named Heliodorus from a Greek king of Taksaśilā, Antialcidas.Otherwise the Śungas are mere names, recorded, usually in garbled form,among the muddled king-lists of the Purānas, religious texts dating fromGupta times onwards.

Meanwhile events were taking place on India’s north-western borders which were to have a profound effect both on her own history and on that of Asia generally. A series of invasions, all inadequately documented, brought the whole of what is now West Pākistin, Malwa and Kathiāwār, much of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and even for a while part of the Western Deccan, under the control of alien kings.

The first invaders were the Bactrian Greeks. Small colonies of Asiatic Greeks had been settled in Bactria by the Achaemenids, and these werestrengthened by settlements established by Alexander and Seleucus Nicator.About the middle of the 3rd century B.C. Diodotus, the governor of Bactria,declared himself independent of the Seleucid Empire, and the Iranianprovince of Parthia became independent at about the same time. Diodotuswas succeeded by his son, also named Diodotus, who was soon overthrownand replaced by a usurper, Euthydemus. Euthydemus came to terms withthe Seleucid emperor, Antiochus III, who had vainly attempted to regain thelost province; now with his flank secure, he began to expand over the HinduKush, and gained a foothold on the N.-W. Frontier, which had probablyalready broken away from the Mauryan Empire. Demetrius, the son andsuccessor of Euthydemus, early in the 2nd century B.C. pressed further intoIndia. He and his successors occupied most of the Indus Valley and thePanjāb, and led great raids far into India, at least one of which, perhaps ledby King Menander, reached Pataliputra. Soon the home domains of theBactrian Greeks were wrested from them by another usurper, Eucratides,but descendants of Euthydemus continued to rule in the Panjāb and parts ofthe North-West. Then the Eucratids, too, were tempted to try their fortunesbeyond the mountains, and gained control of the Kabul [Page 59] Valleyand the district of Taksagila. The Greek domains in India were divided intoseveral petty kingdoms, those of the Kabul Valley and the N.-W. Frontierchiefly ruled by kings of the line of Eucratides, and those of the Panjābunder the line of Euthydemus.Little is known of the history of the Greeks in India, and their fortunescan only be faintly reconstructed from their remarkable coins (pl.LXXXIV), most of which bear legends in Greek on the obverse and inPrakrit on the reverse. From now on, however, the ravanas (a termborrowed by India through the Persian from the Greek) are mentioned fromtime to time in Indian literature. Through the Greco-Bactrian kingdomsWestern theories of astrology and medicine began to enter India, andperhaps the development of the Sanskrit drama was in part inspired fromthis source. More than one Indian tradition speaks of great Yavana raids.One of the Greek kings of the Panjāb is specially remembered byBuddhism, as the patron of the philosopher-monk Nagasena; this wasMilinda, or Menander, who ruled at gakāla (?Siālkot), and whose longdiscussions with the sage are recorded in a well known Pali text, theQuestions of Milinda. Menander is said to have become a Buddhist, but theBesnagar column, to which we have already referred, shows that the Greeksalso sometimes supported the orthodox creeds, for it was erected by theambassador Heliodorus in honour of the early Vaisnavite deity Vasudeva.Thus some of the Greeks, while not completely merging with the Indianpopulation, soon felt the influence of their ways of thought, and made manycompromises with their culture. The author of the law-book of Manu,writing probably a century or two later than Heliodorus, describes theYavanas as degenerate ksatriyas, or members of the warrior class, and thusgives them a place in Hindu society.

The Greco-Bactrian kingdoms, however, did not long survive. Bactria itself was occupied by the Parthians early in the second half of the 2nd century B.C., and the Greeks were confined to their possessions in India andAfghanistan. Then fresh invaders appeared from the north. A complexchain of causes, climatic and political, led to new movements of the peoplesof Central Asia. The consolidation of the Chinese Empire under the greatemperor Ch’in Shih Huang Ti (247–210 B.C.), and perhaps also the dryingup of their pasture lands, had driven large bands of nomads westwards,from the confines of China to the region east of the Caspian. Soon anomadic people, called by the Chinese Yieh-chih, was bearing heavily onthe Scythian tribesmen on the borders of Bactria. The Scyths, whom Indiawas to know as Sakas, were driven by pressure from the north and east to attack Bactria, which they occupied, soon to be followed by the [Page 60]Yiieh-chih. The Sakas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthianrulers of Iran, and then the Greeks in India. By the middle of the 1st centuryB.C. only a few petty Greek chiefs still ruled in India, and the power of thegakas reached as far as Mathurā. The gakas continued the earlier practice ofissuing coins with inscriptions in Greek and Prakrit. The earliest gaka kingknown to have ruled in India was Maues (? c. 80 B.C.).Towards the end of the 1st century B.C. a line of kings with Iraniannames, usually known as Pahlavas, gained the brief suzerainty of N.-W.India. One of them, Gondophernes, is worthy of mention, as the ruler towhose kingdom St. Thomas is said to have brought India’s first knowledgeof Christianity (p. 342). Some authorities have cast doubt on the truth of thelegend, maintaining that Gondophernes’ date was too early for him to havebeen St. Thomas’s contemporary;8 but at any rate he was important enoughfor his fame to reach the West, and that St. Thomas preached in India is byno means impossible.The Pahlavas were in turn conquered by the Yiieh-chih. The racialaffinities of these people are uncertain; physically they were of Turkishtype, but they perhaps spoke an Iranian language, like the Sakas. For acentury or more they dwelt in Bactria and the neighbouring regions ofCentral Asia, divided into autonomous tribes, until control was consolidatedin the hands of Kujula Kadphises, of the tribe of the Kusanas. At some timein the first half of the 1st century A.D. Kujila led his warriors over themountains, and he and his son Vima Kadphises between them gainedcontrol of N.-W. India. Kujula was perhaps responsible for the extinction ofthe last of the Greek kings, Hermaeus, whose line had held out in Kabulagainst the Sakas.Vima Kadphises was succeeded, probably after a short interregnum, byKaniska, who controlled all the western half of Northern India at least as faras Banaras, and whose dominions in Central Asia were very extensive. TheChinese annals speak of a Kusana king, either Kaniska or one of theKadphises, demanding the hand of a princess of the imperial house of Hanin marriage, and being soundly defeated for his arrogance by the greatgeneral Pan Ch’ao, who, at the end of the 1st century A.D., carried Chinesearms as far as the Caspian.This period was a very important one in the history of Buddhism, andKaniska is remembered in Northern Buddhist tradition as a great patron ofthe faith. Numerous remains testify to the importance and popularity ofBuddhism at the time, and it was now that it began to spread to Central Asiaand the Far East. Some intimations of the Indian religion had alreadyreached China, but it exerted no real influence until now, when the Kusanaand Chinese empires were in [Page 61] close contact. The period is alsonoteworthy for the Gandhāra school of art, which was influential not only inIndia but also, indirectly, in the Far East (p. 368f).Professor B.

Bashamb## The Caves of AjantaThe date of Kaniska, like the chronology of the whole gakaKusanaperiod, is very uncertain, and estimates of the year of his accession havevaried from 58 B.C. to A.D. 288. At present opinions of most competentauthorities are divided between A.D. 78 and 144. The former date is that ofthe foundation of one of the most widespread Indian systems of dating, laterknown as the gaka Era. Kaniska was not, strictly speaking, a gaka, but theterm was very loosely applied, and he is known to have founded an era.Though the date A.D. 78 fits well with other Indian evidence, certaincomplicated synchronisms mainly based on non-Indian sources suggest thathe reigned some decades later than this, and the question cannot be finallysettled until new evidence appears. The successors of Kaniska continued toreign in N.-W. India, but their empire was soon much reduced. About themiddle of the 3rd century Vasudeva, one of Kaniska’s successors, wassoundly defeated by Shapur I, of the new Sasanian dynasty of Persia, andfrom now on the North-West came much under Iranian influence.Meanwhile new kingdoms had been set up in the Peninsula. In Orissa agreat conqueror, Kharavela, appeared about the middle of the 1st centuryB.C.; he raided far and wide over India and was a great patron of Jainism;but his empire was short-lived, and we know nothing of his successors. Atabout the same time an important kingdom arose in the N.-W. Deccan fromthe ruins of that of the Mauryas-the kingdom of the Satavahanas orAndhras, centred on Pratisthana (modern Paithan). This survived for 300years or more, until the 5rd century A.D., its power often reaching beyondthe Narmada into Malwa and, in the 2nd century A.D., from coast to coast.Traditionally the first Sātavāhana king, Simuka, put an end to the lastinsignificant unfigas and to the Kanva kings, who reigned for a short timein part of the old unfiga Empire. For a while, around the beginning of the2nd century A.D., the Satavahanas were driven from the N.-W. Deccan byinvading gakas of the clanof Ksaharata, whose great satrap Nahapana left anumber of inscriptions; but the Satavahanas, under the greatest of theirrulers, Gautamiputra Satakarnin, recovered their landsaboutA.D. 130, andnothing more is heard of the Ksaharatas.Another gaka dynasty, generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gainedcontrol of Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled untilsoon after A.D. 388, at its height governing much of Rajasthan and Sind. Thegreatest ruler of this line [Page 62] was Rudradaman, who has left theearliest important inscription in correct Sanskrit, a long panegyric whichrecords his martial exploits and his reconstruction of a great artificial lake atGirnar in Kathiawar, which had been excavated under Candragupta andimproved in the time of Asoka. This inscription is among the earliestcertainly dated records of ancient India, and proves that Rudradaman wasreigning in A.D. 150.At this time the Dravidian South first begins to appear in the light ofhistory. Traditionally the Tamil country has always been divided into threekingdoms-C6la (the Coromandel Coast), Kerala or Cera (Malabar), andPandya (the southern tip of the Peninsula). These three are mentioned byAsoka as the scenes of his “victories of Righteousness” beyond his owndominions, and a few rough inscriptions indicate that Buddhist and Jainaascetics visited the Tamil land before the beginning of the Christian era. Inthe earliest stratum of Tamil literature, which was probably composed in theearly centuries A.D., we find the three kingdoms in a state of almostcontinual warfare. Their kings, and the numerous lesser chieftains who arealso mentioned, seem to have been more bloodthirsty than those of theNorth, and the literature contains hints of massacres and other atrocitiessuch as are rarely heard of in Sanskrit literature; one passage even suggestscannibal feasts after battle. 9 The ancient Tamil, by no means perfectlyAryanized, was a man of very different stamp from his gentle andthoughtful descendant. Wild and ruthless, delighting in war and drink,worshipping fierce gods with bacchanalian dances, passionate in love, hecompares strikingly with the grave and knightly warriors of the Sanskritepics, which were probably receiving their final form at the time when thepoems of the Tamil anthologies were being written. A few centuries were toalter the picture somewhat, and the next stratum of Tamil literature shows amuch deeper penetration of Āryan ideals and standards, but a streak ofruthlessness and disregard for individual life is evident in the Dravidiancharacter down to the fall of Vijayanagara.Very early the Tamils took to the sea. Even in the end century B.C. theytwice invaded Ceylon, the first time soon after the death of the great kingDevanampiya Tissa, and the second a little later. The latter invasion resultedin the long occupation of the whole of the northern half of the island by theTamil king Elara, who was expelled with great difficulty by the Sinhalesenational hero, King Dutugamunu (in Pali, Dutthagamani) (161–137 B.C.).Tamils probably found their way to S.-E. Asia at about the same time, andin the 1st century A.D. were in close contact with Egypt and the RomanEmpire, through the flourishing trade with the West (p. 227ff).## THE GUPTAS AND HARSA[Page 63] We know little of events in North India after the decline of theKusanas, but it seems that by the 3rd century A.D. all India east of thePanjāb and Malwa was in the hands of small Indian kings and tribal chiefs.Some authorities have tried to depict the great Gupta emperors as liberatorsof India from the foreign yoke, but it seems that by this time the invadershad become thoroughly Indianized, and that their expulsion was the work ofthe little known predecessors of the Guptas.In A.D. 320 a new Candra Gupta,4 arose, whose successors in greatmeasure restored the splendour of the Mauryas. He owed his rise to powerlargely to his marriage with a princess Kumaradevī, of the tribe of theLicchavis, who now reappear on the scene, eight centuries after their defeatby Ajatasatru. From the prominence given to the Licchavi princess in thegenealogies of later Gupta kings, and the minting of special coins tocommemorate her marriage to Candra Gupta (fig. xxiv a, p. 381), it seemsthat the Licchavis had profited by the absence of any strong central controlto carve a new kingdom, and were very influential in Magadha at the time.Candra Gupta I possessed fairly large domains, including the regions ofMagadha and Kosala.Under his successor, Samudra Gupta (c. A.D. 335–376), Pataliputra oncemore became the centre of a great empire. Samudra’s power reached fromAssam to the borders of the Panjāb. He aimed at the establishment of aclosely knit empire of the Mauryan type, for in his great Allahabadinscription he is said to have “violently uprooted” no less than nine kings ofNorthern India, and to have annexed their kingdoms to his own. The martialtribes of Rajasthan, however, merely rendered him homage, as did severalkingdoms on his frontiers, while in the Eastern Deccan, where Samudra leda very successful expedition as far as Kāñcī (Conjeeveram), the defeatedkings were reinstated on giving homage and tribute, and probably heard nomore of their titular overlord.Samudra Gupta’s main effort was in the direction of the west, where theSakas had ruled for over 200 years and the land was enriched by thelucrative western trade. From their capital of Ujjayini (modern Ujjain) theŚakas still controlled Malwa and Kathiawar, and were a power to bereckoned with. Though Samudra’s inscription makes a vague reference tohis receiving homage from “the Saka Lords”, it is probable that he did notmeasure swords with them, or, [Page 65] if he did, was unsuccessful, for itis unlikely that he would have allowed them to remain independent if hecould have prevented it. There is indeed a story that on his death the gakasactually succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and forced a weak king,Rama Gupta, to conclude a dishonourable peace. Most authorities reject thestory, and deny the historicity of Rama Gupta, but the recent discovery ofcopper coins bearing this name tends to strengthen our belief that it has abasis of fact. 10

[Page 64]

Fig. vii. The Gupta Empire
It was Candra Gupta II (c. 376–415), the son of Samudra and younger brother of the shadowy Rama Gupta, who finally defeated the Sakas, soon after A.D. 388. Thus he became the paramount sovereign of all NorthernIndia, with the exception of the NorthWest; and he had some control overmuch of the Northern Deccan, thanks to the marriage of his daughterPrābhavatī with Rudrasena, king of the Vakatakas, who ruled a largekingdom in the modern Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad. Rudrasena diedyoung, and his widow reigned until her sons came of age. It is evident fromPrābhavatī’s charters that during her regency the Vakataka court was muchunder Gupta influence.The reign of Candra Gupta II perhaps marks the high watermark ofancient Indian culture. Later Indian legend tells of a great and good KingVikramaditya, who drove the Sakas out of Ujjayini, and ruled over all India,which in his reign was most prosperous and happy. Vikramaditya wascertainly one of the titles of Candra Gupta II, and the legend seemstherefore to refer to him. The only important discrepancy is that thetraditional Vikramaditya is said to have founded the Vikrama Era, the mostimportant of India’s many systems of dating, which is still widely current inNorth India, and which commences in 58 B.C.; thus legend places him some400 years too early. Kalidasa, the greatest of India’s poets and dramatists, istraditionally associated with Vikramaditya, and the internal evidence of hisworks points to the fact that he wrote at about this time.The prosperity and happiness of Candra Gupta’s empire is attested by another foreign traveller, unfortunately not as observant and informative asMegasthenes. This was Fa-hsien, a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelledto India in order to obtain authentic copies of the scriptures. The account ofhis travels gives much information about temples and monasteries, andrepeats many Buddhist legends, but only a few passing phrases mentionsocial conditions, and nothing at all is said about Candra Gupta himself,although Fa-hsien was in India for some six years of his reign. The pilgrimdid, however, note the peacefulness of India, the rarity of serious crime, andthe mildness of the administration. He stated that it was possible to [Page66] travel from one end of the country to the other without molestation, andwithout the need of passports. In his remarks on social custom he noted thatall respectable people were now vegetarians, meat eating being confined tolow castes and untouchables, in regard to whom he gives us the earliestclear reference to “pollution on approach”. He found Buddhism flourishingstill, but theistic Hinduism very widespread.The record of Fa-hsien shows that India had changed much since thedays of Megasthenes, some 700 years earlier. The mild ethics of Buddhismand Jainism had gradually leavened Indian society, which was now moregentle and humane than in the days of the Mauryas. tn place of the oldsacrificial Brahmanism, Hinduism had appeared, in form not very greatlydifferent from that of recent centuries. Soon harsher and.more primitiveelements were to re-emerge, but in the best days of the Gupta Empire Indianculture reached a perfection which it was never again to attain. At this timeIndia was perhaps the happiest and most civilized region of the world, forthe effete Roman Empire was nearing its destruction, and China waspassing through a time of troubles between the two great periods of theHans and the T’angs.

Candra Gupta II was succeeded by his son Kumara Gupta I (c. 415–454),who, like Samudra Gupta, performed the Vedic horsesacrifice, which, intheory at least, might only be performed by great conquerors. There is noevidence, however, that he added to his empire, although for most of hisreign he preserved it intact. But in the last years of Kumara Gupta I theempire suffered a severe blow; as with many other important events of earlyIndian history, details are annoyingly absent, but it is clear that among thechief enemies with whom the Guptas had to contend were new invaders,called in India the Hūnas. They were a Central Asian people, known toByzantine writers as Hephthalites or White Huns, and it is usuallyconsidered that they were a branch of the great group of TurkoMongolpeoples who were threatening Europe at about the same time; certainmodern scholars, however, claim that they were in no way related to theHuns of Attila, but were of Iranian stock.11 The Hūnas had occupied Bactriasome time before, and now, like the earlier Greeks, gakas and Kusanas, theycrossed the mountains and attacked the plains of India; it is probable thatkindred Central Asian tribes came in their train.Once more Western India was the prey of fierce raiders, who were withthe greatest difficulty kept at bay by the Emperor’s son, Skanda Gupta.During the war with the Hūnas Kumara Gupta died, and Skanda Gupta (c.455–467) assumed power, though not born of the [Page 67] chief queen andtherefore not the regular heir to the throne. He succeeded in re-establishingthe Gupta Empire, and by the end of 455 it was again at peace; but hereigned for little more than twelve years, and on his death the great days ofthe Guptas were over. The empire continued, but central control weakened,and local governors became feudatory kings with hereditary rights. BeyondMagadha and Bengal the Gupta emperors now exercised little more thantitular control.At the close of the 5th century fresh Hūna inroads occurred, and this timewere even more difficult to repel. The empire was disunited, and no strongman of the calibre of Skanda Gupta came forward to drive out the invader.For some thirty years, from A.D. 500 onwards, Western India was in thehands of Huna kings, two of whom, Toramana and his son Mihirakula, wereapparently mighty monarchs. The latter is remembered by the 7th centuryChinese traveller Hsiian Tsang as a fierce persecutor of Buddhism, and inKashmir, one of the centres of his power, memories of his sadistic tyrannywere still alive in the 12th century, when they were recorded by thehistorian Kalhana. Mihirakula seems to have been driven from the plain ofthe Ganges by Narasimha Gupta, who had the cognomen Baladitya, underwhich his triumph is recorded by Hsüan Tsang; about 530 Mihirakula wasalso defeated in Western India, this time by Yasodharman, an energetic kingof Mandasor, who built a large kingdom which did not survive his death.Though Mihirakula apparently retained his hold on Kashmīr and parts ofthe North-West, Hūna power never again seriously threatened India, and theHūnas soon lost their individuality.

These incursions were the death-blow of the Gupta Empire, which by A.D.550 had completely vanished. A new Gupta line, probably not related to thegreat one, ruled in Magadha until the 8th century. North of the Gangesanother kingdom, that of the Maukharis, rose to prominence, and first gaveimportance to the city of Kanyakubja, the modern Kanauj, which was tobecome the cultural centre of Northern India until the coming of theMuslims, and its largest and most prosperous city. In Gujarat a line ofGupta feudatories, the Maitrakas, became strong and independent.Evidently all semblance of political unity had again vanished. It is at thistime that we first hear of the Gurjaras, a new people who were to provideone of the strongest dynasties of the Middle Ages. The invasions of theHūnas destroyed or dispersed the older martial tribes of Rajasthan, and theirplaces were taken by newcomers, probably acclimatized invaders, fromwhom most of the Rajput clans of the Middle Ages were descended.[Page 68] The centre of interest now shifts for a time to Sthanvlsvara(modern Thanesar), in the watershed of the Satlaj and the Jamna, which isso important for India’s security, and where so many decisive battles havebeen fought. Here a local king, Prabhakaravardhana of the family ofPusyabhuiti, had grown in power as a result of successful raids on WesternIndia and against the Hūnas, who still held parts of the Panjāb. His motherwas a princess of the second Gupta line, and his daughter, Rajyasri, wasmarried to the Maukhari king, Grahavarman. Thus Prabhakaravardhanakept on good terms with his neighbours in the east, while he gatheredstrength in the west. But the Guptas and Maukharis were hereditaryenemies, and, at about the time of Prabhakaravardhana’s death, war brokeout between them. Rajyavardhana, the new king of Sthanvilvara, hurried tothe support of the Maukharis, while the Guptas had the assistance ofSasiaka, the king of Bengal. In the war both Grahavarman of Kanyakubjaand Rajyavardhana of Sthanvlsvara were killed. The former died without anheir, and the two kingdoms were combined under Harsavardhana or Harsa,the second son of Prabhakaravardhana and the brother-in-law ofGrahavarman.Harsa ascended the throne in 606 at the age of sixteen, and in the forty-one years of his reign he succeeded in partially restoring the glories of theGuptas. Some of his fame is due to the fact that, in comparison with mostother early Indian kings, his reign is remarkably well documented. The poetBāna, who was patronized by Harsa, has left a florid account of the eventsleading up to his rise to power (p. 446ff), while in the latter part of his reignIndia was visited by another Chinese pilgrim, Hsiian Tsang, who wrote avery valuable description of India, which, unlike the account ofMegasthenes, has survived intact. While his main purpose, like that of Fa-hsien, was to obtain Buddhist manuscripts and visit sacred sites, HsüanTsang was less other-worldly than the earlier pilgrim, and he was in closetouch with Harsa, whom he much admired and who gave him an honouredplace at his court. His work is therefore of much greater historical valuethan that of Fa-hsien.

Although Harsa gained control of most of Northern India, fromKāthiāwār to Bengal, his empire was feudal in structure. Outside theimmediate domains of Kānyakubjaand Sthanvisvara, many of the old kingsretained their thrones. Śaśnka, the fierce anti-Buddhist king of Bengal, whooverran Magadha at the time of Harsa’s accession, was driven back to hisown domains and his kingdom fell to Harsa, but Deva Gupta, the king whohad been chiefly responsible for the downfall of Harsa’s brother-in-lawGrahavarman Maukhari, was replacedbyarelative,Madhava Gupta, andthe Maitraka king of [Page 69] Kathiawar, after being defeated by Harsa,was allowed to retain his throne as a vassal. Harsa controlled his greatempire by ceaselessly travelling from province to province, both in his owndomains and in those of his feudatories, who seem to have spent much timein attendance on their overlord. When he died without heirs it is notsurprising that his empire fell to pieces.

Harsa seems to have been a man of great gifts and intense energy. As Candragupta by Megasthenes, he is described by Hsüan Tsang as hearingthe complaints of his humbler subjects with unwearying patience, not in hisaudience hall, but in a small travelling pavilion by the roadside. He lovedpomp, however, and in his progresses he was accompanied by a tremendoustrain of attendants, courtiers, officials, Buddhist monks, and brahmans. Hewas a loyal and warm friend, and, if we can believe the sources,fantastically generous to those whom he favoured. He loved philosophy andliterature, and in his leisure found time to write three very competentdramas (p. 441).

His empire was very extensive. Even Bhaskaravarman, the king ofremote Assam, attended his court, and if not technically feudatory to himwas much under his influence. It would seem that Bhaskaravarman assistedHarsa against Sas’ika at the beginning of his reign, and the two kings werelifelong friends. Only in the Deccan Harsa could make no progress. Here heattacked the Calukya king Pulakegin II, but was thoroughly defeated, andcould never again pass the Narmada.

Hsian Tsang shows that Buddhism was definitely declining in India at this time, although in the latter part of his reign Harsa fell increasinglyunder its influence. Now certain elements of later Hinduism, of which thereare few traces in the time of the Guptas, were strongly in evidence. Thegrowth of tantric cults (p. 337) and of such practices as sati (p. 187f) showsthat a cultural decline had already set in. Law and order were not as wellmaintained as in Gupta times, for, in contrast to Fa-hsien, who was soimpressed by the peaceable and law-abiding state of India, Hsiian Tsangwas twice robbed by bandits in Harsa’s domains, and on one occasion wasnearly sacrificed to the goddess Durga by river pirates, in the very heart ofthe empire.

## THE MIDDLE AGES IN THE NORTH
The history of the succeeding centuries is a rather drab story of endemicwarfare between rival dynasties. It can be followed in some detail, thanks tothe numerous inscriptions and copper-plate charters [Page 70] of the period,but the detail is monotonous and uninteresting to all but the specialist.On Harsa’s death there was great confusion. A usurper, Arunāśva,temporarily seized Kānyakubja, and attacked Wang Hsüan-ts’ê, who hadcome with a small detachment of troops as ambassador to Harsa from theChinese emperor, T’ai-tsung. Wang escaped with his little force andgathered reinforcements from Tibet, Nepal and Assam; with the aid of thesehe captured Arunāśva, who was taken back to China to end his days inattendance on the T’ang Emperor. After this Bhāskaravarman of Assamextended his power westwards, and occupied part of Magadha. Meanwhilethe second Gupta dynasty revived, and Adityasena Gupta was the mostimportant monarch of the latter half of the 7th century, and one of the lastgreat Indian kings to perform the Vedic horse-sacrifice. Early in the 8thcentury an upstart named Yasovarman established an empire at Kanyakubja,which for a while controlled much of the North, but which soon fell toLalitaditya, one of the few Kashmīr kings to play an important part in thepolitics of the Gangetic Plain. In the following two centuries two greatdynasties, the Palas of Bihār and Bengal, and the Gurjara-Pratiharas ofKanyakubja, divided the hegemony of Northern India between them.The Palas of Eastern India were the first to gain the ascendancy, and for awhile, in the early part of the 9th century, were the masters of Kānyakubja.The long reign of the great king Dharmapala (c. 770–810) marks the apogeeof Pala power; by the time of his death control of Kānyakubjawas lost, buthis successor, Devapala (c. 810–850), was still a very important king, whowas in diplomatic contact with the Śailendra kings of Sumītra. The Palakings are chiefly notable for their patronage of Buddhism, which, in a rathercorrupt form, flourished in their dominions during the three centuries oftheir rule. It was from the Pala empire that Buddhism was introduced intoTibet, where, combined with many native beliefs, it survives to the presentday.In the 9th and 10th centuries the Gurjara-Pratiharas, who probablyoriginated in Rajasthan, were masters of Kanyakubja, and the mostpowerful kings of Northern India. They successfully resisted the Arabs,who, in 712, had occupied Sind, and who for over a century made frequentattacks on their eastern neighbours. The two most powerful Pratihara kings,Mihira Bhoja (c. 840–885) and Mahendrapala (c. 885–910), pushed backthe Palas, and were overlords of most of Northern India as far as the bordersof Bengal. But they were weakened by the repeated invasions of theRāstrakūtas of the Deccan, who, in 916, temporarily occupied Kānyakubja.

These [Page 72] persistent raids from the south seem to have turned the attention of the Pratihara kings away from the North-West, where new forces were gathering which were ultimately to overthrow Hindu India.

Though the Pratihāras regained their capital after its occupation by the Rastrakutas, they never regained their strength, and throughout the loth century the Pratihara feudatories grew more and more powerful at the expense of their former masters.

In Afghanistan a line of Turkish chieftains had established a powerfulkingdom at Ghazni, and began to look covetously at the rich plains of India.In 986 one of their amirs, Sabuktigin, made his first raid on the mostimportant king of N.-W. India, Jayapala; in a second raid he occupiedPeshawar. In 997 he was succeeded by his son Mahmūd, who soonembarked on a deliberate policy of raiding the rich and divided kingdoms ofIndia. In 1001 he defeated and captured Jayapala, who committed suicide.Jayapala’s son, Anandapala, formed a league of Hindu princes against theinvader, but the unwieldy and disunited Indian forces, basing their strategyand tactics on ancient precepts and relying on the unpredictable morale ofthe fighting elephant, were defeated near Peshāwar by the smaller and moremobile Muslim army, and the whole of India lay open to the invader.Between 1001 and 1027 Mahmid made seventeen great raids on India. Thewhole western half of the land felt the force of the Turuskas; palaces andtemples were looted and desecrated, and enormous caravans of booty andslaves were taken back to Ghazni. The raids reached as far as the greatshrine of Somnath in Kathiawar, and the kingdom of the Candellas inBundelkhand. Among India’s great cities Kānyakubjaand Mathurā werecaptured and plundered.Mahmud did not remain in India, however, for, though Muslimchroniclers depict him as a staunch propagator of Islam, intent onconverting the infidel and bringing India under the control of the true faith,his expeditions were rather for the purpose of plunder than of conquest. Butthe N.-W. Frontier and the Panjāb were annexed to his kingdom, as were theArab kingdoms of Sind, which had long ceased to be a menace to the rest ofIndia. After the sack of Kānyakubjathe great Pratihara dynasty, which hadbeen losing power for a hundred years, soon disappeared. Its last importantking, Rajyapala, was defeated and dethroned by his neighbour Vidyadharathe Candella, whose kingdom had formerly been tributary to the Pratiharas,and who profited by their discomfiture at the hands of the Muslim to extendhis own power; but Vidyadhara himself was too weak to resist Mahmūdeffectively, and was forced to pay him tribute.For about a century and a half Northern India retained its independence.In Banāras and Kānyakubjaa new ruling family, the Gāhada [Page 73]valas, managed to build a fairly prosperous kingdom. In Rajasthan thedynasty of the Cahamanas rose in prominence and power. The influence ofthe Candellas of Bundelkhand grew with the fall of the Pratiharas. InGujarat there ruled the prosperous line of the Caulukyas or Solankīs, muchunder the influence of Jainism. In Mālwā the Paramara dynasty flourishedunder King Bhoja (1018–1055), famous in legend, who was anaccomplished scholar and a great builder of dams and artificial lakes forirrigation (p. 192f). Madhya Pradesh was in the hands of the Kalacuridynasty. In Bengal the Palas were replaced by the Senas, who were strongsupporters of orthodox Hinduism, and who inaugurated something of anantiBuddhist reaction.

As well as the main dynasties, whose names we havementioned, there were many lesser lines, theoretically tributary to thegreater, but virtually independent in their own territories and always readyto revolt against their overlords. The conservative kings of India had learntno lessons from Mahmiid’s raids. They were still incapable of serious co-operation, and their enormous armies were slow and unwieldy. At the endof the 12th century the three chief kings of Northern India-PrthvīrājaCāhamāna, Jayaccandra Gahadavala, and Paramardideva Candella5 —werein a state of tripartite war.A new Turkish ruling house supplanted the line of Mahmūd inAfghanistan. In 1173 Ghiyas-ud-din of Ghor annexed Ghazni. His youngerbrother, Shihab-ud-din, usually known as Muhammad of Ghor, proceededto conquer the Ghaznavid possessions in the Panjāb and Sind, and thenturned his attention to the Hindu states. The initiative in resistance camefrom Prthviraja, who patched up his quarrels and prepared to meet theinvader. In 1191 the Hindu army met Muhammad at Tarain, not far fromThanesar, once the capital of the great Harsa. The invaders were defeated,but in the following year they returned with a larger force. This time themounted archers of the Muslims overpowered the Hindu army andPrthviraja was defeated and killed. He is remembered to this day by theRajputs as a model of chivalry and courage, and is the hero of many folkballads.Muhammad returned home, and left the work of conquest to his generals.The chief of these, Qutb-ud-din Aibak, occupied Delhi, an important city ofthe Cahamana kingdom, and made it his headquarters. Another general,Muhammad ibn Bakhtiyar, pressed on down [Page 74] the Ganges andoverran Bihār, where he put many Buddhist monks to the sword. He thenoccupied Bengal with little difficulty. The Candella kingdom ofBundelkhand fell in 1203. In 1206 Muhammad, who had succeeded hisbrother as sultan of Ghor, was assassinated, and his general Qutb-ud-din, amanumitted slave, became the first sultan of Delhī.In Rajasthan and other outlying districts Hindu kingdoms continued,sometimes paying tribute to the more energetic sultans, but often virtuallyfree, while regions with sharply defined natural boundaries, such asKashmir, Nepal, Assam and Orissā, retained their autonomy. Thesekingdoms had always been in effect independent, only occasionallyrendering tribute and homage to the greater kings of the Plains, and ingeneral they had little political effect on India as a whole, and were littleaffected by it politically. From now on, until the 18th century, Muslimrulers dominated Northern India, and the great days of Hindu civilizationwere at an end.


## THE MIDDLE AGES IN THE PENINSULA
While in Northern India the standards of Hindu culture declined somewhat after the Gupta age, in the Deccan they flourished and advanced.  By this time Āryan influence had penetrated the whole of the Peninsula, and the contact of Āryan and Dravidian produced a vigorous cultural synthesis, which in turn had an immense influence on Indian civilization as a whole.

Power was generally centred on two foci, one in the Western Deccan and the other in the Cōla country, the Coromandel coast. The political history ofthe medieval Deccan is largely concerned with the struggles between thedynasties controlling these two centres. Many lsser kingdoms also existed,however, often tributary to the larger ones, but sometimes rising toconsiderable power.In the Northern Deccan the Vakatakas vanished at about the same time asthe Guptas, and in the middle of the 6th century the west and centre of thePeninsula came under the control of the Calukya Dynasty, ruling fromVātāpi (now called Badami) in Hyderabad. Its greatest king, Pulakegin II(c. 609–642), was the approximate contemporary of Harsa, whom hesuccessfully resisted, only to be defeated at the end of his reign byNarasimhavarman, the Pallava king of Kāñcī (Conjeeveram). The Pallavas,who had been ruling since the 4th century, were great temple builders (p.355), and seem to have much encouraged the growth of Āryan institutionsin the South.In the 7th century the Calukyas divided into eastern and western [Page75] branches, and in the following century the western branch was replacedby the Rastrakutas of Manyakheta (modern Malkhed, in Hyderabad), whosemartial efforts were largely directed against the North, and who made manyraids beyond the Narmada. A revived Calukya line, ruling from Kalyani,replaced the Rastrakutas in 973, and controlled the Deccan until the end ofthe 12th century, when their empire was divided between the Yadavas ofDevagiri in the Northern Deccan, the Kākatīyas of Warangal in the Telugu-speaking areas of the east, and the Hoysalas of Dōrasamudra in Mysore.The Pallavas of Kanci persisted with declining fortunes until the end ofthe 9th century, when their territories were annexed by the Cola kings ofTanjore, Aditya I (c. 870–906), and Parāntaka. I (c. 906–953). The Cōlakingdom, one of the three great kingdoms of Tamil tradition, had beenvirtually submerged by the Pallavas for centuries. Now it rose again, and forsome 300 years ruled the Coromandel Coast and much of the EasternDeccan, giving a large measure of security to its people and supporting aflourishing social and cultural life. The most notable of the Cōla kings wereRajaraja I (985–1014) and Rajendra I (1014–1042), in whose reigns thepower of the dynasty reached its zenith. The former conquered Ceylon, andthe latter carried his power by land to the mouth of the Ganges, and sent outa great naval expedition, which occupied parts of Burma, Malaya andSumatra. This was perhaps despatched with the intention of suppressing thepiratical activities of the Indonesian kings, who interfered with theflourishing trade between South India and China. The Cōla hold on S.-E.Asia does not appear to have lasted long, however, and Rajendra’s navalexpedition is unique in the annals of India.The Cōlas held Northern Ceylon until soon after 1070, when they wereexpelled by the Sinhalese king Vijayabahu I (1070–1114). From now on theCōla power declined, and the Pāndya kings of Madurai were continuallyattempting to regain their independence, while pressure from the Calukyasincreased. Vijayabahu of Ceylon inaugurated a period of success andprosperity for the island, which culminated in the reign of Parakramabahu I(1153–1186), the greatest of Sinhalese kings (pl. LX a), whose splendourcan be seen in the remains of his capital, Polonnaruva, whither the seat ofgovernment had been transferred from the earlier capital of Anuradhapuraat the time of the Tamil invasions. Parakramabahu for a while turned thetables on the Tamils, and Sinhalese troops, profiting by the Pandyanrebellions against the Cōlas, attacked the Indian coast, and even temporarilyoccupied Madurai.

Though their power declined, the Cōlas long maintained the central [Page76] part of their empire, the region around Kāñcī and Tanjore. The politicalstability and freedom from attack afforded by their efficient governmentgreatly encouraged Tamil culture, and the large number of donativeinscriptions of this period testifies to a flourishing economy.Administratively the Cōla Empire is remarkable for the influence exertedby local autonomous bodies; village and district councils, under thesupervision of the central government, introduced an element into thestructure of the state which, if not democratic, was at least popular (p. 106).The Cōlas fell in the 13th century when their territory was shared by theHoysalas of Mysore and the revived Pandya dynasty of Madurai. Now theDeccan was soon to feel the force of Islam, which was already the master ofNorthern India. In the reign of theablesultanofDelhi,Ala’-ud-din Khalji(1296–1315), a series of brilliant raids, led by the eunuch general MalikKafur, a converted Hindu, crushed the Deccan kingdoms, and for a time aMuslim sultanatewasset up even in Madurai, in the extreme south.The Dravidians were not finally subjugated, however. Within a few yearsof Malik Kafur’s raids, in 1336, an independent Hindu kingdom wasfounded at Vijayanagara, on the Tufigabhadra River. This kingdom, afterdesperately resisting the Bahmani sultans of the Northern Deccan,established its hegemony over the whole Peninsula from the Krsna Riversouthwards. Learning something of military strategy from their Muslimenemies, the kings of Vijayanagara maintained their independence until themiddle of the 16th century, and, in a reduced form, even later. Of thesplendour and affluence of their capital we have European accounts, fromthe Italian Nicolo dei Conti, who visited India in the early 15th century andfrom the Portuguese travellers Paes and Nuniz, who made contact with thekingdom of Vijayanagara about a hundred years later from the recentlyestablished Portuguese settlement of Goa. All were impressed by thesplendour of the capital and the wealth of the court. The great king KrsnaDeva Raya (1509–1529) (pl. LXXI), had he lived longer, might have driventhe Muslims from the Deccan altogether. Of him Paes wrote in terms rarelyused by a European traveller of an oriental monarch:“He is the most feared and perfect king that could possibly be, cheerfulof disposition and very merry; he is one that seeks to honour foreigners, …asking about all their affairs whatever their condition may be. He is a greatruler and a man of much justice, but subject to sudden fits of rage.… He isby rank a greater lord than any, by reason of what he possesses in armiesand territories, but … he has nothing compared to what a man like himought to have, so gallant and perfect is he in all things.” 12[Page 77] Paes, in the reign of Krsna Deva Raya, remarked on theprosperity of the people and the cheapness of provisions; but Nuniz, thesecond Portuguese traveller, who visited Vijayanagara in the reign ofKrsna’s successor Acyuta (1529–42), was less impressed, and stated thatthe underlings of the king were overbearing and the common people muchoppressed. It is evident that the beneficient regime of Krsna Deva Raya wasnot continued after his death. His successors were weaker men than he, andembroiled themselves unnecessarily in the intrigues of the Muslimsultanates of the Northern Deccan, relying on the prestige gained for themby their more powerful predecessor. In 1565, at Talikota, the de facto rulerof Vijayanagara, Rama Raja, was utterly defeated by a coalition of Deccansultans, the great city was mercilessly sacked, and the greatness of theempire was at an end.This was the last important Hindu kingdom of the older type. That of theMarathas, which arose in the Western Deccan in the late 17th century andwas the most forceful element in Indian politics in the 18th, lies beyond ourprovince.

The ultimate importance of this period in the history of the Peninsula was
cultural and religious. Jainism was once very strong in Mysore and other
parts of the South, and often, under royal patronage, it became virtually the
state religion. But in the Tamil country at this period a new ecstatically
devotional theism arose, looking for inspiration rather to hymns in the
vernacular than to the Vedas or earlier sacred texts in Sanskrit. This was
subsequently to set the standard for the popular religion of the whole of
India, through the work of missionary theologians who travelled all over the
sub-continent in the later middle ages. The work and influence of the great
medieval Dravidian saints and philosophers will be discussed in another
chapter.

This brief outline of the political history of Hindu India shows that sheproduced many bold adventurers and imperious conquerors. As ourfollowing chapter tells, they were ruthless in gaining and retaining power,and looked on war as a normal political expedient. Except during theMauryan period political unity was unknown, and the highly organized andtightly controlled administration of the ancient Indian state had nocounterpart in inter-state relations, where endemic anarchy was onlymitigated by a tradition of fair play in warfare, which was by no meansalways followed. Here, and in the conservatism of the medieval period, laythe great weakness of Hindu India, which made her a prey to successiveinvaders. Of these the wild tribes of Central Asia were rapidly assimilated,but the Muslims with their rigidly codified religion, were too much for eventhe omnivorous Hindu culture to digest. Interaction between the two [Page78] religions and ways of life indeed took place, and once at least a modusvivendi was almost reached (p. 480). It is not wholly surprising, however,that, when India began to reassert herself, two nations should have replacedthe single British Raj; but all impartial students must regret that the unity ofthe Indian sub-continent has been once more lost, and trust that the twogreat nations of India and Pakistan may soon forget the bitterness born ofcenturies of strife, in cooperation for the common welfare of their peoples.

1 This is the name as given by classical sources. It probably represents
the Sanskrit Jmbhi.

2 Probably the Sanskrit Paurava, which would connect Porus with the old
Kuru tribe, of whose ruling family this was a cognomen.

3 In this context this word is an anachronism, as it is Persian, and was
introduced by the Muslims, but it is better known and less ambiguous than
the equivalent Sanskrit word, sabhd.

4 We divide the name into its two component parts to distinguish this
king and Candra Gupta II from Candragupta Maurya. In Sanskrit the names
are identical.

5 These names are often met in their Hindi forms: Prithvirāj or Pithorā
Chāuhān, Jaichand Gaharwār, and Parmdl Candel.



IV.

THE STATE: POLITICAL LIFE AND
THOUGHT


SOURCES
[Page 79]
FROM the days of Plato and Aristotle European thought has turned its attention to such questions as the origin of the state, the ideal form ofgovernment, and the basis of law, and politics has long been looked on as abranch of philosophy. India also thought on such questions, but she had noschools of political philosophy in the Western sense. The problems whichform the stock-in-trade of the European political philosopher are answeredin Indian texts, but in a take-it-or-leave-it manner, with little discussion;often indeed the only argument in favour of a proposition is the citation ofan old legend, used much as Plato’s adaptations of older myths to reinforcehis theories.

Though India had no formal political philosophy, the science of statecraft was much cultivated, and a number of important textbooks on this topic have survived. Dandanīti, the administration of force, or rājanīti, the conduct of kings, was a severely practical science, and the texts cursorilydismiss the more philosophical aspect of politics, but give comparativelydetailed advice on the organization of the state and the conduct ofgovernmental affairs. The later Vedic literature tells us something,incidentally, about political life and thought in the pre-Buddhist period, andwe can gather much from the Pāli scriptures of Buddhism; but the earliestand most important textbook specifically devoted to statecraft is theKautilīya Arthaśāstra, which is attributed to Kautilya, the famous ministerof Candragupta Maurya (p. 50). Some authorities still maintain the fullauthenticity of the work, but there are grave objections to this view. Thetext refers to people and places (notably China) which do not seem to havebeen known to the Indians in the 4th century B.C. It does not use much ofthe official terminology employed in the Aśokan inscriptions or in the Pāliscriptures, but it contains many governmental terms which apparently didnot become popular until post-Mauryan times. Yet it is certainly pre-Guptan, and is, we believe, the elaboration of a Mauryan original whichwas perhaps the work of Kautilya himself. Whatever its age, the Arthaśāstragives very detailed instructions on the control of the state, the organizationof the national economy, and the conduct [Page 80] of war, and it is a mostprecious source-book for many aspects of ancient Indian life.

The next important source, in chronological order, is the great epic, the Mahābhārata, of which the twelfth book, known as the Santi Parvan, is acollection of many disparate passages on statecraft and human conduct,inserted into the body of the epic in the early centuries of the Christian era.Other passages on statecraft are found elsewhere in the Mahābhārata, and inthe second of the great epics, the Rāmāyna. The great body of literaturegenerally called Smrti, giving instruction in the Sacred Law, is veryimportant in this connexion, and will be discussed later (p. 128f); especiallysignificant is the seventh section of the lawbook ascribed to the primevalsage Manu, probably composed early in the Christian era.

From the Gupta period and the Middle Ages a number of political texts survive, the most important of which are the Nītisāra (“Essence of Politics”) of Kāmandaka, perhaps written during the Gupta period, the Nītivākyāmrta(“Nectar of Aphorisms on Politics”) of Somadeva Sūri, a Jaina writer of the10th century, and the Nītiśātra (“Treatise on Politics”) attributed to theancient sage Śukra, but evidently of late medieval origin. These repeatmuch that has been said before, but here and there contain original ideas.Besides sources specifically dealing with political life and thought, ancientIndian literature as a whole, from the Rg Veda onwards, yields muchinformation, and inscriptions of one kind and another are extremelyvaluable in this connexion.

The texts do not discuss wholly impossible utopias; their advice is often pedantic, but usually more or less feasible. However, it is not likely that anyking conducted his affairs wholly on textbook lines, and there is ampleevidence that the recommendations of the experts were not always put intoeffect. The reader must always bear in mind that in the texts on statecraftand Sacred Law the authors describe things not as they were in fact, but asthey believed they ought to be. Probably in no kingdom of ancient India,not even in that of the Mauryas, was the influence of the state quite so all-pervading as in the system envisaged by the Arthaśāstra, though its authorevidently based his precept upon current practice. Similarly the viciouspunishments laid down by Manu for religious crimes (for example a śūdrawho “arrogantly teaches brāhmans their duty” shall have boiling oil pouredin his mouth and ears1) are the suggestions of a fanatic and were rarely ifever put into practice. Moreover the texts are permeated with pedantry, andshow the passion for sterile classification to which the Indian pandit hasoften been prone. It is unlikely that the more energetic and self-reliant rulersworried [Page 81] overmuch about the Arthaśātra’s discussion of differentschools of thought on such questions as whether it is better to acquire a wildand rebellious but prosperous country, or a pacific but poor one. Manyerrors have been made by historians through their uncritical acceptance ofthese political texts as giving an exact picture of things as they were.

## KINGSHIP
The earliest legend on the origin of kingship occurs in the Aitareya Brāhmana, 2 one of the later Vedic texts, perhaps of the 8th or 7th century B.C. This tells how the gods and demons were at war, and the gods were suffering badly at the hands of their enemies. So they met together and decided that they needed a rājā to lead them in battle. They appointed Indra as their king, and the tide soon turned in their favour. This legend suggests that in the earliest times kingship in India was thought to be based uponhuman need and military necessity, and that the king’s first duty was to leadhis subjects in war. A little later the Taittirīya Upanisad3 repeats the story,but in a significantly altered form; the discomfited gods did not elect Indra,but sacrificed to the high god Prajāpati, who sent his son Indra to becometheir king. At this stage the king was still thought of as primarily a leader inwar-“they who have no king cannot fight” says the text-but kingship wasalready given divine sanction and the king of the immortals, who was theprototype of all earthly kings, held his office by the appointment of theMost High.

Even at this time, before the days of the Buddha, the king was exalted far above ordinary mortals, through the magical power of the great royal sacrifices. The Royal Consecration (rājasūya), which in its full form comprised a series of sacrifices lasting for over a year, imbued the king with divine power. In the course of the ceremonies he was identified with Indra “because he is a ksatriya and because he is a sacrificer”, 4 and even with the high god Prajāpati himself.5 He took three steps on a tiger’s skin, and was thus magically identified with the god Visnu, whose three paces covered earth and heaven. The chief priest addressed the gods with the words: “Of mighty power is he who has been consecrated; now he has become one of yours; you must protect him.”6 The king was evidently the fellow of the gods, if not a god himself.

The magical power which pervaded the king at his consecration wasrestored and strengthened in the course of his reign by further rites, such asthe ceremonial rejuvenation of the vājapeya and the horse-sacrifice( aśvamedha, p. 42), which not only ministered to his [Page 82] ambitionand arrogance, but also ensured the prosperity and fertility of the kingdom.Implicit in the whole brāhmanic ritual was the idea of the king’s divineappointment, and though the rājasūfya was replaced in later times by asimplified abhiseka, or baptism, the ceremony still had this magical flavour.

But the centre of brāhmanic culture was the Ganges-Jamnā Doāb. Ifamong the Kurus and Pañcālas, who were the chief tribes of this region, theking was hedged about with divine mystery, elsewhere his status may havebeen less exalted, for the Buddhists had their own legend of the origin ofkingship, which involved no heavenly prototype, but looked back to aprimitive social contract.7 The story is put into the mouth of the Buddhahimself, and, whether or not it is really his, it certainly represents thethought on the subject in the eastern part of India in the centuries followingthe Buddha’s death, for the Jainas, who rose at about the same time and inthe same region, had a very similar legend.8In the early days of the cosmic cycle mankind lived on an immaterialplane, dancing on air in a sort of fairyland, where there was no need of foodor clothing, and no private property, family, government or laws. Thengradually the process of cosmic decay began its work, and mankind becameearthbound, and felt the need of food and shelter. As men lost their primevalglory distinctions of class ( varna) arose, and they entered into agreementsone with another, accepting the institutions of private property and thefamily. With this theft, murder, adultery, and other crime began, and so thepeople met together and decided to appoint one man among them tomaintain order in return for a share of the produce of their fields and herds.

He was called “the Great Chosen One” ( Mahāsammata), and he received the title of rājā because he pleased the people. The etymology of the word rājā from the verb rañayati (“he pleases”) is certainly a false one, but it was widely maintained and is found even in non-Buddhist sources. The story of the Mahāsammata gives, in the form of a myth worthy ofPlato, one of the world’s earliest versions of the widespread contractualtheory of the state, which in Europe is specially connected with the namesof Locke and Rousseau. It implies that the main purpose of government isto establish order, and that the king, as head of the government, is the firstsocial servant, and ultimately dependent on the suffrage of his subjects.Thus in ancient Indian thought on the question of the origin of monarchytwo strands are evident, the mystical and the contractual, often ratherincongruously combined.

In thought, if not in practice, it was the mystical theory of kingship [Page83] which carried most weight with succeeding generations. The author ofthe Arthaśāstra had no illusions about the king’s human nature, and seemsto have had little time for mysticism, but he recognized that legends aboutthe origin of kingship had propaganda value. In one place he advises thatthe king’s agents should spread the story that, when anarchy prevailed at thedawn of the aeon, men elected the mythical first king Manu Vaivasvata tokingship. 9 He thus encourages a contractual theory. In the same passage,however, he states that the people should be told that, as the king fulfils thefunctions of the gods Indra (the king of the gods) and Yama (the god ofdeath) upon earth, all who slight him will be punished not only by thesecular arm, but also by heaven. When the king harangues his troops beforebattle he is advised to tell them that he is a paid servant just as they are; 10but at the same time he is told to go to the length of having his secret agentsdisguised as gods, and allowing himself to be seen in their company, inorder that his simpler subjects may believe that he mixes with the gods onequal terms.11 Aśoka and other Mauryan kings took the title “Beloved ofthe Gods” ( Devānampiya), and, though they seem not to have claimedwholly divine status, they were no doubt looked on as superior semi-divinebeings.

In the period of the later Vedas, though there is no evidence that a reallylarge Indian kingdom had existed since the days of the then forgottenHarappā Culture, the possibility of a realm reaching to the sea wasrecognized, perhaps as a result of what Indians had heard of Babylonia orPersia. With the Mauryas the possibility was realized, and though they toowere soon largely forgotten, they left behind them the tradition of theUniversal Emperor ( cakravartin), which was incorporated into Buddhisttradition, and, blended with later Vedic imperialist ideas, was taken over byorthodox Hinduism. Just as Buddhas appear from time to time in the cosmiccycle, heralded by auspicious omens and endowed with favourable signs, tolead all living beings along the road to enlightenment, so do UniversalEmperors appear, to conquer all Jambūdvīpa and rule prosperously andrighteously. The concept of the Universal Emperor was also known to theJainas, and in the Epics numerous kings of legend, such as Yudhisthira andRāma, are said to have been digvijayins, conquerors of all the four quarters.

The Universal Emperor was a divinely ordained figure with a special place in the cosmic scheme, and as such was exalted to semi-divine status. The tradition was an inspiration to ambitious monarchs, and in the Middle Ages some even claimed to be Universal Emperors themselves. The invasions of the Greeks, Śakas and Kusānas brought new influencesfrom West and East. Their kings, following the practice [Page 84] of theorientalized Seleucids and other rulers of the Middle East, took the semi-divine title trātāra, equivalent to the Greek(saviour); they were notsatisfied with the simple title of rājā, which had served Aśoka, but were“great kings” ( mahārāja) and “kings of kings” ( rājaāirāja) on the Persianmodel. The Kusānas, perhaps from the influence of China, where theemperor was the Son of Heaven, took the further title “Son of the Gods”( devaputra). Later, from Gupta times onwards, every important king wouldtake some such title as “Great King of Kings, Supreme Lord”( mahārājādhirāja-paramabhaāraka), while even the title mahārāja wasused only for small vassal kings.

prince. At his feet the imperial elephant and horse.

With these influences at work the doctrine of royal divinity was explicitly
proclaimed. It appears first in the Epics and the Lawbook of Manu. The
latter declares in dignified language:
“When the world was without a king and dispersed in fear in all
directions, the Lord created a king for the protection of all. [Page 85]
“He made him of eternal particles Of Indra and the Wind, Yama, the
Sun and Fire, Varuna, the Moon, and the Lord of Wealth.

“And, because he has been formed of fragments of all those gods,
the king surpasses all other beings in splendour.

“Even an infant king must not be despised, as though a mere mortal,
for he is a great god in human form.” 12
To the ideal of the Universal Emperor was added the inspiration of the
revival of such brāhmanic ceremonies as the horse-sacrifice, which
apparently fell into desuetude under the Mauryas, but was revived by the
Śungas, and was performed by many later kings both in north and south.

Even comparatively feeble and petty monarchs managed to perform horse-sacrifices of some sort, and claimed the exalted status of the emperors oflegend. After the time of the Guptas these sacrifices became rare, however-the last we have been able to trace took place in the Cōa Empire in the 11thcentury13—but the tradition of royal divinity continued. Kings referred totheir divine status in their titles and panegyrics, and they were regularlyaddressed by their courtiers as deva, or god. The Cōla kings and someothers were even worshipped as gods in the temples.

In the period between the Mauryas and Guptas anarchy frequentlyprevailed. Mass lawlessness, riot, pillage and rape, were widespread.Raiding bands of invaders from the North-West penetrated far into the heartof India, and some brāhmans even believed that the end of the aeon wasdrawing near and that the world would soon be destroyed. It was then thatan almost pathological dread of anarchy ( mātsyanyāya, literally “the way ofthe fishes”, of whom the stronger eat the weaker) grew in the minds ofIndian thinkers. In the words of the Rāmāyana:“Where the land is kingless the cloud, lightning-wreathed and loud-voiced, gives no rain to the earth.

“Where the land is kingless the son does not honour his father, nor the wife her husband.

“Where the land is kingless men do not meet in assemblies, nor make lovely gardens and temples.

[Page 86] “Where the land is kingless the rich are unprotected, and shepherds and peasants sleep with bolted doors.

“A river without water, a forest without grass, a herd of cattle without a herdsman, is the land without a king.” 14
Passages such as this, which may be paralleled in many sources, further
assisted in strengthening the royal prestige, and it is in their light that we
must read later legends on the origin of kingship.

There is a very ancient story of a first man, Manu, who combined thecharacteristics of Adam and Noah in Hebrew tradition (p. 302). This storyappears in many forms and versions, one of which, found in theMahābhārata, 15 tells that at the beginning of this period of cosmic time,when greed and wrath had disturbed human relations, men inflicted untoldmisery upon one another. As in the Buddhist legend, they agreed to respecteach other’s life and property, but they had no confidence in their contracts,and so they approached the high god, Brahmā, to help them; he nominatedManu, here thought of not as a man, but a god, to be their first king. Somesuch legend as this was in the mind of the author of the Laws of Manu,when he composed the passage we have quoted. Variants of this story occurin other parts of the Mahābhārata and elsewhere, some making the firstking Virajas, the son of the god Visnu. 16 All adapt the earlier legends tostress the divine status of the king, and his divine appointment to the kinglyoffice. With the exception of a few Rājput families who claimed descentfrom the fire-god Agni, nearly all medieval Indian kings traced theirgenealogies back to Manu, either through his son Iksvāku or his daughterIlā; descendants of Iksvaku are referred to as of the solar, and those of Ila asof the lunar line.

Despite the growth of royal pretensions through the centuries the claims
of the king did not go unchallenged, and in practice his divinity often made
little difference to the body politic. Divinity was cheap in ancient India.

Every brāhman was in a sense a god, as were ascetics with a reputation for sanctity. Householders sponsoring and financing sacrifices were in theory raised to divinity, at least for the duration of the ceremony, while even sticks and stones might be alive with inherent godhead. Moreover the gods were fallible and capable of sin. If the king was a god on earth he was onlyone god among many, and so his divinity might not always weigh heavilyupon his subjects. The Buddhists and Jainas explicitly denied the king’sgodhead, and one court poet at least, Bāsa, who was patronized by the greatHarsa, had the temerity to reject the whole rigmarole of royal divinity as thework of sycophants who befuddled the minds [Page 87] of weak and stupidmonarchs, but did not fool the strong and the wise. 17 The king was usuallyheld in great awe and respect, but it is doubtful if he was ever treated withquite the same abject servility as were, for instance, the more psychopathicRoman or Chinese emperors.

Though the king was an autocrat, not limited by constitutional controls, there were many practical checks on his sovereignty. The Arthaśāstra, totalitarian and secular in tendency, maintains that royal ordinance can rightly override all other sources of law, but most theorists would have disagreed with this statement. The king’s function was not conceived interms of legislation, but of protection, and this involved the protection notonly of his subjects from invasion, but also of the order of society, the rightway of life for all classes and ages ( varnāśrama-dharma, p. 137), as laiddown in the sacred texts. If he infringed sacred custom too blatantly heincurred the hostility of the brāhmans, and often of the lower orders also. Insuch a case his fate was pointed out to him in many a cautionary tale, themost common of which was that of the legendary Vena. This kingapparently took his divinity too seriously, for he forbade all sacrificesexcept to himself, and confused society by enforcing interclass marriages.

The divine sages (rsis) remonstrated with him, but Vena continued in his evil courses. At last the exasperated sages beset him in a body and slew him with blades of sacred grass ( kuśa), which miraculously turned to spears in their hands. This story, repeated in numerous sources, must have been a continual warning to the secularly-minded king tempted to flout the SacredLaw. No doubt many headstrong kings succeeded in breaking it withimpunity, but the recognition of the moral justification of revolt against animpious king must always have acted as some check on his autocracy. Morethan one great dynasty, such as the Nandas, Mauryas and Śungas, fell as aresult of brāhmanic intrigue. The Mahābhārata explicitly sanctions revoltagainst a king who is oppressive or fails in his function of protection,saying that such a ruler is no king at all, and should be killed like a maddog. 18The brāhmans and the Sacred Law were not the only checks on the king.

All textbooks on statecraft recommend the king to listen to the counsel of his ministers, who are advised to be fearless in debate, and more than one king was overthrown through the intrigues of his councillors. Another and very important check was public opinion. The Vedic rājā was limited by popular or semi-popular assemblies, and though these disappeared in later times kings were invariably advised to keep a finger on the pulse of public feeling, and never to offend it too blatantly. The Buddhist Jātaka stories [Page 88] (p. 267), which are certainly not historical, but reflect conditions in Northern India well before the beginning of the Christian Era, give more than one instance of kings deposed by mass revolt. In the legend of Rāma(p. 412f), who was held up as an ideal king to later Hindu rulers, the heroexiles his beloved wife Sītā, though he is himself convinced of herinnocence, on hearing the news that his subjects suspect her chastity, andfear that her presence in the palace will bring misfortune on the nation. Atthe very end of our period the great king of Vijayanagara, Krsna Deva Rāya(p. 76) remitted a marriage tax because it was not popular. 19 The Indiantown mob was dangerously inflammable, and the king who seriouslyoutraged popular opinion did so at his own peril. Most textbooks insist thathe must at all costs keep the masses contented.

Nevertheless ancient India had her supporters of passive obedience. TheMahābhārata, which, as we have seen, in places expressly allows revoltagainst a wicked king, elsewhere states that any king is better than none.The dread of anarchy was a potent factor in preserving even a weak andoppressive king on his throne.“A man should first choose his king, then his wife, and only thenamass wealth; for without a king in the world where would wife andproperty be?” 20


## THE ROYAL FUNCTION THE ROYAL FUNCTION
The idea of a body politic, of the state as an organism transcending its component parts, though it appears in a rather vague form, does not seem tohave taken any great hold on ancient Indian thought. A classificationpopular with the theorists enumerates seven elements of sovereignty, which are occasionally compared to the limbs and parts of the human body-the king to the head, the ministers to the eyes, the ally to the ear, thetreasury to the mouth, the army to the mind, the fortifications to the arms,and the land and people to the legs. Such weak analogies carried littleweight, however. Society, the age-old divinely ordained way of Indian life,transcended the state and was independent of it. The king’s function was theprotection of society, and the state was merely an extension of the king forthe furtherance of that end.The king’s function involved the protection not only of his kingdomagainst external aggression, but also of life, property and traditional customagainst internal foes. He protected the purity of class and caste by ensuringthat those who broke caste custom were excommunicated; he protected thefamily system by punishing adultery, and ensuring the fair inheritance offamily property; he protected widows and orphans by making them hiswards; he protected the rich against the poor by suppressing robbery; and heprotected the poor against the rich by punishing extortion and oppression.Religion was protected by liberal grants to learned brāhmans and temples,and frequently to heterodox sects also. The duty of protection was oftenlittle more than the preservation of the status quo, but it was neverthelessonerous, and involved positive duties, such as developing irrigation,relieving famine, and generally supervising the economic life of the realm.

PLATE XX
The ideal set before the king was one of energetic beneficence. Aśokawas not the only king of India to proclaim that all men were his children, orto take pride in his ceaseless activity. The Arthaśāstra, despite its advocacyof every dishonest expedient for the acquisition and maintenance of power,puts the kingly duty in simple and forceful language, setting an ideal suchas few ancient civilizations can boast of. Comparing the king and theascetic it says:“The king’s pious vow is readiness in action, his sacrifice, thedischarge of his duty.

“In the happiness of his subjects lies the king’s happiness, in the
welfare of his subjects, his welfare. The king’s good is not that which
pleases him, but that which pleases his subjects.

“Therefore the king should be ever active, and should strive for
prosperity, for prosperity depends on effort, and failure on the
reverse.”21

Elsewhere the Arthaśāstra suggests a time-table for the king’s day, which allows him only four and a half hours’ sleep and three hours for eating and recreation, the rest of the day being spent in state affairs of one kind or another. No doubt such a programme was rarely kept in practice, but it at least shows the ideal at which the king was expected to aim. Candragupta Maurya is said by Megasthenes to have listened to the petitions of hissubjects even while in the hands of his masseurs, while his grandson Aśokaordered that important business was to be set before him at all times, evenwhen he was in his harem. In all sources the king is told that he must beprompt in the administration of justice and always accessible to his [Page90] people. The swarms of guards, ushers, and other officials whosurrounded the king’s person must often have demanded bribes, andotherwise have obstructed the access of the subject to his sovereign, but thebest of Indian kings at all times have made the public audience, or darbār,an important instrument of government.

Nearly all the foreign travellers who visited India during our period were much impressed by the pomp and luxury of the Indian king, and their impressions are confirmed by native sources. The king’s splendid palace was controlled by a chamberlain, who had a large staff of palace servants of both sexes; the spiritual life of the palace was cared for by the courtchaplain, or purohita, and many lesser brāhmans; while numerousastrologers, physicians, poets, painters, musicians and learned men dwelt inthe purlieus of the palace and enjoyed royal patronage. An important figurein early days, though he is not referred to in the inscriptions of later times,was the sūta, who combined the functions of royal charioteer, herald andbard, and was often the friend and confidant of the king. Another memberof the royal entourage was the vidūsaka, known to us chiefly fromtheSanskritplays,whocorresponded approximately to the court jester ofmedieval Europe.Many kings were almost constantly on the move, touring their kingdomswith enormous trains of troops, courtiers, wives, concubines and servants.On such tours business was combined with pleasure-hunts were arrangedand famous shrines visited, but also recalcitrant vassals were chastised andlocal grievances investigated. Many inscriptions on stone and copper, fromthe days of Aśoka onwards, record the munificence of pious kings toreligious foundations and brāhmans while on such tours.Kings were expected to patronize art, letters and learning. Like most menof the upper classes they were literate, and often devoted much of theirleisure to hearing the recitations of their court poets. Some were themselvescompetent writers, and numerous works ascribed to royal authors havesurvived. Samudra Gupta was a famous musician, and is depicted on someof his coins playing the harp (fig. xxivb, p. 381).Despite the injunctions of the Arthaśāstra the king often found time forother, less intellectual, pursuits. Hunting was usually among the chief of hispleasures, and though the doctrine of non-injury discouraged it, a tacitexception was made in the case of kings and nobles. Kings are oftenreferred to as gambling with their courtiers, and sometimes as indulging indrinking bouts, not only with the court, but in the privacy of the harem withthe queens and concubines. The textbooks reprobate all these amusements,which are reviewed [Page 91] in the Arthaśāstra, whose author quaintlyquotes the opinions of various earlier authorities on their comparativeperniciousness.The harem ( antahpura) was in charge of an official ( kañcukin), usuallynot a eunuch, as in many other ancient civilizations, but an elderlyman,whoisgenerally depicted in literature as a benevolent and fatherly friendboth of the king and his ladies. The ladies of theharem,whetherqueensorconcubines,seem,fromseveralplaysandstories dealing with this aspect ofpalace life, to have been fairly well treated; though kPoth they and the kingoften went in some fear of the chief queen ( mahisī),whosepowerintheharem was very great and was often wielded rather harshly over the lesserqueens and concubines.Ideally a royal family was of the ksatriya or warrior class, but in practicethiswasoften not the case. The Śusgas and Kāsvas were brahmans, as wereseveral other Indian dynasties; the family of Harsa is said by Hstian Tsangto have been of the vaiśya,ormercantileclass; while the Nandas, andperhaps even the Mauryas, sprang from the despised śūidras. In practice theaphorism “whoever bears rule is aksatriya”wasapplied,andafterafewgenerations kingly families from the lower orders were quietly assimilatedin the martial class.Kingship was normally reserved for the male, though a few small Orissanruling families in the Middle Ages seem regularly to have permitted adaughter to inherit the throne. Diddā, the wicked 10thcentury queen ofKashmīr, managed to retain control of the state by acting as regent for hersons, and putting them to death one after the other before they reached theirmajorities. The benevolent queen of the Kākatīyas of Warangal, Rudrammā(c. 1259–1288), governed by a legal fiction, drafting her state documents inthe masculine gender. Queens did, however, act as regents during theirsons’ minorities, as in the case of Diddā and Prabhāvatī Guptā (p. 65), androyal ladies sometimes wielded much power in the state. Thus Rājyaśri,widow of Grahavarman, the last Maukhari king of Kānyakubja, regularlytook a seat of honour beside her brother Harsa, and shared in statedeliberations. Women in politics were often to be found in the medievalkingdoms of the Peninsula; for instance Akkādevī, sister of the Cślukyaking Jayasimha II (1015–1042), was a provincial governor, and Kundavai,the elder sister of the great Cōla Rājarāja I, seems to have played a rolesimilar to that of Rājyaśrī. Women even sometimes took part in war-Akkādevī fought battles and superintended sieges, while Umādevī, queen ofthe Hoysala king Vīraballāla II (1173–1220), led two campaigns againstrecalcitrant vassals.[Page 92] Succession was normally by primogeniture, but exceptions mightoften occur for the Sacred Law did not allow a diseased, maimed orseriously infirm prince to ascend the throne, and the line could not passthrough such a prince. Thus in the Mahābhārata legend (p. 408) thePāndava princes were quite within their rights in claiming the throne fromthe blind Dhrtarāstra. Moral perversity might also exclude a prince fromsuccession. “A wicked son, though an only one,” says the Arthaśāstra,“should never ascend the throne”. 22 Kings sometimes nominated theirsuccessors, overriding the claims of their eldest sons if these were given toevil courses. Thus Samudra Gupta was nominated by his father, CandraGupta I, against other claimants, at a great darbār, after which the old kingapparently abdicated; and similar instances can be found. The absence of astrict rule of primogeniture was the cause of dynastic disputes, and henceundoubtedly led to the weakening of empires.Princes were trained with great care, and the heir to the throne ( yuvarāja)was often associated with his father in government. This custom waswidespread, and was especially strong with the invaders of the North-West,and with the Cōlas, whose crown princes often issued charters in their ownnames and acted independently of their fathers while the latter were still onthe throne. The Śakas and Pahlavas often inscribed the name of the rulingking on the obverse of their coins, while that of the sub-king was given onthe reverse.Princes might be a great source of danger to their parents. According to aBuddhist tradition Magadha was ruled from Ajātaśatru onwards by fiveparricides in succession, which suggests that at the time this region of Indiafollowed the widespread primitive practice of putting the king to deathwhen his vital powers failed, a practice of which the customary nature wasnot remembered by succeeding generations. Kings are warned against theintrigues both of sons and wives, “for princes, like crabs, eat their ownparents”.23 The activities of the princes must be strictly controlled, and theymust be constantly spied upon, to ensure that they will not revolt againsttheir fathers.The prince’s impatience to acquire his patrimony was often gratified by thevoluntary abdication of an elderly king-a practice approved by precept andtradition, examples of which may be found at all times and in all parts ofIndia. Sometimes the abdication was followed by religious suicide. Severalkings, the most notable being Candragupta Maurya, are said to haveabdicated and slpwly starved themselves to death under the influence ofJainism. Others passed straight to heaven by drowning in a sacred river,notably the Cālukya king Someśvara I (c. 1042–1068), who, when hispowers began to [Page 93] fail, waded into the holy Tungabhadrā anddrowned himself to the sound of religious music, while his courtiers linedthe banks. In some of the medieval principalities of Malabār the ritualsuicide of the king became a regular institution.

Other systems of inheritance prevailed in a few cases. Thus the throne of the Śaka satraps of Ujjayinī passed not to the king’s son, but to his younger brother, and only when all the brothers were dead did the eldest son of theeldest brother inherit. There are indications that brother-to-brothersuccession was not wholly unknown elsewhere in India, and it was almostregularly followed in Ceylon. This system prevailed in China under theShang dynasty (c. 1500–1100 B.C.), and was also followed by many CentralAsian tribes; it is still known in East Africa.In the early days of the Cera kingdom of Malabār inheritance wasthrough the male line, but about the 12th century a matrilinear systembecame regular, according to which the heir to the throne was not the son ofthe king, but of his eldest sister. This system, called Marumakkattāyam,continued in Cochin and Travancore until very recent times, both for royalsuccession and the inheritance of estates. Perhaps it existed in Malabār at anearly period, but was dropped by the upper classes for a while underbrāhmanical influence, to be revived in the course of centuries. Other tracesof matrilinear succession can be found in ancient India, notably in the verycommon use of metronymics in royal titles, but it was not regularlyfollowed by any important kingdoms.If the king died with no heir to the throne much power was wielded bythe magnates of the realm, for the courtiers, nobles, ministers, religiousleaders and wealthy merchants would sometimes meet together and choosea king. Thus the nobles of Kānyakubja invited Har a to assume the thronewhen Grahavarman died childless. Gopāla, the founder of the Pāla line ofBengal and Bihār, was chosen as king by the great men of the land. Afurther example is the appointment of the boy Nandivarman (755–797) asthe Pallava king of Kāñcī by an assembly of nobles and ministers. TheKashmīr Chronicle provides other instances.
## QUASI-FEUDALISM
Authorities differ on the definition of a feudal system. Some would confine the term to the complex structure of contractual relations covering the whole of society from king to villein, which prevailed in medievalEurope. Others use the term so loosely that they apply it to any systemwhere political power is chiefly in the [Page 94] hands of those who ownland. Most British historians would prefer the narrower definition,according to which ancient India never had a true feudal system. Somethingvery like European feudalism did evolve among the Rājputs after theMuslim invasions, but this is outside our period. Ancient India had,however, a system of overlordship, which was quasi-feudal, though never asfully developed as in Europe, and resting on a different basis.

In the later Vedic period there were already lesser chiefs tributary to the greater. Terms in these texts like adhirāja and samrāt, often loosely translated “emperor”, seem actually to imply lordship over a number of feudatories. Magadhan imperialism aimed at a centralized realm, thougheven in Mauryan times vassal chiefs existed in the more remote regions ofthe empire. With the fall of the Mauryas the typical large kingdom had acentral core of directly administered territory, and a circle of vassalkingdoms subordinate in varying degrees to the emperor. The vassals themselves had vassals of their own in petty local chieftains calling themselves rājās. The Indian system differed from that of Europe in that the relations of overlord and vassal were not regularly based on contract, whether theoretical or otherwise, and ancient India had nothing quit  comparable to the European manor.

When decisively defeated in battle a king might render homage to hisconqueror and retain his throne. Thus vassals usually became so byconquest rather than by contract, though the Arthaśāstra advises a weakking to render voluntary homage if necessary to a stronger neighbour. Thisstate of affairs was supported by the Epics and Smrti literature, whichdiscouraged outright conquest. “Lawful conquest” ( dharmavijaya) did notinvolve the absorption of the conquered kingdom, but merely its reductionto vassal status. Though many later kings, such as Samudra Gupta, ignoredthe Sacred Law and incorporated conquered kingdoms into their empires,custom was against such a practice.

The degrees of control of overlord over vassal varied much. Ideally the vassal was expected to pay regular tribute to his emperor, and to assist him with troops and funds in war. He attended the overlord’s court on ceremonial occasions, and the panegyrics of powerful medieval kingsregularly mention the jewels of many splendid turbans glittering like thewaves of the sea, as the vassals bow before their lord. In his charters thevassal was expected to mention the name and title of his overlord before hisown. In some cases a resident representative of the overlord was stationedat the vassal’s capital. The vassal’s sons might be educated with the princesof his master, and serve as pages, and his daughters might be demanded[Page 95] for the imperial harem. Often a vassal king acted as a minister ofhis suzerain, or a minister or favourite might be set up as a vassal king byhis master. Hence in the medieval period the status of minister often mergedwith that of vassal, and the provincial governor, holding office at the king’spleasure, tended to become a feudatory king or chief in his own right.The great vassal ( mahāsāmanta) was always very powerful, and had hisown administration and army. Among the many threats to the security of aking the revolting vassal was one of the most dangerous. The history of theWestern Deccan offers typical examples. Here, from the 6th centuryonwards, the Cālukya dynasty held sway; a vassal, Dantidurga Rāstrakūta,overthrew it and established his own dynasty about 753, and the Calukyaswere reduced to insignificant vassalage; but some 200 years later theyprofited by the weakness of the Rastrakutas to regain the hegemony, whichthey maintained until the end of the 12th century, when their vassals, theYādavas, Kākatīyas and Hoysalas, shared their domains between them.In fact the suzerain’s hand weighed very lightly on the more powerfuland remoter vassals, and many claims to homage and tribute amounted tovery little. Samudra Gupta, for instance, even claimed the king of Ceylon,Śrī Meghavarna, as his vassal; but it is clear from a reliable Chinese sourcethat the claim was based merely on the reception of a Sinhalese missionbearing gifts and requesting permission to erect a Buddhist monastery at thesacred site of Gayā.The lesser chiefs, on the other hand, had little more power than the lordsof the manor in medieval Europe, though they claimed the proud title ofrājā. In this connection an interesting story is told in an inscription atDūdhpānī, in S. Bihār, dating from the 8th century A.D.Three merchant brothers were returning from the port of Tāmraliptito their home in Ayodhyā, with a caravan of merchandise andprovisions, and rested for the night at a village calledBhramaraśālmali. Meanwhile the local king, Ādisimha, passed by on ahunting expedition, with a large train of followers, and, as was thecustom, demanded food and fodder of the villagers. But they weresuffering from a temporary shortage, and could scarcely meet thisdemand. So they sent a deputation to the merchants, who at theirrequest gave the king provisions from their own stock. The king foundthe companionship of the eldest brother, Udayamāna, very agreeable,and so he and his brothers became members of Ādisimha’s court. Oneday, Udayamāna revisited the village of Bhramaraśālmalī, and thevillagers, remembering his former kindness, asked him to become theirking. King Ādisimha approved the request, and so the merchantUdayamāna became [Page 96] rājā of Bhramaraśālmalī, while his twobrothers were made kings of adjoining villages.24This little story illustrates another means whereby quasi-feudal relationsarose. After the Mauryan period it became usual for kings to pay theirofficers and favourites not with cash, but with the right to collect revenuefrom a village or a group of villages. Such a right often carried otherprivileges, and usually made the recipient the intermediary between kingand taxpayer. It greatly encouraged the tendency towards devolution,instability, and inter-state anarchy.

## OLIGARCHIES AND REPUBLICS
Though monarchy was usual in ancient India, tribal states also existed,which were governed by oligarchies. The term “republic” is often used forthese bodies, and though it has been criticized by some authorities, it isquite legitimate if it is remembered that the ganas, or tribes, were notgoverned like the Republic of India by an assembly elected by universalsuffrage. The Roman Republic was not a democracy, but it was a republicnevertheless, and the evidence shows that in some of these ancient Indianrepublican communities a large number of persons had some say in thegovernment.

Vedic literature gives faint indications of such tribes at a very early date(p. ss), and the Buddhist scriptures recognize the existence of manyrepublics, chiefly in the foothills of the Himālayas and in N. Bihār. Thesewere mostly tributary to the greater kingdoms, but exercised internalautonomy. One such people was the Śākyas, who dwelt on the borders ofmodern Nepāl, and to whom the Buddha himself belonged. Though in laterlegend the Buddha’s father, Śuddhodhana, is depicted as a mighty kingliving in great pomp, he was in fact a tribal chief, depending on the supportof a large assembly of householders, who gathered regularly to discusstribal politics in a meeting hall (in Pāli, santhāgāra).The most powerful non-monarchical state at this time was the Vrjjianconfederacy, of which the chief element was the tribe of the Licchavis, andwhich long resisted the great Ajātaśatru. According to a rather dubiousBuddhist tradition the Licchavis had no less than 7707 rājās, a term whichmust have covered all the heads of families of the tribe who were eligible totake part in the tribal assembly. Jaina sources tell of an inner council ofthirty-six tribal chieftains controlling the affairs of the Licchavis, Mallasand allied tribes in their war with Ajātaśatru. The whole confederation had arājā-inchief, an executive head who, like the rājā of the Śākyas, seems[Page 97] to have held office for life and often to have passed on his officeto his heir.It has been reasonably suggested that the organization of the Buddhistclergy, which is said to have been laid down by the Buddha himself, ismodelled on the constitution of one of these republican tribes, perhaps theŚākyas. Buddhist monastic affairs were managed by a general meeting ofthe monks, with a regular system of procedure and standing orders, not verydifferent from that of the business meeting of a present-day society. TheBuddhist chapter differed from the modern committee, however, in that alldecisions needed the unanimous consent of the assembled monks.

Differences which could not be settled were referred to a committee of elders.

In the Buddha’s day the free tribes were standing up with difficulty to the internal pressure of changing social and economic conditions, and the external pressure of the rising kingdoms of Eastern India. We have seen that both the Śākyas and the Vrjjis were conquered at about the time of the Buddha’s death, the former never to rise again (p. 46). The Buddha himself,though a friend of kings, seems to have had a deep affection for the oldrepublican organization, and in a remarkable passage he is said to havewarned the Vrjjis shortly before his death that their security depended onmaintaining their traditions and holding regular and well attended folk-moots.Western India did not feel the force of imperialism as strongly as the east,and here republican tribes survived for much longer. Several such peoplesare mentioned in the classical accounts of Alexander’s invasion, and theArthaśādastra devotes a whole chapter to the means whereby such tribesmay be reduced to vassalage by an ambitious king-the main method beingto sow dissension between the leading tribesmen so that the tribal assemblyloses its unanimity and the tribe is divided against itself. Such a procedure,according to a Buddhist legend, was employed by Ajātaśatru’s wily ministerVassakara to weaken the Vrjjis before invasion. The Arthaśāstra probablyrefers ironically to the martial arrogance and practical ineptitude of therepublics when it states that the members of seven named tribes “make aliving by their title of rājā”. 25The Mahābhārata takes full cognisance of the existence of republicantribes in Western India, and their survival until the 5th century A.D. isattested by numerous coins and a few short inscriptions. Perhaps the mostimportant western republic was that of the Yaudheyas in NorthernRājasthān, which issued numerous coins, bearing the inscription “Victory tothe Yaudheya tribe”; one of their official seals has been found, with theproud legend, “Of the Yaudheyas, who [Page 98] possess the magic spell ofvictory” and one fragmentary Yaudheya inscription survives. This mentionsthe chief of the tribe, whose name has unfortunately been worn away by theweathering of the stone; he has the regal title of mahārāja, but he is alsocalled mahāsenāpati, or general-in-chief, and he is “placed at the head ofthe Yaudheya people”.26The Malava tribe may be the same as the Malloi described by Greekhistorians as living in Panjāb at the time of Alexander. If so, the tribemoved south during the centuries, for its coins are found in Rajasthan, andit gave its name to Malwa, the region around Ujjayinī, north of theNarmadā. Some brief 3rd-century inscriptions at Nandsā in Rājasthān referto the Mālava Śrīsoma, who “supported the ancestral yoke of government”,and whose position was therefore hereditary.27 It is probable that theMālavas founded the era later known as the Era of Vikrama, for severalearly inscriptions refer to this as “the Era handed down by the Mālavatribe”.

Most of these western tribes became tributary to the Guptas afterSamudra Gupta’s great conquests in the 4th century (p. 63). After this wehear little more of them, and they probably vanished as a result of the Hūnainvasions. We know very little of their organization, which may have beenloosely feudal, with a large number of petty chieftains more or lesssubordinate to a single head, who held office with their consent and coulddo little without their help. In any case modern India may take legitimatepride in the fact that, though she may not have had democracies in themodern sense, government by discussion was by no means unknown in herancient civilization.

## COUNCILLORS AND OFFICIALS
“A single wheel cannot turn”, says the Arthaśātra, rather inaccurately,“and so government is only possible with assistance. Therefore a kingshould appoint councillors and listen to their advice.”28 At the head ofaffairs was a small body of elder statesmen, whom the king was advised tochoose with the utmost care. The size of this privy council ( mantri-parisad)varied, and the authorities suggest figures ranging from seven to thirty-seven; we have little evidence of its size in practice, but it seems more oftento have approached the smaller of these figures than the larger.

The council was not a cabinet in the modern sense, but an advisory body,with few corporate functions. Thus the king is in one place advised to layhis most secret plans before only one member of the council, to avoidleakage. The council’s purpose was primarily to [Page 99] advise and aidthe king, and not to govern; but it was no mere rubberstamping body, for allauthorities stress that councillors should speak freely and openly, and thatthe king should give full consideration to their advice.

In fact the council often exerted great powers. It might transact business in the king’s absence, and the Aśokan inscriptions show that it might make minor decisions without consulting him. The gaka satrap Rudradāman (p.  62) referred the question of rebuilding the Girnar dam to his councillors, who advised against it, so that he was forced to undertake the work against their advice, apparently at the expense of the privy purse and not of publicfunds. The Kashmīr Chronicle gives one case of a privy council deposingthe king, and another of its vetoing the king’s nomination of his successor.At its meetings the council took the strictest precautions to preservesecrecy of deliberations, for agents of the king’s enemies at home or abroadwere constantly in search of information. The texts advise that women,notoriously unreliable, and even talking birds such as parrots and mynahs,whose vocal powers were much overestimated in ancient India, should beexcluded from the vicinity of the council chamber. Though the Arthaśāstra advises the king to appoint ministers by meritalone it would seem that in later times most of the privy councillors, andindeed of the whole civil service of the kingdom, enjoyed their positions byvirtue of inheritance. Candella inscriptions show that a line of fivegenerations of councillors held office during the reigns of seven generationsof kings, and there are many similar examples.Sometimes a minister succeeded in obtaining complete control of akingdom, and the king became a mere puppet. This tendency wasexemplified in later times in the Marāthā state, where the descendants ofŚivājī were completely eclipsed by the Peshwās, or hereditary ministers,and a similar state of affairs has prevailed in Nepāl until the present day. Inancient India there were many cases of ministerial usurpation and ofministers who became de facto rulers under weak kings. The aged RāmaRāja of Vijayanagara (p. 77), who lost the battle of Tālikota, and thusbrought about the end of the last great empire of Hindu India, was not thelegal king, but the hereditary minister of the insignificant Sadasiva, whowas later murdered by Rama Rajā’s brother.

The functions of the councillors were not always sharply defined or delimited, and terminology varied considerably. There seems usually to have been a chief counsellor, the mantrin par excellence, often called “great counsellor” ( mahāmantrin). With orthodox [Page 100] kings the purohita or court chaplain was very influential, and one source even suggests that before coming to a final decision the king should deliberate privately with him.29 The treasurer and chief taxcollector (called in the ArthaśāstrasannidhātR and samāhartR respectively), were important, as was the“minister of peace and war” ( sāndhivigrahika), a title which does notappear until Gupta times. This minister approximated to the foreignsecretary of the modern state, but had more definite military functions andoften accompanied the king on campaign. The prāDivāka, or chief judgeand legal advisor, seems to have been important in medieval Hindukingdoms, and the senāpati, or general, was always influential, while themahāk apa alika, or chief record keeper and secretary no doubt attendedthe council meetings.

In theory neither the king nor his council were legislative bodies in the modern sense of the term. The royal decrees ( Śāsana) which they promulgated were not generally new laws, but orders referring to specialcases. Dharma and established custom were usually looked on as inviolable,and the king’s commands were merely applications of the Sacred Law.Heterodox kings, however, did from time to time issue orders which were inthe nature of new laws, the most notable case being AŚoka.To transmit the royal decrees a corps of secretaries and clerks wasmaintained, and remarkable precautions were taken to prevent error. Underthe Cō as, for instance, orders were first written by scribes at the king’sdictation, and the accuracy of the drafts was attested by competentwitnesses. Before being sent to their recipients they were carefullytranscribed, and a number of witnesses, sometimes amounting to as many asthirteen, again attested them. In the case of grants of land and privileges animportant court official was generally deputed to ensure that the royaldecrees were put into effect. Thus records were kept with great care, andnothing was left to chance; the royal scribes themselves were oftenimportant personages.Councillors and high officials in general are often referred to in earlysources as mahāmātras, and from Gupta times onwards as kumārāmātyas,or “princely ministers”; the latter epithet seems to have been a title ofhonour. There was no high degree of specialization, and councillors, likemodern cabinet ministers, often changed their posts. All of them, even agedministers of the brahman class, might perform military functions. In somesources they are divided into two groups-deliberative officials ( matisacivaor dhīsaciva), and executive officials ( karmasaciva). The former werecouncillors, while the latter approximately corresponded to high-rankingcivil servants of modern times.

[Page 101] Of the seven occupational classes into which Megasthenes divided all the inhabitants of India, two were connected with the government; the last of the seven, “those who deliberate on public affairs”, must represent the councillors, while the penultimate class of “overseers” are the adhyak as or superintendents of the Arthaśāstra. As well as most of
the officials we have mentioned this text enumerates many others-the superintendents of crown lands, of forests of forest-produce, of state herds, of waste lands, of the treasury, and of mines, the chief goldsmith, the comptroller of state granaries, the superintendent of commerce, of tolls and customs, of state spinning and weaving workshops, of slaughter houses, of passports, and of shipping. Military requirements were cared for by the superintendents of the armoury, of cavalry, of elephants, of chariots, and of footmen, all of whom seem to have been rather civil than military officials, as far as it is possible to draw a dividing line between them in ancient India.The less reputable amusements of the populace were controlled by thesuperintendents of liquor, of gaming, and of prostitutes. Asoka inaugurateda further class of official called dharma-mahāmātra, or minister ofRighteousness, whose duty was to supervise the affairs of all religiousbodies, and to ensure that the officials followed the Emperor’s new policy;this class of official existed under different titles in some later empires, asdid officers who administered the great royal donations to religiousestablishments.

Thus in Mauryan times every aspect of the life of the individual was watched over, and as far as possible controlled, by the government. Though no later state developed the same degree of control as the Mauryas, the ideal of the Arthaśāstra did not wholly disappear. Not only did the government regulate the economic life of the country, but it also took an important part in it. All mines, which term included, for the ancient Indian,pearl fisheries and salt pans, were owned by the state, and were eitherworked directly with the labour of criminals or serfs, or let out toentrepreneurs, from whom the king claimed a percentage of their output asroyalty. The produce of the forests, from elephants to firewood, was theproperty of the state. There were large state farms, cultivated either bydirect labour or on a share-cropping basis, the products of which went to thestate granaries. The state owned manufactories for spinning and weaving,which were staffed by indigent women, rather like the houses of industryunder the Elizabethan poor-law. Munitions of war were made in statearsenals, and ships were built in state shipyards, to be let out to fishermenand merchants. In fact there was no question of laissez-faire in ancientIndia.[Page 102] This highly organized bureaucracy was much tied up with“red tape”. The Arthaśāstra 30 suggests that departments should be headedby more than one chief, to prevent excessive peculation, and to ensure thatno one individual grew too powerful; the text adds that officials should betransferred frequently and states that no government servant should beallowed to take any decision without reference to his superior, except inemergency.The Arthaśāstra envisages the payment of the many officials of the statein cash, and gives a lengthy tariff of salaries. 31 This is very obscure,however, since bare figures are quoted, without specifying the type of coinor the period of payment. The period was probably a month, and the coinswere pa as, but these might be either silver or copper. Whatever they were,the list makes it clear that the crown servant of ancient India, like the Indiancivil servant of modern times, enjoyed a standard of life much above that ofhis less fortunate fellows. The chief councillor, the purohita, the heirapparent, the chief queen, the queen-mother, the king’s preceptor, and thechief sacrificial priest of the palace received 48,000 pa as monthly, while atthe lower end of the scale even palace workmen, attendants, andbodyguards received sixty. In contrast to these a labourer on the crownlands received only one and a quarter pa a and provisions.32 The last figureis so low that we cannot but believe that the coin referred to by theArthaśāstra was a silver one, otherwise a single copper cooking pot wouldcost more than the labourer’s annual wage.

These data apply to the Mauryan epoch, or to the period immediately following it. Later it became usual for kings to reward their officers by grants of the revenue of a village or district, a system not unknown even in earlier times, and which, as we have seen, helped in the development of the quasi-feudal system of medieval India.

## LOCAL ADMINISTRATION
The ancient Indian kingdom was divided into provinces and these into divisions and districts, all with very variable terminology. In the Maurya and Gupta periods the provincial governor was appointed directly by the king, and was usually a member of the royal family. In later times his status was often hereditary and he approximated to a vassal king. We can see thedevelopment of this in a series of inscriptions from Western Bengal, issuedby the governors of the Gupta emperors in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. 33Here we read of three successive generations of governors, of whom thefirst, Ciratadatta, is merely an uparika, a viceroy; with the [Page 103]decline of the central administration under Budha Gupta his successors callthemselves uparika-mahārāja, and are well on the way to becoming kings,holding office by birth rather than by appointment. Numerous independentdynasties did in fact arise through provincial governors growing too strongfor their masters.

District governors were not usually appointed from the centre, but by the provincial governors. Like the District Officers of the Indian Civil Service, they combined judicial and administrative functions. At this level, in some parts of India at least, the government was assisted by a council, for from the Gupta inscriptions already mentioned we find that the decisions of the district officer were made after consultation with a body of leadingresidents which included the chief banker, the chief caravan leader, thechief craftsman, and the chief scribe. These members of the council were nodoubt heads of guilds or castes, and probably held office by hereditary right.In the Peninsula, especially under the Cō as, similar district councilsexisted, and had even wider powers, levying local taxes and exercisingjudicial functions with the concurrence of the representative of the centralgovernment.Cities too had their councils. Megasthenes’ description of thegovernment of Pā aliputra by a committee of thirty members divided intosix sub-committees is not exactly confirmed elsewhere, and some doubtshave been cast on his accuracy. But some cities issued their own coinage,and must therefore have had considerable local autonomy. Councils existedin small towns and large villages in various parts of India, especially the Cōa country, where they were very vigorous.In general the most important element in city administration was thegovernor ( nāgaraka, purapāla). His chief responsibilities were revenuecollection, and the preservation of law and order by means of police, secretagents and troops, which were stationed in the chief towns under a captain( da anāyaka), who might be the governor himself. The watchmen orpolice were sometimes fierce and oppressive, and amongst the privilegesgiven to brāhman villages by benevolent kings immunity from entry bypolice was one of the most valued.

The system of government envisaged by the Arthaśāstra involved a careful check on the movements and activities of all the inhabitants of the city through petty officials called gopa, probably often working in a part- time capacity, who were responsible for the collection of revenue, and the supervision of forty households each. These men not only kept careful note of the births, deaths, income and expenditure in the families under their charge, but even of the visitors they received and of any importantdevelopments in the [Page 104] households. The information obtained bythe gopa was passed on to the town office and permanently recorded, andsimilar records were kept in the villages. We cannot be sure that the systemadvocated by the Arthaśāstra was ever wholly put into effect, butMegasthenes confirms that registers were maintained and the movements ofstrangers carefully supervised. It would seem, in fact, that conditions in thelarger Mauryan cities approximated to those of a modern police state, withthe open supervision of the gopas supplemented by a vigorous secretservice.

The city governor had other, more positive duties. He was responsible for the cleanliness of the streets and the prevention of fire. His duties also involved the prevention or alleviation of such disasters as famine, flood andplague. Thus the last record we have of the Girnar dam tells how it burst,and was reconstructed by the local city governor, Cakrapālita, in 455,during the reign of Skanda Gupta. 34 Cakrapālita, the son of the provincialgovernor Parnadatta, is praised in the inscription commemorating therebuilding of the dam in terms which are evidently formal panegyric, butcertain passages are quite unexpected, and depict the city governor as apopular figure on the most friendly terms with the citizens. In any case,these verses show us the ideal set before the local official in Gupta times,and are therefore very significant.

“He caused distress to no man in the city, but he chastised the wicked.

Even in this mean age he did not fail the trust of the people.

He cherished the citizens as his own children and he put down crime.

He delighted the inhabitants with gifts and honours and smiling
conversation,
and he increased their love with informal visits and friendly
receptions.”


## VILLAGE ADMINISTRATION
At all times the village was the unit of government. In the South, andoccasionally in the North, districts were classified according to the numberof villages they were supposed to contain, for instance the Gangāvādi96,000 or the Nidgundige 12. The number of villages supposed to exist inthe larger units is evidently exaggerated, but it must be remembered thatalmost any settlement, even a tiny group of huts in a jungle clearing,qualified for the name of grāma; but a grāma might also contain as many as1,000 families, and there was no clear dividing-line between a village and atown.

PLATE XXVI
[Page 105] From pre-Mauryan times collectors were appointed over groups of villages, and in the villages themselves two elements, which survive to the present day, represented the last link in the chain of governmental control. These were the village headman and the village council.The headman’s was normally a hereditary position, though he wasfrequently looked on as the king’s representative, to be replaced at hispleasure. He was usually one of the wealthier peasants, and wasremunerated with tax-free land, dues in kind, or both. In the larger villageshe was a very important functionary, with a small staff of village officials,such as an accountant, a watchman and a toll-collector. These offices toowere often passed from father to son, and were remunerated in the sameway as that of the headman.

In some sources the headman seems an oppressive local tyrant. The gāmabhojaka, who appears in numerous Pāli Jātaka stories, is not so much the representative of his people and one of their number as a squire, withwide powers over the villagers, fining them for minor offences andexpelling them for serious ones. In more than one passage in this source weread of villagers appealing to the king for protection against wickedheadmen. Usually, however, the headman appears rather as the champion ofthe villagers. He was responsible for the defence of the village, and in theSouth, where the village council received greater recognition, this was hismost important function. Villages were liable to raids from neighbouringkingdoms, or by the wild tribesmen of hill and jungle. In less settled timesbandits roamed the country in large gangs, and Āryans and Dravidians alikehad a very ancient tradition of cattle-raiding. When the central governmentwas weak, village feuds and cattle-raids might lead to pitched battles. Allover the Deccan are to be found “hero-stones” ( vīragal) recording the deathof a village warrior, often the headman, “while defending the cattle”. Thepseudo-Śukra, writing in the late Middle Ages, speaks of the headman asthe mother and father of the village, protecting it from robbers, from theking’s enemies, and from the oppressions of the king’s officers.35 By thistime the headman seems often to have been incorporated into the quasi-feudal system. The merchant Udayamāna (p. 95f), for instance, thoughdignified by the title of rājā, was in fact little more than a village headman.

The village council is rarely referred to in most sources, though it certainly existed all over India. In most kingdoms it was not recognized as part of the state machine. One lawbook gives it a brief mention, 36 and statesthat its powers derive from the king, but [Page 106] this is certainly a falseinterpretation. There is no evidence that the rights of the village councilever depended on the delegation of royal power. It was independent of thegovernment and continued to function, whatever dynasty was ruling thedistrict. Southern kings, however, seem increasingly to have given itrecognition, and hence in the Cō a empire it played an important part inadministration.

We have no record of the composition of the village council in the North,where in later times it traditionally consisted of five of the most respectedvillagers, including the headman. The Southern councils had constitutionsthat differed according to local custom. In some villages of the WesternDeccan all householders attended the village meeting, although they mayhave had chiefs who formed an inner council. Elsewhere villages weregoverned by committees, often chosen by lot. At Uttaramērūr, in the Cō akingdom, a large village inhabited by brāhmans ( agrahāra), a number ofinscriptions from the 10th century onwards throw much light on localpolitics. The village was divided into thirty wards or sections, each ofwhich had a representative on the council, chosen annually by lot. Thecouncil was divided into five sub-committees, the first three of which wereresponsible for gardens and orchards, tanks and irrigation, and thesettlement of disputes respectively, while the functions of the last two areuncertain. Members were unpaid, and could be removed from office formisconduct. The right to sit on the council was limited by a propertyqualification of a house and a small plot of land. Membership was confinedto men between the ages of thirty-five and seventy, and those who hadserved for a year were ineligible for reappointment for another three years.

The two latter features of the Uttaramērūr constitution are also found inthe constitutions of other villages of which records have survived. All seemto have closed their councils both to youth and old age, and in some theminimum age was as high as forty. Most had checks on the reappointmentof retiring members, no doubt to avoid corruption and to prevent anyindividual from growing too influential. In one case even close relatives ofa retiring member were debarred from membership for five years, and inanother the retiring member could not be reappointed for ten years.

These Southern councils not only arbitrated disputes and managed socialaffairs outside the jurisdiction of the government, but were responsible forrevenue collection, assessing individual contributions and negotiating thevillage’s collective assessment with the king’s representative. They hadvirtual ownership of the village’s waste land, with right of sale, and theywere active in irrigation, road-building, and other public works. Theirtransactions, recorded on the [Page 107] walls of village temples, show avigorous community life, and are a permanent memorial to the best side ofearly Indian politics.

## PUBLIC FINANCE
All ancient Indian authorities on statecraft stress the importance of a full treasury for successful government, and India had evolved a regular system of taxation before the Mauryan period. At all times the basic tax was the taxon land, usually called bhāga or “share”, which was a fixed proportion ofthe crop. The figure generally given in the Smrti literature is one sixth, butMegasthenes gives it as one quarter, while the Arthaśāstra suggests onequarter or even one third for fertile lands; there is some reason to believethat one quarter was the proportion generally levied even in the mild reignof Aśoka. The tax was usually paid in kind, and the Jātakas refer to theroyal officers measuring out grain on the threshing floor for conveyance tothe king’s granary; but in the middle ages, especially in the South, manyvillages had commuted their land tax for a regular annual cash payment.

Numerous exemptions and remissions were granted; thus land broughtnewly under the plough was not taxed fully for five years, while the taxmight be wholly or partially remitted in times of bad harvest. Remissionsmight also be given to a village embarking on a collective irrigation projector some other enterprise in the public interest. Generally the tax was leviedon the gross yield, but sometimes an allowance was made to cover therequirements for consumption and seed until the next harvest, and somemedieval Indian assessmentsseem to have been levied on the net yield only.According to the Sacred Law women, children, students, learnedbrahmans and ascetics should not be taxed in any form, and many grants oftax-free land were made to brāhmans and temples; but in practice evenreligious establishments often paid tax, though at a lower rate than theordinary peasant. At the other extreme, classes which society in generaldisliked often had to pay extra taxes, especially in the South; these includedthose who followed objectionable trades, such as leather workers, andfollowers of heterodox faiths, such as Muslims and Ājīvikas (p. 294ff).

As well as the basic land tax several other taxes fell upon the cultivator, such as fixed annual cash payments, and dues for the use of water from a tank or canal owned by the king. Taxes were paid on cattle and other livestock, and on all kinds of agricultural and dairy produce. Peasants in South India often paid house taxes, and taxes were also levied on shops and necessary industrial equipment such [Page 108] as looms, potters’ wheels and oil presses. Many of these lesser taxes were the perquisites of the local council, and were devoted to the needs of the village.

According to the Arthaśāstra merchants travelling from place to place paid small road tolls which were collected by an officer called antapāla, who was responsible for the upkeep of the road and its safety. If we are to believe the text these taxes formed a sort of insurance, for the antapala wasexpected to make good any loss suffered by the merchants from thieves. Itis doubtful whether this system was regularly adopted in later times, whenkingdoms were less well organized, but something like it must haveprevailed in the Mauryan period. Tolls were also levied at the city gates onincoming merchandise, on a varying ad valorem tariff. The Arthaśāstrasuggests that essential goods such as grain, oil, sugar, pots and cheaptextiles should be taxed at one-twentieth of their value, and other goods atrates varying from one fifteenth to one fifth. Various market dues were alsolevied, but the ten per cent sales tax recorded by Megasthenes is nowherementioned in an Indian source.All craftsmen were expected to devote one or two days’ work per monthto the king, but this tax was probably often commuted to a sort of incometax on average daily earnings. There was also liability to forced labour ( vii), though this does not seem always to have fallen very heavily upon themasses. Services in labour and gifts of provisions were expected by the kingand his officers when on tour, and this might put small rural communitiesinto serious difficulties (p. 95). Such obligations of forced labour andservice prevailed in some Indian states until very recent times.

So complex a system of taxation could not be maintained without surveying and accountancy. The Jātaka stories refer to local officers as “holders of the [surveyor’s] cord” ( rajjugāhaka), and the officers called in the Aśokan inscriptions rajjūka may have been the same; Megasthenesrecords that the land was thoroughly surveyed. Land was only transferred toa new owner after reference to the local land records, and this fact, with thename of the record keepers who had certified its transferability, was oftennoted in the copper-plate title deeds. The better organized kingdomsevidently kept full and up-todate records of land ownership correspondingto the English Domesday Book. Unfortunately they were written onperishable materials, and all have long since vanished.Taxation was burdensome, especially in times of bad harvest or underrapacious kings. There are numerous references in Jātaka stories to theharsh exactions of local officers, and to peasants emigrating en masse fromtheir villages to escape crushing taxation. In [Page 109] later South Indianinscriptions we read of something like the rentstrikes of later times, and of awhole village council being imprisoned for failure to pay tax. Oneinscription records an appeal to the Cō a emperor Rājarāja I, in protestagainst the looting of a village in punishment of tax default; in this case theking upheld the action of his local officers. A defaulting taxpayer was liableto eviction, though he might be given a year’s grace or more in case of real need.

The textbooks on statecraft invariably stress the danger of unduly heavy taxation. Nobody can hold honey in his mouth without tasting some of it, and it is to be expected that local officers will claim more tax than their due,but really extortionate collectors are a great danger to the king’s safety.Certain admirable general principles are laid down in our sources-taxationshould never act as a check on trade and industry; the king should tax as abee sucks honey, without hurting the flower; taxes should be fixed so asalways to allow a profit to the taxpayer; articles of commerce should not betaxed more than once; increases in taxation should not be imposed withoutdue warning. No doubt the better monarchs tried to maintain theseprinciples in their fiscal policy.

Taxation was theoretically justified as a return for the protection granted
by the king. In the story of the primeval king, Manu (p. 86), it is said that
when Brahmā first appointed him he demurred, fearing that he would be
responsible for the sins of the people; but the people were so direly in need
of government that they promised that their sins would be upon their own
heads, and undertook to give Manu a share of their crops and herds if he
would protect them. The Buddhist story of the first king (p. 82) records a
similar promise as part of the contract. Generally it is stated that the king is
only entitled to tax his people if he protects them, and that he obtains in
addition a share of the religious merit acquired by them, especially by his
brāhman subjects; if he fails in his duty he has no moral right to receive tax,
and reaps a share of all the demerit accruing to his subjects.

On the other hand more than one source speaks of the king as the ownerof all the land and water in his kingdom; the corollary of this propositionwould be that the tax on crops and the other products of the earth was a sortof rent in return for tenancy. That this idea, as well as the doctrine oftaxation in return for protection, underlay ancient Indian practice, is evidentfrom the fact that the king had the right to evict defaulting peasants, that heclaimed the reversion of the property of those dying without heirs, that he sometimes demanded a fee comparable to the medieval European heriotbefore a holding was transferred to the heirs of a dead householder, and that[Page 110] he was the owner of treasure trove. Manu speaks of the king asultimate lord ( adhipati) of the land,37 and therefore entitled to his share oftreasure and minerals. Bha asvāmin, the medieval commentator on theArthaśāstra, declares bluntly that the king is lord of land and water, but thatother things are the property of individual householders. 38 His statement isborne out by several other sources, and by the record of Megasthenes. Morethan one legend tells of kings giving away or trying to give away theirkingdoms, as though they were personal property.

A few sources, however, reject the idea of the king’s ultimate ownership of the land. Thus in a Jataka story a king tells his mistress that he cannot give her his kingdom, for he is not its owner. When a legendary king, Viśvakarman Bhauvana, gave land to the priests, the goddess of earth rose up in person and rebuked him, saying that he had no right to give her away.  A medieval commentator, probably basing his statement on this old story, says that kings cannot give away land, because it is owned in common.39 The 16th century jurist Nīlakantha states that land is the property of its owner, and kings have only the right to tax it; he adds that a gift of landdoes not imply a gift of the soil itself, but only of the right to make use ofit. 40The attempts of some scholars to prove that the idea of the royalownership of land never existed in ancient India seems to have sprung fromthe implicit presupposition, perhaps derived from the laissez-faire socialphilosophy of Herbert Spencer, that there was something primitive andshameful in such a conception. It is noteworthy that those authorities whodenied royal ownership most forcibly were also those who overstressed thedemocratic element in the ancient Indian way of life. Such patriotic scholars

as Dr. K. P. Jāyaswāl, writing when India’s independence had not been
achieved, did much to give her people faith in themselves, and therefore
may have served a practical purpose. Now, with a free India, there can be
no excuse for attempting to force the interpretation of texts whose meaning
is perfectly obvious, in order to try to prove that the king laid no claim to
ownership of the land and water of his domains. On this question, as on
many others, ancient Indian opinion differed, 41 but our sources show that
the majority of thinkers on the subject favoured the doctrine of royal
ownership.

Whatever the theory, we may assume that in practice the royal ownership
weighed lightly on the peasant who paid his taxes regularly; but the
Arthaśāstra suggests that not only tax defaulters but also peasants who
failed to cultivate their holdings efficiently should be evicted, though we
have no evidence that this was regularly done.

[Page 111] The system which we have outlined was followed with many
variations in normal times throughout pre-Muslim India; but in emergencies
whips might be changed for scorpions. According to the theorists a king in
serious financial straits was justified in adopting the most drastic and
oppressive measures, rather than lose his throne. He might raise taxes
indefinitely, levy forced loans and benevolences from wealthy people,
resume grants and immunities promised in perpetuity, confiscate the
hoarded wealth of goldsmiths and even rob religious establishments,
especially those of heterodox sects. There is good evidence from the
Kashmīr chronicle and elsewhere that kings did sometimes go to these
extreme lengths. In fairness, however, it must be pointed out that the
theorists give as justifiable motives for such extortion not only danger from
external and internal enemies, but the hunger of the poor through famine,
flood or plague.

We know much about the income of the Indian king, but comparatively
little about his expenditure. Much of the income of the state was stored, and
the wealth of even small kingdoms is attested by foreign travellers and by
the records of the booty obtained by Muslim invaders. The late textbook on
polity ascribed to Śukra states that the total annual income of an emperor
might amount to 500 m. kar as, by which term the author probably means
silver coins of about the weight of the modern rupee, but with much greater

purchasing power. Of this considerable income Śukra advises the king to
reserve one sixth in his treasury.42 According to accepted theory a well-
stocked treasury was the king’s chief source of strength, and no kingdom
could function properly without it. The effect of this doctrine was certainly
bad. The great reserves of precious metals and jewels, never touched except
in direst emergency, were economically useless, and the treasury of a king
was inevitably the target of the greed of his neighbours. The royal treasures,
the existence of which was reported by early Muslim travellers, were
important factors in encouraging the invasions which ultimately destroyed
Hindu India.

After storing one sixth of his income in his treasury the king was advised
by Śukra to allot one half to what is nowadays called defence —a
euphemism which many Indian kings would have scorned. This proportion
of expenditure on military needs probably does not compare unfavourably
with that of many modern states. One twelfth of the revenue was for the
king’s personal use, and one twelfth for charity, chiefly no doubt to
religious causes. A further twelfth was devoted to the payment of civil
servants, and the last twelfth to prak taya. This term is very ambiguous in
many contexts, since it [Page 112] may mean either ministers or subjects. In
the former case it would overlap somewhat with the previous head of
expenditure, and it may be that Śukra intended it to apply to works of public
value, such as the building of roads, canals and tanks, which were certainly
undertaken by many Indian kings, and which would not otherwise be
covered by any head in the list.



LEGAL LITERATURE
With the passage of time the sacrificial instructions of the Brāhmanas
became obscure, and a new group of texts was composed to elucidate them.

These were Śrauta Sūtras: the term sūtra literally means “thread”, but was
used with the secondary meaning of a manual of instruction in the form of
brief aphorisms; the whole title may be translated “Manuals Explaining the
Scriptures”. A little later G hya Sūtras were composed on domestic
religious ceremonies, and finally manuals of human conduct, the Dharma
Sūtras. A set of three sūitras, one on each of these topics, and attributed to
the same legendary sage, was called a Kalpa Sūtra. The Dharma Sūtras are
our earliest sources for Hindu law, the most important being those attributed
to Gautama, Baudhāyana, Vasi ha and Āpastamba. They were probably
mainly composed between the 6th and the 2nd centuries B.C., but in some
respects they look back to earlier times, while they contain later
interpolations. The first three seem to have been written in a more westerly
part of India than the early Buddhist scriptures, with which they are
approximately contemporary, and the Āpastamba may have been composed
in the Northern Deccan.

Later, from the early centuries of the Christian era onwards, the prose
sūtras, including several now lost to us, were expanded and remodelled in
verse form. These are the Dharma Śāstras (“Instructions in the Sacred
Law”). The latter term is sometimes used for the Dharma Sūstras also, but
most modern authorities reserve it for the longer versified texts of later
days. There are numerous Dharma Sastras, the earliest of which is that of
Manu, probably composed in its final form in the 2nd or 3rd century A.D.

Other important Dharma Sastras after Manu are those of Yājñavalkya, Vi
u and Nārada, which date from the Gupta period and the Middle Ages, and
there are numerous others of less importance, or preserved in a fragmentary
form. Manu is still largely concerned with human conduct generally, but the
works of his successors approach more and more closely to purely legal
textbooks.



The Sūtras and Śāstras taken together are known as Smrti
(“remembered”), as distinct from the earlier Vedic literature, which [Page
113] is Śruti (“heard”), and which was believed to have been directly
revealed to its authors, and therefore of greater sanctity than the later texts.

Thus the Mānava Dharma Śāstra, or lawbook of Manu, is often known as
the Manu-Smrti. The Epics and Puranas were also looked on as Smrti, and
contain much legal lore. In fact hundreds of verses in Manu are also to be
found in the Mahābhārata, and were probably not plagiarized, but inherited
from a common source.

Many medieval jurists wrote lengthy commentaries on the Smrti
literature. Of these the most important was Vijñāneśvara, who wrote at the
court of the great Cālukya emperor, Vikramāditya VI (c. 1075–1127). His
Mitāk arā, a commentary on the lawbook of Yājñavalkya, played a very
important part in forming the civil law of modern India. Other important
jurists of the middle ages were Hemadri (c. 1300), and Jāmūtavāhana (12th
century), whose treatise on inheritance ( Dāyabhāga), part of a great
compilation called Dharmaratna, has also influenced the law of modern
India.

It cannot be too strongly stressed that the whole Smrti literature is the
work of brāhmans, who wrote from their own point of view. The
Arthaśāstra, written from a more secular angle, differs from the Smrtis in
many particulars. It is certain that the advice of the Sm tis was not regularly
followed in many ancient kingdoms, though it became increasingly
authoritative with time. The statements of the Smrtis must as far as possible
be checked by comparison with the Arthaśāstra and by passing references
to law and custom in general literature, inscriptions, and the writings of
foreign travellers.



THE BASIS OF LAW
Though we know very little about the legal system of the Ṛg Vedic
period it is clear that the idea of a divine cosmic order already existed. ta,
the regularity of the universal process, was perhaps the forerunner of the
later concept of Dharma. The latter word, etymologically akin to the
English word “form”, is untranslatable, and had many meanings. In the
Aśokan inscriptions and some other Buddhist sources it seems to have the
broad general meaning of “righteousness”; but in legal literature it may
perhaps be defined as the divinely ordained norm of good conduct, varying
according to class and caste. In this context we translate it as the “Sacred
Law”.

As well as Dharma there are, according to the textbooks, other bases of
law: contract, custom and royal ordinance. The earlier religious lawbooks
give little attention to these, but their importance increases with time. It was
recognized that, owing to the decadence of the age, Dharma was not now
known in its fullness and purity and [Page 114] therefore supplementary
sources of law were needed. Generally Dharma was thought to override all
other bases of law, but the Arthaśāstra and one other lawbook43 maintain
that the royal ordinance overrides the others, a doctrine which we must
ascribe to the totalitarianism of the Mauryas, and which few jurists would
have supported.

The king’s duty of protection was chiefly the protection of Dharma, and
as protector of Dharma he was Dharma incarnate. From Asoka onwards
kings sometimes assumed the title Dharmarāja, which was also one of the
names of Yama, the god of death and the departed. Both Yama and the king
maintained the Sacred Law by punishing evil-doers and rewarding the
righteous.

Another concept, much in evidence in some sources, was that of Da a.

The primary meaning of this word is “a stick”, from which its secondary
meanings may be easily inferred. In varying contexts it may be translated as
“military force”, “coercion”, “punishment”, “a fine”, or simply “justice”.

Human nature was evil and corrupt. In the benighted age in which most
ancient Indian writers on law and morals believed themselves to be living
mankind could only be disciplined to observe the Sacred Law by fear of
punishment. In the stern words of Manu:
“If the king did not inflict punishment untiringly on evil-doers the
stronger would roast the weaker, like fish upon a spit….

“The whole world is controlled by punishment, for a guiltless man is
hard to find….

“Where dark and red-eyed Punishment walks the land, destroying
sinners, the people are not harassed, if he who inflicts it is
discerning.” 44
The king’s responsibility for maintaining Dharma by means of Danda
was not taken lightly. Impartial administration of justice brought him the
same spiritual reward as Vedic sacrifices. Kings failing in their duty
suffered in Hell. Even delay in justice was visited with dire penalties, for a
legendary king called Nrga was reborn as a lizard, because he kept two
litigants waiting in a dispute over a cow. Some sources declared that it was
incumbent upon a king to restore the full value of stolen articles to the
plaintiff, if the thief could not be brought to justice. Moreover, the king was
[Page 115] believed to incur the demerit of criminals not brought to book,
and to suffer in the next life accordingly, while from the secular point of
view the king who perverted justice or was negligent in its administration
was in danger of losing his throne.



CRIME
Megasthenes speaks of the Indians as remarkably law-abiding, and states
that crime was very rare; similar evidence is given by Fa-hsien and by
medieval Arab travellers, though Hsüan Tsang gives a somewhat less
favourable picture. The impressions of foreign travellers are not wholly
confirmed by Indian sources, however, and a profound sense of the
insecurity of life and property underlies much of the legal literature.

In the earlier part of the period with which we deal, a process was going
on in some ways comparable to that which is now taking place in parts of
Africa. Uncivilized or semi-civilized tribes were breaking up under the
pressure of Āryan Culture; even as early as Mauryan times villages were
often overpopulated; many poor folk from the country and the hills drifted
to the towns, as they are doing at the present day, and found life even more
difficult than in their old surroundings. Some of these unfortunate and
uprooted people provided the submerged tenth of habitual criminals which
seems to have existed in all ancient Indian cities. In order to suppress crime
the Arthaśāstra advises the imposition of a stringent curfew from about two
and a half hours after sunset to the same time before dawn. Later sources
speak of castes of professional thieves who had developed stealing to a fine
art, and who made use of written manuals on their profession.

Crime was equally rampant in the countryside, where the existence of
large robber bands is attested from the time of the Buddha onwards. Hsüan
Tsang gives the earliest account of hereditary bandits who robbed their
victims and murdered them as a religious duty, like the later thugs. Trading
caravans were heavily guarded, but were nevertheless frequently plundered
by highwaymen. Thus ancient India was faced with a very serious crime
problem, though the evidence of most of the foreign travellers suggests that
the best ancient Indian kings managed to cope with it. Crime was
suppressed through the local officers and garrison commanders, who had
large staffs of police and soldiers, as well as secret agents who served as
detectives. Watchmen kept guard through the night in city and village, and
in some medieval kingdoms special officers ( duhsādhasādhanika) were
deputed to track down and apprehend bandits.



ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
[Page 116]
In the small kingdoms to which the early Dharma Sūtras refer the king
might be the sole source of justice and indeed his own executioner, striking
down condemned thieves with his mace; but in general the administration
of justice was delegated, the king’s court being reserved for appeals and
serious crime against the state. In medieval kingdoms, the councillor called
Prādvivaka, the king’s chief legal adviser, seems to have been responsible
for justice and might also himself act as a judge.

The composition of the courts varied with time and place, but the
evidence indicates that ancient India preferred a bench of magistrates to a
single judge. A Jātaka story tells of a bench of five magistrates, all of
whom, incidentally, are corrupt, while the Arthaśāstra advises that a court
with a bench of three magistrates be set up for every ten villages, with
higher courts in districts and provinces. Manu suggests a bench consisting
of the Pradvivaka and three lesser judges, while the drama called “The
Little Clay Cart” (p. 441) contains a scene in a court of justice, presided
over by a chief judge, here called adhikara ika, a wealthy merchant ( śre
hin), and a representative of the caste of scribes ( kāyastha). The title given
to the chief judge is derived from adhikarana, “a government office”, and
suggests that he was an official who combined judicial and administrative
functions; the two other magistrates were evidently leading citizens, who
served on the bench as do our justices of the peace.

Though judicial corruption is often referred to, the standards set for
judges and magistrates were very high; they were to be learned, religious,
devoid of anger, and as impartial as humanly possible. To prevent bribery it
is suggested that no private interviews should be allowed between judges
and litigants until cases are settled. The Arthaśāstra advises that the honesty
of judges should be periodically tested by agents provocateurs, while the Vi
u Smrti prescribes banishment and forfeiture of all property for a judge
found guilty of corruption or injustice—the most severe penalty a brāhman
could incur under the Sacred Law.

False witness was generally looked on with great abhorrence, and,
besides various temporal penalties, incurred a hundred unhappy rebirths in
the afterworld. In serious criminal cases evidence might be accepted from
all sources, but in civil law only certain witnesses were qualified; generally
women, learned brahmans, government servants, minors, debtors, persons
with criminal records, and persons suffering from physical defects could not
be called on to give evidence, while the evidence of low-caste people was
not valid against persons [Page 117] of higher caste. Several tests, some
very sound psychologically, are laid down to assess the veracity of
witnesses.

Where the accused was open to grave suspicion not amounting to
certainty he might be tortured to elicit confession. The tortures enumerated
for this purpose are not all of the most extreme type, and include various
forms of whipping. Brahmans, children, the aged, the sick, lunatics and
pregnant women were theoretically exempt from torture, while only light
torture was prescribed for women.

Another means of ascertaining guilt was the ordeal, which could be used
in both civil and criminal cases, and in certain forms is still sometimes
resorted to in India to settle disputes out of court. Ordeal is but little
mentioned in early texts, but seems to have grown more popular in later
times. The Smrti writers apparently distrusted ordeals, and generally limited
their application to cases in which there was no concrete evidence on either
side. Several ordeals are mentioned, however, including ordeals by fire and
immersion similar to those known in medieval Europe, and possibly having
a common Indo-European origin in the remote past. Specially interesting is
the ordeal of the ploughshare, in which the accused man had to touch a red-
hot iron ploughshare with his tongue; if it was not burned he was deemed
innocent-psychologically a fairly sound test of his own confidence in the
result, since if he had a guilty conscience his salivary glands would not
function properly, and his tongue would be burnt.

Megasthenes remarked that the Indian was not inclined to litigation, and
he may have been correct, though the same could not be said of India of
more recent times. In any case, though there were many brāhmans learned
in law they never constituted a class of professional pleaders, and those who
did not serve on the bench presumably used their knowledge to settle cases
out of court. There is evidence, however, that by the end of our period a
class of lawyers, in the modern sense, was beginning to develop, for some
late textbooks allow litigants to employ proxies, who are to be rewarded
with a share of the money involved, while one source grants to any learned
brahman the right to give his views on a case from the body of the court. 45


PUNISHMENT
The penalties imposed for criminal offences developed from two very
ancient customs, the wergeld and the religious penance imposed for ritual
offences. The influence of both can be clearly traced in the system of
punishment followed in later times.

[Page 118] The early Sūtras laid down fines for the punishment of
murder 1,000 cows for killing a ksatriya, 100 for a vaiśya, and 10 for a
śūdra or a woman of any class; the killing of a brāhman could not be
expiated by a fine. The cattle were handed to the king, who passed them on
to the relatives of the slain man, a bull being added as the king’s perquisite.

Later sources lose sight of the true nature of the fines as means of buying
off the vengeance of the family of the dead man, and lay down that the
cattle are expiatory gifts, to be given to the brāhmans. But the wergeld left
its mark on the legal system in the form of the fines, which, with or without
other punishment, are a special feature of ancient Indian justice. Fines
ranging from a small copper coin to the confiscation of all property were
levied, and could atone for all but the most serious crime. They were an
appreciable source of income to the state, and many medieval charters,
giving revenue rights over a village or district, specifically include the right
to receive the fines levied at the local court. A condemned person who
could not pay his fine was reduced to bondage until it was paid by his
labour.

The Smrti writers rarely mention imprisonment, but all other sources
show that it was common. Aśoka was proud of the many gaol-deliveries
which he had ordered in the course ofhis reign; according to a later tradition
he is said to have maintained in his unreformed early years a prison in
which the most fiendish tortures were inflicted, and from which no prisoner
came out alive.46 Hsüan Tsang mentions imprisonment as the usual form of
punishment under Harsa. Forced labour in the state mines and elsewhere is
mentioned as a punishment in the ArthasJstra, and no doubt amounted to
imprisonment of a very severe type. Mutilation and torture were common
penalties for many crimes, and numerous forms are described by legal
writers. Such punishments were often looked on rather as penances, and the
idea of religious penance was never completely absent from the thought of
the pious authors of the Smrtis, in considering the punishment of crime. It
was generally believed that by undergoing punishment in this life the
criminal escaped the evil consequences of his crime in the next.

The death penalty is laid down in many forms and for many crimes.

Unlike the early Sūras the Arthaśāstra prescribes it for murder, even as a
result of a duel or quarrel, if the injured man dies within seven days.

Hanging is the penalty for spreading false rumours, housebreaking, and
stealing the king’s elephants and horses. Those who plot against the king,
force entry into the king’s harem, aid his enemies, create disaffection in the
army, murder father, mother, son, brother or an ascetic, or commit serious
arson, are to be burnt alive. Beheading is the penalty laid down by the
Arthaśāstra for [Page 119] wilful murder or stealing a herd of cattle. The
man who deliberately breaks a dam is to be drowned in the same dam.

Women murdering their husbands or children, killing others by poison, or
committing arson are to be torn apart by oxen. Civilians stealing military
supplies are to be shot to death with arrows. These are some of the many
forms of execution suggested by the Arthaśāstra. This text is comparatively
lenient towards sexual crime, but Manu also prescribes death in various
unpleasant forms for most types of adultery and sexual assault. Even the
benevolent Asoka, for all his distaste for the taking of life, did not abolish
the death penalty (p. 55). The usual form of execution, little mentioned in
the textbooks on law, but often referred to in general literature, was
impalement.

Nevertheless it is evident that some opinion definitely opposed the death
penalty, and the question is considered from both sides in a remarkable
passage in the Mahābhārata. 47 Here the argument against capital
punishment and heavy penalties in general is not based, as might be
expected, on the doctrine of non-violence, which in no way forbade either
capital punishment or war, but rests wholly on humanitarian considerations.

In most cases mutilation, long imprisonment and execution result in untold
suffering for many innocent people, especially for the wife and family of
the criminal. The argument is quickly refuted-in this dark age the innocent


must suffer with the guilty, in order that society may be protected, anarchy
avoided, and men enabled to pursue the Sacred Law in peace.

Humanitarian ideas, probably encouraged by Buddhism, were effective in
Gupta times in moderating the fierce punishment of earlier days. Fa-hsien
records that the death penalty was not imposed in Northern India, but most
crime punished by fines, and only serious revolt by the amputation of one
hand. The Chinese traveller may have exaggerated, but his testimony at
least suggests that executions were rare. Hsüan Tsang 200 years later,
reported that prisoners were not executed under Har a, but were left to rot
in dungeons. In later times there is good evidence that capital punishment
was inflicted, and criminals often became the victims of human sacrifice,
but in the medieval period we read of sentences which, even by modern
standards, seem surprisingly mild. Thus a Cō a inscription records the gift
of 96 sheep to endow a perpetual lamp in a temple, the donor being a man
who had stabbed an army officer to death; this was apparently the only
penalty he suffered. Other South Indian instances can be found of murderers
being let off with comparatively small penances of this nature. It would
seem that here the blood feud had by no means disappeared, and if a
murderer could appease the enmity of his victim’s family the court would
let him off lightly. [Page 120] Killing in self-defence was justified in law, as
was the stealing of small quantities of food to stave off starvation.

In later times the lives of many animals were protected by law, especially
that of the cow. The story of the Cō a king who ordered the execution of his
own son for the accidental killing of a calf is certainly a legend, and we
need not believe that Kumārapāla (c. 1143–1172), the Jaina king of the
Caulukya dynasty of Gujarāt, so strictly enforced non-violence that heavy
fines were inflicted on people who killed fleas, but these stories show the
climate of opinion in medieval India. The wanton killing of a cow, in the
later period, was among the most serious of crimes.

The legal system envisaged by the Smrtis would impose graduated
punishment according to class. Thus a brāhman slandering a ksatriya
should, according to Manu, pay a fine of fifty panas, but for slandering a
vaiśya or a śūdra the fines are only twenty-five and twelve pa as
respectively. For members of the lower orders who slander their betters the
penalties are much more severe. Similar gradations of penalty according to
the class of the offender are laid down for many crimes, and the equality of


all before the law was never admitted in ancient India, and was quite
contrary to most Indian thought. If the samatā, which Aśoka instructed his
officials to employ in their judicial dealings,48 means equality the case is
unique; it is probable that the word implies no more than consistency, or
perhaps mildness. It is hardly likely that even Aśoka was bold enough to
introduce so drastic a change in the administration of justice-one which no
other ancient lawgiver, Indian or otherwise, would have agreed to.

In the later Vedic period some brāhmans claimed to be above the law
altogether. At the proclamation of the king at the end of the royal
consecration ceremony the chief officiating brahman turned to the
assembled multitude and cried “Here is your king, 0 Kurus-for us, our king
is [the god] Soma”. At all times the priestly class claimed many privileges
in law. According to most orthodox sources the brāhmans were exempt
from execution, torture, and corporal punishment, the worst penalty that
could be imposed on them being the humiliation of losing their topknot (p.

160), followed by confiscation of property and banishment. But the Sm ti
of Kātyāyana allows the execution of a brāhman for procuring abortion, the
murder of a respectable woman, and the theft of gold, while the Arthaśāstra
admits it for sedition, and also sanctions the branding of brahmans. In “The
Little Clay Cart” the hero, though a brāhman, is threatened with torture and
sentenced to death, and there is much other evidence that the brāhmans did
not always obtain the privileges which they claimed.

[Page 121] In fairness to the Hindu legal system, we must note that it did
not always work in favour of the brāhma . Manu lays down that as the
penalty for theft the śūdra should pay a fine equal to eight times the value of
the stolen goods, while the vaiśya, ksatriya and brāhman should pay
sixteen, thirty-two, and sixty-four times the value respectively. The upper
classes were expected to follow higher standards of conduct than the lower,
and their thefts were correspondingly more heinous.

As well as the royal courts there were other tribunals which could
arbitrate disputes and deal with minor crime. These were the councils of
villages, castes and guilds, whose validity as judicial bodies for their
members was fully recognized in the legal literature. They could punish
offenders by fines and excommunication, the latter a very serious penalty
indeed, and they probably played as important a part in the life of the
community as did the king’s courts. Unfortunately we have little knowledge
of their procedure.



THE SECRET SERVICE
Perhaps the least pleasant feature of political life in ancient India was the
espionage system. The most detailed picture of the working of this secret
service is given in the Arthaśāstra, the author of which devotes two
chapters to its organization, and refers to it throughout his treatise. The text
visualizes a country riddled from top to bottom with secret agents or spies.

They were organized through “institutes of espionage” to which they
delivered information, sometimes in cipher, and from which they received
their orders. These institutes were not responsible for the whole
organization of espionage, however, for there were special spies, directly
subordinate to the king or a high minister, and employed to spy on the
ministers themselves.

The spies might be recruited from any walk of life, and might be of either
sex. Brāhmans unable to make a living by their learning, merchants fallen
on evil days, barbers, astrologers, humble servitors, prostitutes, peasants-all
might be enrolled as secret agents. A special class of spy was the satr, an
orphan trained from childhood for the work, and usually masquerading as a
holy-man or a fortuneteller, two professions the members of which were
specially trusted by the public and might gain access to information which
others might find difficulty in obtaining. A further class was that of the
desperado, recruited from professional prize-fighters, whose main duty was
the assassination of those enemies of the king for whom a public trial was
not expedient, but who also performed other secret deeds of daring and
violence on behalf of his master.

[Page 122] The ancient Indian secret service has incurred much criticism,
some of which is not wholly fair. Probably no government at any time has
been able to function without secret agents of some sort, if only honest
detectives for the suppression of crime, and every ancient civilization had
its spies, though perhaps not so thoroughly organized as in the system of the
Arthaśāstra. The ancient Indian spy system was not quite comparable to the
secret political police of some modern states, since its function was by no
means confined to the suppression of criticism and sedition, and it was
looked on not as a mere macchiavellian instrument for maintaining power,
but as an integral part of the state machinery.

Certainly one of the spy’s chief duties was protecting the king’s power.

He sought out sedition, whether in the brothel or in the palace of the crown-
prince. He served as agent provocateur, to test the loyalty of high ministers,
generals, and judges. In the territory of enemies, whether potential or actual,
he not only obtained information on the strength and plans of the enemy but
encouraged sedition, and plotted the assassination of the enemy king and
his ministers. He also acted as a detective for the suppression of crime. For
this purpose he frequented taverns, brothels and gambling dens in disguise,
listened to the conversation of men in their cups, and carefully watched
those who seemed abnormally affluent.

But he had also other duties of a more positive character. He was an
important means of keeping a finger on the pulse of public opinion. In the
story of Rama (p. 412f) it is a spy who informs the king that his subjects
suspect Sītā’s chastity. The secret service, in fact, kept the king in touch
with his people. It was also a means of maintaining the king’s popularity.

One of the spy’s duties was to spread stories favourable to the king, to
praise him in public, and to argue with those who criticized the
administration. There is no reason to believe that mild criticism of the king
or his administration was normally punished. The ancient Indian secret
service might no doubt, in the hands of an unjust king, be a very evil thing,
but under a just administration it had positive and useful functions, and was
not a mere instrument of repression.



HINDU MILITARISM
The rule of law in personal, family and class relations was a fundamental
element of ancient Indian thought, but in the sphere of international affairs
there was no real conception of its possibility. A few enlightened people
recognized the evil effects of the warfare which afflicted the Indian sub-
continent during most of its history, but [Page 123] their message was
generally unheard. Aśoka was possibly the only ancient Indian king who
finally broke with the tradition of aggression, though his spirit can perhaps
be heard in certain passages in Buddhist texts, and many ordinary people
must have echoed his sentiments. Nevertheless, positive condemnations of
war are rare in Indian literature.

In one story the Buddha himself is depicted as intervening in a tribal war
between the Śakyas and their neighbours the Koliyas, and persuading the
contestants to come to terms. In the beautiful Dhammapada, an early
collection of Buddhist verse, we read:
Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered sleep in sorrow; above victory
or defeat the calm man dwells in peace.49
Buddhism was specially popular with the mercantile classes, who stood to
lose much from constant warfare, and the passing and rare references to the
evils of war in Buddhist texts may in part represent the mild protest of the
vaiśyas against the continual campaigning which interfered with their
trading ventures. In any case war was generally accepted as a normal
activity of the state, even by Buddhist kings. The doctrine of non-violence,
which in medieval India had become very influential, and had made most of
the respectable classes vegetarian, was never at this time taken to forbid war
or capital punishment. It was only in modern times that Mahātmā Gāndhī
reinterpreted it in this sense.

The intense militarism of ancient India did not lead to the building of a
permanent empire over the whole sub-continent. In this respect the early
history of India contrasts strikingly with that of China, where, from the 3rd
century B.C., a single empire was the rule, and division the exception. In

India the Mauryas succeeded in creating a unified empire for a century, and
in the heyday of the Guptas much of North India was under one hand, but
with these exceptions numerous factors prevented the unification of the
recognized cultural unit of Bhāratavar a, which so many ambitious
monarchs desired.

One of these factors was the mere size of the land, but the Chinese
emperors conquered equal difficulties. Another reason for the failure of
Indian empire builders was that, for all the wise counsel of the Arthasastra,
no king of India was able to develop a bureaucracy capable of functioning
without a strong guiding hand; in China the examination system and the
ethics of Confucius ensured that those in charge of affairs would usually be
men of character and intellect, [Page 124] if rather pedantic and
conservative. But the main factor which prevented the unification of India
was the martial tradition itself.

For the post-Mauryan king the idea of empire was something very
different from that to which the West is accustomed. According to the
Arthaśāstra there are three types of conquest: righteous conquest, conquest
for greed, and demoniac conquest. * The first is conquest in which the
defeated king is forced to render homage and tribute, after which he or a
member of his family is reinstated as a vassal. The second is victory in
which enormous booty is demanded and large portions of enemy territory
annexed. The third involves the political annihilation of the conquered
kingdom and its incorporation in that of the victor. The two latter types are
generally disapproved of by all sources except the Arthaśāstra. Thus the
Mahābhārata declares:
“A king should not attempt to gain the earth unrighteously, for who
reveres the king who wins unrighteous victory? Unrighteous conquest
is impermanent, and does not lead to heaven.” 50
The idea of “righteous conquest” or “conquest according to the the
Sacred Law” may have developed among the Āryans soon after their
occupation of North India, as an expression of their solidarity against the
dark-skinned natives. It is evident, though not explicitly stated, in later
Vedic literature. The kings of Magadha, from Bimbisāra onwards, ignored
it, and annexed territory without compunction; but the doctrine that war
should be waged for glory and homage rather than sordid aims such as
wealth and power grew in importance with the fall of the Mauryas, and was
accepted by the medieval quasi-feudal order. “Demoniac conquest” still
took place from time to time, notably under the Guptas, but “righteous
conquest” was the ideal which Hindu kings were expected to follow, and it
is evident that they usually did. War became the sport of kingsa sport which
was often very profitable and always very serious, in which the shame of
defeat might well only be expunged by suicide, but a sport nevertheless.

The Peninsula, inheriting a fierce Dravidian tradition never completely
submerged by Āryan influence, had a more realistic approach; here
conquest with annexation was more common, as well as ruthlessness
towards captives and non-combatants, but even the South was not
unaffected by the ideal of the “righteous conquest”.

PLATE XXX
[Page 125] In most of the texts on statecraft we read of the “six
instruments of policy” ( ādgu ya): peace, war, waiting for the enemy to
strike the first blow, attack, alliance, and “double policy” or making peace
with one enemy and continuing war with another. * The list is a stock one,
and gives a further example of the delight of the Indian theorist in pedantic
classification, but it is nevertheless significant. Peace is only one of the six
categories; the others are aspects of war in all its branches. The Arthaśāstra
quotes an earlier authority, Vātavyādhi, as disagreeing with the sixfold
classification, and maintaining that statecraft involved only two aspects,
peace and war.51 Of this view the text strongly disapproves; pacific
relations are straightforward and obvious, while war is complex and highly
developed. It is significant that one of the words commonly used for enemy,
para, has the simple primary meaning of “other”.

At all times conquest was the chief ambition of the Indian king. Even
Aśoka, who abjured aggressive war, did not give up the hope of conquest
(p. 54). The position is succinctly put by the Arthaśāstra: “The king who is
weaker than ‘the other’ should keep the peace; he who is stronger should
make war.” 52 The same aphorism is repeated in many other sources, in
slightly varying forms, but a difference of attitude is apparent as we leave
the Mauryan recollections of the Arthaśāstra for the later texts, the outlook
of which reflects memories of the later Vedic age, adapted to the often
anarchic conditions of the period between the Mauryas and Guptas.

For the earlier source war is a “continuation of policy by other means”.

Its purpose is not glory, but wealth and power, and the passage we have
quoted, defining the three types of conquest, is, we believe, either a sop to
conventional doctrine or a later interpolation, for it is inconsistent with the
tenor of the book. The whole work is written for a king who aspires to
become an emperor on the Mauryan model, and such a king is not advised
to embark on war lightly. There are many other ways of gaining power,
intrigue and assassination among them, and these should always be resorted
to in preference to war, which should only be looked on as a last resort. If a
king suffers decisive defeat he must submit, in the hope that he will be
allowed to retain his throne as a vassal and ultimately again achieve
independence and conquer his former overlord. The Arthaśāstra says
nothing about fair play in battle, and evidently looks on conquest of the
demoniac variety as the most profitable and advisable. Though in one
passage, not in keeping with the main tenor of the work, it suggests
allowing the conquered king to remain as a vassal, it ends on a note [Page
126] of humanitarian imperialism. The victor must do everything in his
power to conciliate the conquered people; if their economy has suffered
badly from the war, taxes must be remitted; ministers of the defeated king
must be won round, and law and order restored as quickly as possible; when
in the conquered country the king should wear local dress and follow local
customs. Evidently, from the point of view of the Arthaśāstra, the main
motive of war is gain and the building up of a great empire.

The more orthodox texts, however, take a different point of view. Here
the major motive of war is glory, not gain. War is not merely a means to an
end, but part of the warrior’s dharma, and good for its own sake. As soon as
a king has established himself on the throne he should, as a matter of
course, attack his neighbours. Rules of fair fighting are laid down, which
are not heard of in the Arthaśāstra. For the later sources, such as Manu, a
battle was ideally a gigantic tournament with many rules: a warrior fighting
from a chariot might not strike one on foot; an enemy in flight, wounded or
asking quarter might not be slain; the lives of enemy soldiers who had lost
their weapons were to be respected; poisoned weapons were not to be used.

Homage and not annexation was the rightful fruit of victory.

These rules were not always kept. The heroes of the Mahābhārata
infringe them many times, even at the behest of their mentor Krsna, and the
infringements are explained and pardoned by recourse to casuistical
arguments of expediency and necessity. The rules of war could only be
maintained strictly by a king certain of victory or certain of defeat. Where
chances were narrow the claims of selfpreservation inevitably made
themselves felt. But the chivalrous rules of warfare, probably based on very
old tradition, and codified in their present form among the martial peoples
of Western India in post-Mauryan times, must have had some effect in
mitigating the harshness of war for combatant and non-combatant alike. It
is doubtful if any other ancient civilization set such humane ideals of
warfare.

Together with these rules, the later texts introduce the conception of
military honour, which is not found in the realistic Arthaśāstra, except in
the form of propaganda to maintain the morale of the troops. Flight is the
deepest of shames; the soldier slain in flight incurs the guilt of his lord, and
suffers proportionately in the after-life, but the soldier slain while fighting
to the last passes straight to heaven. Such ideals culminated in the jauhar,
the final holocaust which was the fate of many a medieval Rājput king, with
his family and bodyguard, the women and children burning alive in the
inner chambers of the fort while the men fought to the last on the
battlements.



[Page 127] The live dog was no longer thought to be better than the dead
lion, in so far as the spirit of the Epics permeated Hindu life. But the
Arthaśāstra was not wholly forgotten, and not every king of medieval India
was willing to sacrifice himself and his family when defeat stared him in
the face. As well as kings who resisted the Muslim invaders to the last there
were many who tried to buy them off, and who retained diminished
kingdoms under the suzerainty of the hated Mleccha.

In this political climate it is not surprising that inter-state relations were
of the most macchiavellian character. The basic concept which governed the
relations of one king with another was the doctrine of the “circles” ( ma
ala), which, like many other concepts, was pedantically elaborated by the
theorists on statecraft. The king on whose territory the circle is centred is
known as “he who desires conquest” ( vijig u). The king whose territory
adjoins that of the would-be conqueror is “the enemy” ( ari)—“when he is
in trouble he must be attacked, when he has little or no help he may be
uprooted, otherwise he must be harassed and weakened”. 53 Beyond the
enemy lies “the friend” ( mitra) the natural ally of the conqueror. So far the
system of circles is simple and obvious, but the theorists enlarged it further.

Beyond the friend is “the enemy’s friend” ( arimitra), and beyond him “the
friend’s friend” ( mitramitra). The opposite frontier of the conqueror’s
kingdom provides a further series of potential foes and allies, the
“heelsiezer” ( pār graha), who is an ally of the conqueror’s enemy and is
liable to attack him in the rear, the “defender” or rearward friend ( ākranda),
the heelsiezer’s ally ( pār grāhisāra), and the rearward friend’s friend
( ākrandāsāra). The main purport of this enumeration is clear-a king’s
neighbour is his natural enemy, while the king beyond his neighbour is his
natural ally. The working of this principle can be seen throughout the
history of Hindu India in the temporary alliances of two kingdoms to
accomplish the encirclement and destruction of the kingdoms between
them.

In such conditions diplomatic relations were not thoroughly organized,
and there is no evidence of a system of permanent ambassadors. Relations
between one court and another were maintained by envoys ( dūta), who
resided at the court to which they were sent only while transacting the
business in hand. As in most civilizations, the person of the envoy was
inviolable, and a king slaying an envoy was thought to be reborn in hell
with all his councillors.

Megasthenes states that peasants would till their fields peacefully, even
when a battle was raging nearby, but this is probably too optimistic a
generalization. Devastation of the crops to weaken the [Page 128] enemy
was quite legitimate according to the textbooks, and, although there was a
strong feeling that the lives of non-combatants should be respected, this rule
was not always kept. In any case, except in favoured times and localities the
peasant could never feel wholly safe from raiders, and, though the
wholesale sacking of cities was not common in ancient India, the townsman
could rarely feel altogether secure against the looting and exactions of
enemy occupation. Conditions in Hindu India were not unlike those in
medieval Europe, where there was a broad and recognized cultural unity
accompanied by inter-state anarchy resulting in perpetual warfare. In
Europe, however, the well-organized. and centralized Roman Church often
acted as a pacifying element in the situation; in India Hinduism, which had
no all-embracing super-national organization, rather encouraged inter-state
anarchy by incorporating many martial traditions into the Sacred Law.



MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND TECHNIQUE
The ancient Indian army contained more than one type of soldier, and
troops are sometimes classified into six categories: hereditary troops,
forming the backbone of the army; mercenaries; troops provided by
corporations ( śreni); troops supplied by subordinate allies; deserters from
the enemy; and wild tribesmen, used for guerilla fighting in hill and jungle.

Of this list the third category is obscure, but it perhaps refers to the private
armies, maintained by merchant guilds for the protection of their caravans
and trading posts, which might be loaned to the king. In medieval Ceylon
the corporation of Malabar merchants called Ma igrāma (p. 223), like the
Honourable Company in 18th century India, became an important and often
a decisive factor in the island’s politics through its private army. The fierce
mercenaries of Kerala (Malabār) and Karnāta (Mysore) found ready
employment in the armies of many Indian and Sinhalese kings throughout
the Middle Ages.

Of the four great classes the ksatriya was the warrior par excellence, and
no doubt most of the hereditary troops considered themselves to belong to
this class, but all classes took part in war. Brāhmans holding high military
rank are mentioned in the Epics and in many medieval inscriptions, and
their participation in war is expressly permitted in some texts. The lower
orders fought also, usually as auxiliaries or subordinates, but the late
textbook on polity ascribed to Śukra lays down that the highest military
posts, even to that of general, may be filled by śūdras or outcastes.54
In the early Vedic period all free men were no doubt liable to [Page 129]
military service by tribal custom, but, with the strengthening of caste ideas,
the liability vanished in most parts of India. There is no evidence of general
conscription in any major Indian kingdom from the Mauryas onwards,
though the Arthaśāstra mentions villages which provided troops in lieu of
taxes, and such villages of warriors existed in the quasi-feudal Middle
Ages; the martial character of the tribes of N.-W. India, Rājasthān, and parts
of the Western Deccan, seems to have altered little from the earliest times,

despite numerous invasions and changes of overlord, and survives to the
present day; among such people most able-bodied men took part in war.

The traditional divisions of the Indian army were four: elephants, cavalry,
chariots, and infantry; some sources add other categories, such as navy,
spies, pioneers, and commissariat, to bring the total up to six or eīght. Of
these elements the most important, from the point of view of contemporary
theory, was the first.

Elephants trained for war are first mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures,
where it is said that king Bimbisara of Magadha owned a large and efficient
elephant corps. They were trained with great care and attention, and,
marching in the van of the army, acted rather like tanks in modern warfare,
breaking up the enemy’s ranks and smashing palisades, gates, and other
defences (p. 457f); a line of elephants might also act as a living bridge for
crossing shallow rivers and streams. Elephants were often protected by
leather armour, and their tusks tipped with metal spikes. The Chinese
traveller Sung Yiin, who visited the kingdom of the Hū as in the early 6th
century, speaks of fighting elephants with swords fastened to their trunks,
with which they wrought great carnage, but there is no confirmation of this
practice in other sources. As well as the mahout the elephant usually carried
two or three soldiers, armed with bows, javelins and long spears, and
advanced with a small detachment of infantry to defend it from attack.

The great reliance placed on elephants by Indian tacticians was, from the
practical point of view, unfortunate. Though fighting elephants might at
first strike great terror in an invading army unused to them, they were by no
means invincible. Just as the Romans found means of defeating the
elephants of Pyrrhus and Hannibal, so Greeks, Turks, and other invaders
soon lost their fear of the Indian fighting elephant. Even the best trained
elephant was demoralized comparatively easily, especially by fire, and
when overcome by panic would infect its fellows, until a whole squadron of
elephants, trumpeting in terror, would turn from the battle, throw the riders,
and trample the troops of its own side. The pathetic Indian faith in the
elephants’ fighting qualities was inherited by the Muslim conquerors, who,
after [Page 130] a few generations in India, became almost as reliant on
elephants as the Hindus, and suffered at the hands of armies without
elephants in just the same way.


Cavalry, though important, was not up to the standard of that of many
other early peoples, and the weakness of their cavalry was an important
factor in the defeat of Indian armies attacked by invaders from the North-
West; the decisive victory of Alexander over Porus in 326 B.C. and that of
Muhammad of Ghor over Prthvīrāja in A.D. 1192 were both largely due to
superior, more mobile, cavalry. Mounted archers were a special danger to
Indian armies.

The chariot as a vehicle of war disappeared soon after the
commencement of the Christian era. In the Vedic period it was the major
fighting arm, and it retained this importance in the Epic stories. The
Arthaśāstra and other evidence shows that in Mauryan times it was still
widely used in war, and early sculpture depicts a few fighting chariots; but
by Gupta times the chariot was little more than a means of transport. The
light two-horsed chariot of the Vedic period, carrying only a driver and a
warrior, developed into a larger and more cumbrous vehicle. Four-horsed
chariots are mentioned by classical sources, and are depicted at Sānchī and
elsewhere, with horses yoked abreast, and carrying four men.

There are several references to ships being used for military purposes,
but little evidence that Indian kings had a real conception of the value of
sea-power, or naval warfare. Ships were chiefly used for conveying troops,
usually along the great Indian rivers; but the [Page 131] Cālukya king
Pulakeśin II employed a navy to besiege Purī, not far from the modern


Bombay (p. 511, n), and the two great Cō a kings, Rājarāja I and Rājendra I
(p. 75), developed a positive maritime policy and evidently had a regular
navy. The Sinhalese conqueror Parākramabāhu I (p. 75) is said to have
invaded Burma by sea. Ships of war were used to put down the many
pirates who infested the Indian Ocean, and Arab writers of the Middle Ages
show that the petty chiefs of the West Coast themselves organized pirate
fleets; but, with the exception of the Cō as, it is doubtful if any Indian king
possessed a navy in the modern sense.

The infantry, though little mentioned in the texts, must at all times have
been the real backbone of the army. An élite corps, a sort of Pretorian
Guard, existed in most kingdoms. In the medieval South this royal guard
was pledged to defend the king’s person to the death, and its loyalty was
confirmed by a ceremonial meal eaten with the king on his accession. The
privilege of eating with the king conferred on the guardsmen a sort of
nobility, and they are mentioned by Marco Polo as “Companions of
Honour”.

The Arthaśāstra envisages a corps of physicians to care for the wounded,
ready in the rear with drugs, bandages, and other equipment. The existence
of such a corps, and of a staff of horse and elephant doctors attached to the
army, is confirmed by other sources. The same text mentions the
employment of women to cook for the troops in the rear of the battle.

According to most theorists the basic unit of the Indian army was the
patti, a sort of mixed platoon consisting of one elephant, one chariot, three
horses, and five foot-soldiers. Three of these constituted a senāmukha, three
senamukhas a gulma, and so on up to the “complete army” ( ak auhiznī), of
21,870 pattis. The exaggerated precision of this list is another example of
the pedantry which beset most ancient Indian writing on practical matters,
and there is no good evidence that the army was regularly divided in this
way, with all arms intermixed. Other sources speak of commands rising in
units of ten, and the Arthaśāstra mentions a unit consisting of 45 chariots,
45 elephants, 225 horses, and 675 footmen; five of these detachments
formed a full battle array ( samavyūha), resembling the Roman legion in
size. The Arthaśāstra allows wide variation in these numbers according to
the availability of resources and the requirements of the situation.

The Indian army was usually a very large one. Classical accounts state
that the forces of the last Nanda king consisted of 20,000 cavalry, 2,000


chariots, 200,000 footmen, and a number of elephants variously given as
3,000, 4,000, or 6,000. Plutarch records that [Page 132] Candragupta
Maurya overran India with 600,000 men. Hsüan Tsang states that Harsa had
5,000 elephants, 20,000 cavalry, and 50,000 footmen at the beginning of his
career, which were increased to 60,000 elephants and 100,000 cavalry at the
height of his power. The 9th-century Arab traveller Al Mas’ūdī says that the
Pratihara king Mahendrapala had four armies of 800,000 men each, while
the Cō a king Rajaraja I is said to have invaded the kingdom of the
Calukyas with an army of 900,000. All this evidence is far from reliable,
but it is noteworthy that estimates of the size of medieval armies are
considerably larger than those of armies of the earlier period, and this may
bear some relation to fact. Fully mobilized, and including auxiliaries and
non-combatants, it is not impossible that the total fighting force of a larger
medieval kingdom numbered well over a million.

According to Megasthenes the Mauryan army was organized under a
committee of thirty, divided into sub-committees which controlled the corps
of infantry, cavalry, chariots, elephants, navy, and commissariat. This
system seems to be modelled on Megasthenes’ description of the city
government of Pātaliputra (p. 103), and is not confirmed by any other
source. The Arthaśāstra describes the army as organized under a number of
superintendents, with a general ( senāpati) at the head of all military affairs.

Medieval armies often had numerous generals, with a “great general”
( mahāsenāpati) in supreme command. The general was always a very
important figure in the realm, and often a member of the royal family. He
took orders direct from the king, who was expected to take command in
major engagements, even when aged. Kings often fought in the van of the
battle, but the cautious Arthaśāstra advises them to direct operations from
the rear. Below the general were numerous captains ( nāyaka, da
anāyaka), who, in the medieval period, often approximated to a feudal
nobility. Regiments, divisions, and squadrons were recognized by
distinguishing standards, and often had a definite corporate life. In medieval
South India we hear of the troops of a regiment subscribing to a fund for the
dependants of a comrade killed in battle, and there are records of religious
donations made by regimental subscription.

The arms of ancient India were not appreciably different from those of
other early civilizations. Efforts have been made by some scholars, not all

of them Indian, to show that firearms and even flying machines were
known, but this is certainly not the case. The one clear reference to firearms
occurs in Śukra, which is late medieval, and the passage in question is
probably an interpolation of Mughal times. The mysterious and magical
weapons of the Epics, slaying hundreds at a blow and dealing fire and death
all around them, must be the products of the poet’s imagination. If India had
had firearms her Greek, Chinese and Arab visitors would certainly have
recorded the existence of such wonders, and also, a fortiori, of the
marvellous aerial pavilions described in the Rāmāyana, early Tamil texts,
and elsewhere, the making of which was quite beyond the technical ability
of any ancient civilization.

PLATE XXXII
[Page 133] In fact the Indians possessed the ancient world’s equipment of
artillery-ballistas (not known before Mauryan times), battering rams and


other siege engines. The inspiration for the wonderful weapons of the poets
may have come from the incendiary missiles, fireballs, fire-arrows and the
like, which were a special feature of Indian military equipment, though
disapproved of as unfair by the Smrti writers. The Arthaśāstra especially
stresses the value of incendiarism in war, and even suggests the use of birds
and monkeys to carry fire to the enemy’s rooftops. It gives brief formulae
for the composition of inflammable material, which are clear enough to
show that this was not gunpowder.

The usual Indian bow in Mauryan times was some five or six feet long,
and often made of bamboo; it shot long cane arrows. According to classical
accounts it was a very powerful instrument, which was rested on the ground
and steadied with one foot, but the bows of the few archers shown in early
sculpture are raised from the ground. Poisoned arrows were known and
used, though condemned in religious texts. The less cumbersome composite
bow, often made of horn ( śar iga), was also known, and became more
popular in later times. Swords were of various types, the most dangerous
being the ni rimśa, a long two-handed slashing sword. Lances and javelins
were among the usual equipment of the Indian soldier, including a special
long lance ( tomara) used in fighting from the backs of elephants. Iron
maces and battle-axes were also used. Terracotta slingstones have been
found in the remains of the Indus cities, and the sling was used in later
times, though it does not seem to have been an important weapon.

The warriors depicted in early sculpture (pl. XXIV) are only lightly
defended with armour, but the use of armour of metal or leather developed
as a result of the influx of invaders from the NorthWest, and in the Middle
Ages coats of mail became more usual, together with armour for horses and
elephants. Shields of bent cane covered with leather, or of metal, were
regularly used, sometimes protecting the whole body. Helmets are not often
depicted until the Middle Ages, and it would seem that the Indian soldier
relied mainly on the thick folds of his turban to protect his head.

[Page 134] Fortification was an important branch of military science, but
nearly all the fortresses of pre-Muslim India have been so developed and
adapted in later times that they no longer give a true picture of ancient
Indian military architecture. An important exception is the long wall of
rough-hewn stone protecting the site of the ancient Rajagrha, the capital of
Bimbisara of Magadha, which probably dates back to the Buddha’s day.



Another example is Śiśupālgarh in Orissā, where a small section of the city
wall dating from pre-Gupta times, has recently been excavated. It was a
workmanlike brick wall, set on an earthwork and probably surrounded by a
moat.

The ideal durga, or fortified city, as described in the Arthaśāstra, was
circled by three very wide moats, within which was an earthwork, covered
with spiny shrubs, and surmounted by a wall thirty-six feet high, with
numerous square towers and roofed balconies for archers. With this may be
compared Megasthenes’ description of the defences of Pataliputra, which is
said to have had a mighty wooden wall, with 570 towers and 64 gates. The
Arthaśāstra advises against the use of wood for fortifications, owing to its
liability to fire and rot, but archæology bears out Megasthenes, for the
remains of some of the gigantic timbers of the wall of Mauryan Pataliputra
have been excavated near the modern Patna. The defences of Śiśupalgarh
were certainly smaller and less elaborate (pl. XIa).


Fig. xi.—A Siege (from a relief at Sānchī, c. beginning of Christian era)
The most important surviving pre-Muslim fortress is Devagiri (modern
Daulātābad), the capital of the Yādava kings of the Northern Deccan until
its capture by the troops of Ala’-ud-din Khaljī in 1312. The outer
fortifications have mostly been replaced and developed by later Muslim
rulers, but the citadel, on an almost inaccessible hill, (pl. IIc), still contains
the corridors cut by the Hindu kings through the solid rock, which were
virtually the only means of reaching the summit, and are a memorial to the
engineering skill of medieval India.

In sieges the attackers relied mainly on close investment and the
reduction of their enemy by starvation and thirst, but capture by [Page 135]
storm was not unheard of, and mining was regularly employed. The word
for a mine or underground tunnel was sura ga, borrowed from the Greek


word, which had the same secondary meaning; from this we may infer that
the Indians learned something of siegecraft from the Greco-Bactrian kings.

The Indian army was slow and ponderous. The Arthaśāstra declares that
a good army can march two yojanas a day, while a bad army only march
one. The yojana, like the medieval English league, is an uncertain measure
of distance, varying from four to ten miles; but internal evidence shows that
the author of the Arthaśāstra had in mind a yojana of about five miles. Thus
a march of ten miles per day was the most that could be expected even of a
well-organized and efficient army. This is not surprising, when we read of
its complex and cumbrous organization.

The army dwelt in an enormous camp which was, in fact, a temporary
city, with royal quarters, quarters for the king’s harem, and for camp
followers, merchants and prostitutes. The king and his chief officers took
many members of their families with them on campaign, including a
representative selection of their wives and concubines, and probably the
lower ranks did likewise. The Rā rakuita king Amoghavarsa I (817–877)
was actually born in camp, while his father Govinda III was campaigning in
the Vindhyas. This large body of non-combatants not wholly subject to
army discipline must have appreciably slowed the pace of the army and
impaired its efficiency. One theorist disapproved of women in the camp,55
but it seems that his advice was rarely if ever followed.

The Arthaśāstra envisaged strict discipline in the camp; it was to be
thoroughly guarded and policed, and exit and entry were to be controlled by
a rigorous system of passes. In fact it was probably less well organized than
this source suggests, especially in later times, when the secret of detailed
organization, which the Mauryas possessed and the Arthaśāstra reflects,
was largely lost. Bāna’s vivid description of Harsa’s army striking camp (p.

448f) does not suggest a very efficient quartermaster’s department.

The Arthaśāstra gives much advice on the preliminaries of battle, but
unfortunately says little on the actual conduct of the fighting, for which we
must turn to the exaggerated accounts of the Epics and other sources.

Battle was a great religious rite, the highest sacrifice of the warrior, and
as such was not entered without proper preliminaries. The day and time of
giving battle were chosen with great care by astrologers, whenever this was
possible, and purificatory rites were performed on its eve. Before battle the

troops were harangued by brahmans, and [Page 136] by the king himself,
and were encouraged with promises of booty and glory, with the certainty
of heaven for the slain.

The Arthaśāstra advises the employment of heavy infantry in the centre,
with light infantry, chariots, and cavalry on the wings. The elephants were
generally concentrated in the centre, while the archers took up positions
behind the spearmen. Descriptions of battles are usually turgid, and overlaid
with fanciful and supernatural elements; but it is clear that at most times
great emphasis was placed on single combat between picked warriors.

Though the mass fighting of the rank and file must often have played a
decisive part in the encounter, it is given little notice in the literary sources
on which we must depend. For the ordinary soldier courage and morale
depended on the leader. Only the noble or the elite warrior could be relied
on to fight to the last, and there is more than one account of an army fleeing
in panic when its chief was killed or wounded.

The Arthaśāstra suggests that a price should be put on every enemy head,
varying according to rank from twenty pa as upwards; this would not
encourage the giving of quarter, but the massacre of prisoners was unusual,
and it was very strongly deprecated in the Smrti texts. Captives were
usually released on payment of ransom, and those who could not pay, and
these probably included most of the common soldiers, were enslaved; but
their enslavement was usually temporary, and they were released when they
had paid their ransom by their labour.

From these notes it will be seen that inter-state relations and war were the
weakest aspects of Indian polity. The kingdoms of medieval Hindu India,
incapable either of empire building or of firm alliances, and maintaining
enormous unwieldy armies which were continuously at war, indeed
produced their heroes, but they were quite incapable of withstanding the
Turks, whose military science was not overburdened by pedantic theory or
ancient tradition.

SOCIETY: CLASS, FAMILY AND INDIVIDUAL


LAWS OF CLASS AND STAGE OF LIFE
[Page 137]
OFTEN and in many contexts we read of “the Dharma of class and stage of
life” ( varnasrama-dharma), which, in the golden age of the remote past,
was self-evident and uninfringed, but which is now vague, misunderstood
and partly forgotten, and which the brahmans interpret and the king
preserves and enforces. The implication of this phrase is that Dharma is not
the same for all. There is indeed a common Dharma, a general norm of
conduct which all must follow equally, but there is also a dharma
appropriate to each class and to each stage in the life of the individual. The
dharma of men of high birth is not that of humbler folk, and the dharma of
the student is not that of the old man.

This thoroughgoing recognition that men are not the same, and that there
is a hierarchy of classes, each with its separate duties and distinctive way of
life, is one of the most striking features of ancient Indian sociology.

Criticisms of the pretensions of the higher classes were heard from time to
time, and equalitarian propositions were occasionally put forward, but in
general this concept has held its ground from the end of the Ṛg Vedic period
to the present day.



THE FOUR GREAT CLASSES
We have seen that by the end of the Ṛg Vedic period the fourfold division
of society was regarded as fundamental, primeval, and divinely ordained (p.

35). The four varnas of India developed out of very early Āryan class
divisions, for some class stratification existed in many Indo-European
communities, and ancient Iran had four pištras or classes, comparable in
some respects to those of India. In India class stratification grew more rigid
when, in the Vedic period, a situation arose rather like that prevailing in
South Africa today, with a dominant fair minority striving to maintain its
purity and its supremacy over a darker majority. Tribal class-divisions
hardened, and the dark-skinned aboriginal found a place only in the
basement of the Āryan social structure, as a serf with few rights and many
disabilities. Soon the idea of varna had become so deeply embedded in
[Page 138] the Indian mind that its terminology was even used for the
classification of precious commodities such as pearls, and useful materials
like timber. Theoretically all Aryans belonged to one of the four classes,
with the exception of children, ascetics and widows, who were outside the
system.

Varna came to the Dravidian South comparatively late, for the earliest
Tamil literature shows a society divided into tribal groups with little sense
of the precedence of one over the other. Succeeding centuries saw the
gradual hardening of class, until South Indian brahmans became even
stricter in their ritual observances and the untouchables even more debased
than in the North.

A sharp distinction was made between the three higher classes and the
śūdra. The former were twice-born (dvija), once at their natural birth and
again at their initiation, when they were invested with the sacred thread and
received into Āryan society1 (p. 161f). The śūdra had no initiation, and was
often not looked on as Āryan at all. The fourfold division was in theory
functional. Manu1 lays down that the duty of the brāhman is to study and
teach, to sacrifice, and to give and receive gifts; the ksatriya must protect
the people, sacrifice, and study; the vaisya also sacrifices and studies, but
his chief function is to breed cattle, to till the earth, to pursue trade and to
lend money; the sudra’s duty is only to serve the three higher classes-and “it
is better”, Manu adds elsewhere, 2 “to do one’s own duty badly than
another’s well”. This epigram, elaborated so beautifully in the Bhagavad
Gita, was the leading theme of most Indian social thought; for each man
there was a place in society and a function to fulfil, with its own duties and
rights.

This was the ideal, but though in the Middle Ages it was perhaps
approached, it has never been wholly reached. The precepts of the texts
which lay down the laws for the conduct of the four classes were rarely
fully carried out in practice, and were often blatantly infringed. The texts,
which we have already discussed (p. 1 l2f), were written by brāhmans and
from the brāhmanic point of view, and represent conditions as the brāhmans
would have liked them to be. Thus it is not surprising that they claim the
utmost honour for the priestly class and exalt it above measure.

The brāhman was a great divinity in human form. 3 His spiritual power
was such that he could instantly destroy the king and his army, if they
attempted to infringe his rights. In law he claimed great privileges (p. 120),
and in every respect he demanded precedence, honour and worship. Even
the Buddhist scriptures, though they do [Page 139] not admit the more
extravagant brahmanical claims and regularly exalt the kṣatriya over the
brahma0., recognize his greatness, if he is pious and sincere.

These Buddhist sources show us two types of brāhman. There were
learned brahmans, performing all the rites of the Āryan and receiving great
respect; but there were also village brahmans, who made much of their
living by fortune-telling and sorcery, and who were less honoured. For all
the rigidity of the class system the brahmans soon lost their racial purity,
and it has even been suggested that, as Āryan culture expanded, schools of
aboriginal sorcerers and medicine men managed to obtain a footing in the
brahmanic order, just as aboriginal chiefs were certainly assimilated to the
warrior class. Thus, it may well be, the proto-Hinduism of the Harappā
culture was ultimately assimilated to the Āryan faith.

Of professional priests there were various types and classes-in the earliest
times we read of the semi-legendary ṛṣ is, or seers, who composed the Vedic
hymns, while the sacrificial ritual demanded a number of priests (ṛ tvij) with
specialized duties-invokers ( hotr), cantors ( udgdtr), and priests to perform
the manual operations of the ceremony ( adhvaryu). The term brāhmaṇ a
meant originally “one possessed of brahman”, a mysterious magical force
of the type widely known to modern anthropologists by the Polynesian
word mana. It was first applied to the specially trained priest who
superintended the whole sacrifice, and was ready to counteract with his
magic spells any evil influence caused by minor errors of ritual. By the end
of the R.g Vedic period the term was used for all members of the priestly
class.

There were other divisions within the order. The brāhmans of the later
Vedic period were divided into exogamous septs ( gotra), a system which
was copied in part by other classes and has survived to the present day (p.

153ff). Later the brahman class formed many castes, linked together by
endogamy and common practices. A further division was the śākhā or
branch, based on the recension of the Vedic texts accepted as authoritative
by the family in question.

Often the brahman lived under the patronage of a king or chief, and was
provided for by grants of tax-free land, farmed by peasants, who would pay
their taxes to the brahman instead of to the king; but there were also land-
owning brahmans, who cultivated large estates by hired labour or serfs. The
religious brahman might have a high post at court, and the purohita’s2
importance in the state has [Page 140] already been noted (p. 100). Other
brāhmans might earn a competence as teachers of the Veda, and of other
branches of learning.

At all times many brāhmans led truly religious lives. Kalidasa’s
Sakuntala gives a charming picture of a settlement of such pious brahmans,
living simply but not too austerely in huts in the forest, where even the wild
deer were unafraid of the gentle hermits, and the woodland was forever
perfumed with the fragrance of their sacred fires. Such brahman colonies
were supported by the gifts of kings and chiefs and of the peasants of the
neighbourhood. Other brāhmans became solitary ascetics, while in the
Middle Ages brahman monastic orders were founded, rather on the
Buddhist model.

But the varied religious activity of ancient India did not provide a
livelihood for more than a few of the brahmans. The Smrti literature
contains special sections on “duty when in distress” (apad-dharma), which
carefully define what a man may legitimately do when he cannot earn a
living by the profession normally followed by his class, and by these
provisions brāhmans might pursue all manner of trades and professions.

Many were employed in important government posts, and several royal
families were of brāhman. origin. Generally the lawbooks disapprove of
brāhmans engaging in agriculture, because it inflicts injury on animals and
insects, but this rule was often ignored. A brahman is forbidden to trade in
certain commodities-among them cattle and other animals, slaves, weapons,
and spirituous liquor-and his lending money at interest is also disapproved
of, though Manu4 allows him to lend at low interest to “wicked people”, by
whom he probably means those who do not maintain Āryan rites. But
though he kept these rules rigidly, a brahman would find many trades and
professions open to him.

Opinions differed as to whether a brahman engaged in a secular
profession was worthy of the respect accorded to the practising member of
his class, and no clear ruling is laid down. Manu, the most authoritative of
the Smrtis, is uncertain on this point, and in different parts of the text
diametrically opposed views are given. 5 As far as can be gathered from
general literature the special rights of the brahman were usually only
granted to those who lived by sacrifice and teaching. Carudatta, the poor
brahman hero of the play “The Little Clay Cart” (p. 120), receives scurvy
treatment at the hands of the court, probably because he is a brahman by
birth only, and not by profession.

For all his prestige, the brahman was often the butt of satire. Even in the
Ṛ g Veda 6 the croaking of frogs at the beginning of the rainy season is
compared to the monotonous reciting of the priests, though here no sarcasm
may be intended. But there can be no other [Page 141] explanation of a
remarkable passage in the early Chāndogya Upanisad, 7 which describes a
vision of the sage Vaka Dālbhya, wherein dogs move round in a circle, each
holding the tail of the preceding dog in its mouth, “just as the priests do
when about to sing praises”; and then, repeating the very sacred syllable
Ōm, they sing:” Ōm! let us eat! Om! let us drink! Om! may the gods Varuna,
Prajapati and Savitr bring us food!” Another early reference to the gluttony
of brāhmaṇs occurs in the Aitareya brāhmaṇ a, 8 in an interesting passage
which describes the other three classes from the point of view of the
warrior; here the brāhmaṇ is “a receiver of gifts, a drinker of soma, an eater
of food, to be expelled at will”. The vidūṣ aka, the fool of Sanskrit drama (p.

90), an amiable but gluttonous figure of fun, is invariably a brāhmaṇ.

There are, however, few frontal attacks on brāhmaṇical pretensions, even
in the literature of the Buddhists, who came nearest to an anti-brāhmaṇical
point of view; but one brief Buddhist tract, the “Diamond Needle”
( Vajrasūci), ascribed to Aśvaghoṣa, of the 1st or 2nd century A.D., attacks
the claims of the priesthood, and indirectly the whole class system, with
vigorous dialectical skill. The claims of the brāhmaṇ were, in fact, often
ignored, and not wholly unchallenged.

The second class was the ruling one, the members of which were in the
Vedic period called rājanya, and later kṣ atriya. The theoretical duty of the
ksatriya was “protection”, which included fighting in war and governing in
peace (p. 88f). In early times he often claimed precedence over the
brāhmaṇ; this claim is implicit in the Aitareya brāhmaṇ a passage which we
have quoted, the inclusion of which in a brāhmaṇ ical scripture is hard to
account for. According to Buddhist tradition, in times when the brāhmaṇs
are the highest class Buddhas are born in that class, while when ksatriyas
are the highest they are born as ksatriyas. The historical Buddha was a
ksatriya, and his followers evidently had few doubts about class priorities.

Where the names of the four classes are mentioned together in the Pali
scriptures that of the ksatriya usually comes first.

A strong king was always a check on brāhmaṇic pretensions, just as the
brāhmaṇs were a check on the pretensions of the king. Tradition speaks of
many anti-brāhmaṇical kings who came to evil ends, and the legend of
Parasurama, who destroyed the whole ksatriya class for its impiety (p. 303),
must contain a recollection of fierce strife between the two classes in pre-
Buddhist times. After the Mauryan period the brāhmaṇ’s theoretical
position was established throughout most of India, but the ksatriya was in
fact still often his equal or superior.

[Page 142] The martial class of ancient India, from great emperors to
petty chiefs, was recruited from all races and ranks, and all the invaders of
India down to the coming of the Muslims were given a place in the social
order in this way. Manu9 describes the warlike peoples on the fringes of
Āryan civilization, including the Greeks ( Tavana), the Scyths ( Saka), and
the Parthians ( Pahlava), as ksatriyas who had fallen from grace through
their neglect of the Sacred Law, but who could be received once more into
the Āryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and performing
appropriate penitential sacrifices. This provision might be applied to almost
any conquering people, and the Rajputs, in later times the ksatriyas par
excellence, were no doubt largely descended from such invaders.

The ksatriyas claimed and received certain privileges. They continued
old customs not in keeping with orthodoxy, with such persistence that the
brāhmaṇic lawgivers were forced to give them legal status. Thus marriage
by capture was permitted to the ksatriya, as were the clandestine liaison and
the svayaṃ vara, at which a girl chose her husband from among the
assembled suitors (p. 169). Like the brāhmaṇs, they did not always live by
fulfilling their ideal function. The rules of āpad-dharma applied to them
also, and there are many records of men of warrior stock becoming
merchants and craftsmen.

In Vedic times the vaiśya, or mercantile class, though entitled to the
services of the priesthood and to the sacred thread of initiation, was but a
poor third to the brāhmaṇs and kṣatriyas. In the Aitareya brāhmaṇ a
passage to which we have referred the vaiśya is described as “paying tribute
to another, to be lived on by another, to be oppressed at will”. Other
passages in early brāhmaṇic literature show him as a wretched and down-
trodden cultivator or petty merchant, who is of no interest to his betters
except as a source of profit.

According to Manu10 the special duty of the vaiśya was keeping cattle,
which were made over to his charge at the creation of the world. The class
evidently originated in the ordinary peasant tribesman of the R.g Veda, but
long before the lawbook ascribed to Manu was composed it had many other
activities. The śūdras, the humblest of the four classes, had by now taken to
agriculture, and Manu admits many other legitimate vaiśya occupations
besides cattle rearing and farming. The ideal vaiśya has expert knowledge
of jewels, metals, cloth, threads, spices, perfumes, and all manner of
merchandise-he is, in fact, the ancient Indian business-man.

Though the brāhmaṇa literature gives the vaiśya few rights and humble
status, the Buddhist and Jaina scriptures, a few centuries later in date and of
more easterly provenance, show that he was not always [Page 143]
oppressed in practice. They mention many wealthy merchants living in
great luxury, and powerfully organized in guilds. Here the ideal vaiśya is
not the humble taxpaying cattle-breeder, but the asītikotivibhava, the man
possessing eight million panas. Wealthy vaiśyas were respected by kings
and enjoyed their favour and confidence. It was they, rather than the
ksatriyas, who chiefly favoured the rising unorthodox religions of
Buddhism and Jainism. They formed by this time, at least in the regions of
Magadha and Kosala, a true bourgeoisie, no doubt small in number, but
very important. Numerous inscriptions from Sunga times onwards record
the great donations of vaiśya merchants and skilled craftsmen to religious
causes, especially to Buddhism, and show that they were prosperous and
influential.

If the vaiśya, according to the Aitareya Brdhmana, was to be oppressed at
will, the lot of the śūdra was even more unfortunate. He was “the servant of
another, to be expelled at will, to be slain at will” -but the latter phrase may
be interpreted “to be beaten at will”, and the import of the whole passage
seems to be satirical.

śūdras were not “twice-born”. For them there was no initiation into full
Āryan status, and they were not regularly considered Āryans, though the
Arthaśāstra in its chapters on slavery11 specifically mentions them as such.

The śūdra was in fact a second-class citizen, on the fringes of Āryan
society. The word śūdra is of doubtful etymology, and occurs only once in
the Ṛ g Veda; it was perhaps originally the name of a non-Āryan tribe, which
became subordinate to the conquerors, and the origin of the śūdra class may
be accounted for in this way, though it certainly included other elements. As
the rigidity of brāhmaṇic observances increased, groups which refused to
accept orthodox custom, or clung to old practices which were no longer
respectable, fell to the rank of śūdras. There are today castes which
themselves claim to be ksatriyas, but which are branded by the brāhmaṇs as
śūdras because they adhere to customs which have long become
objectionable, such as meat eating or the remarriage of widows. Persons
born illegitimately, even when of pure high-class blood, were officially
counted as śūdras. 12
śūdras were of two kinds, “pure” or “not-excluded” ( aniravasita) and
“excluded” ( niravasita). The latter were quite outside the pale of Hindu
society, and were virtually indistinguishable from the great body of people
later known as untouchables. The distinction was made on the basis of the
customs of the śūdra group in question, and the profession followed by its
members. According to the brāhmaṇical textbooks the chief duty of the
pure śūdra was to wait on the other three classes. He was to eat the
remnants of his [Page 144] master’s food, wear his cast-off clothing, and
use his old furniture. Even when he had the opportunity of becoming
wealthy he might not do so, “for a śūdra who makes money is distressing to
the brāhmaṇs”.13 He had few rights, and little value was set on his life in
law. A brāhmaṇ killing a śūdra performed the same penance as for killing a
cat or dog. 14 The śūdra was not allowed to hear or repeat the Vedas. A land
where śūdras were numerous would suffer great misery.

Thus the textbooks give small hope of happiness to the wretched śūdra,
who could do little but serve his betters in unpleasant and servile tasks, and
whose only hope was rebirth in a higher social class; but there is good
evidence that śūdras did not always live the humble and wretched life laid
down for them in the Sacred Law. There is mention of śūdras engaged in
manufacture and commerce, and by Mauryan times many śūdras were free
peasants.15 The śūdra had a place of sorts in the Hindu fold, and was
encouraged to imitate the customs of the higher classes. Though he might
not hear the Vedas, the Epics and Puranas were open to him, and he had a
part in the devotional religion which became more and more popular from
postMauryan times onwards, and ultimately eclipsed the older cults; in the
Bhagavad Gītā the lord K
a himself promises full salvation to those
śūdras who turn to him.16 From the point of view of most medieval sects,
class and caste were affairs of the body rather than of the spirit, and verses
expressing the fundamental equality of all men are to be found in Dravidian
devotional literature and in vernacular religious literature of later times.

Theoretically Buddhism and Jainism made no class distinctions in religious
affairs. As we have seen, śūdra kings were not unknown, and many śūdras,
despite the injunctions of the lawbooks, must have been prosperous.



UNTOUCHABLES
Below the śūdras were the early representatives of the people who were
later called untouchables, outcastes, depressed classes, or scheduled castes.

Buddhist literature and the early Dharma Sūtras show that several centuries
before Christ there already existed groups of people who, though serving
the Āryans in very menial and dirty tasks, were looked on as quite outside
the pale. Sometimes they were called the “fifth class” ( pañcama), but most
authorities rejected this term, as if to insist that they were excluded from the
Āryan social order altogether.

Numerous groups of these people are mentioned, by names which are
non-Āryan in origin, and were probably those of aboriginal tribes [Page
145] which came under the sway of the advancing Āryans. Chief of these
groups was the caṇḍ āla, a term which came to be used loosely for many
types of untouchable. The caṇḍāla was not allowed to live in an Āryan
town or village, but had to dwell in special quarters outside the boundaries.

Though some caṇḍālas had other means of livelihood, in theory their main
task was the carrying and cremation of corpses, and they also served as
executioners of criminals.

According to the lawbooks the caṇḍāla should be dressed in the
garments of the corpses he cremated, should eat his food from broken
vessels, and should wear only iron ornaments. No man of higher class
might have any but the most distant relations with a caṇḍāla, on pain of
losing his religious purity and falling to the caṇḍāla’s level. By Gupta times
caṇḍālas had become so strictly untouchable that, like lepers in medieval
Europe, they were forced to strike a wooden clapper on entering a town, to
warn the Āryans of their polluting approach.

Certain classes of outcastes or untouchables seem to have gained their
unenviable position through the growth of the sentiment of nonviolence-for
instance the niṣ āda, who was a hunter, the fishing caste called kaivarta, and
the leather worker ( kārāvara). The pukkusa,3 who appears as a sweeper in
Buddhist literature, may have fallen in status because members of his class
made and sold alcoholic liquor. More difficult to account for are such base
classes as basket-maker ( veṇ a) and the chariot-maker ( rathakāra). In early
Vedic times the latter was a most respected craftsmen, but soon fell to the
status of an impure śūdra or outcaste.

By the beginning of the Christian era the outcastes themselves had
developed a caste hierarchy, and had their own outcastes. Manu17 mentions
the antyāvasāyin, a cross between a caṇḍāla and a nisada, who was
despised even by the caṇḍālas themselves. In later India every untouchable
group imagined that some other group was lower than itself, and this
stratification evidently began quite early.

Even the lot of the untouchable was not altogether without hope. Though
he was denied access to the temples and the comforts of orthodox religion,
Buddhist monks preached to him, and the more enlightened wandering
ascetics would give him instruction. The untouchable dying in defence of
brāhmaṇs, cows, women, and children secured a place in heaven. Orthodox
texts contain frequent warnings on the evils which arise when śūdras and
outcastes grow too powerful, and this would seem to show that a caṇḍāla
might occasionally become influential.

Another class of untouchable was the mleccha, the word commonly used
for outer barbarians of whatever race or colour. As an invader [Page 146] he
was loathed, but once he had come into contact with Indian ways and was
less strange and forbidding his status might improve. In fact it was not
blood which made a group untouchable, but conduct. Generally there was
no chance of an individual rising in the social scale, but for a group this was
possible, over a number of generations, by adopting more orthodox
practices and following the rules of the Smśtis. Thus the Indian class system
was always somewhat fluid.



“CONFUSION OF CLASS”
An early legend tells of Viśvāmitra, a ksatriya who, by penance and piety,
became a brāhmaṇ and a seer ( rsi) to boot; but as time went on such raising
of one’s status became more and more difficult, and finally virtually
impossible, though convenient fictions sometimes permitted kings and
chiefs of low status to find legendary ksatriya ancestors and advance in the
class hierarchy. While it became very difficult for the individual to rise, it
grew progressively more easy for him to fall. Every breach of the manifold
regulations of one’s class entailed impurity and outcasting, either permanent
or temporary. The lawbooks give long lists of penances for the restoration
of the unfortunate offender, ranging from trivial ones, such as bathing, or
touching Ganges’ water, to others so rigorous that they must usually have
resulted in the death of the penitent. Secular literature, however, tells many
stories of high-class people infringing the rules of purity without doing
penance, and no doubt the more sophisticated townsman often took his
class responsibilities lightly.

The continual injunctions to the king to ensure that “confusion of class”
( varṇ a-saṃ kara) did not take place indicate that such confusion was an
ever-present danger in the mind of the orthodox brāhmaṇ. The class system
was indeed a very fragile thing. In the golden age the classes were stable,
but the legendary king Vena (p. 87), among his many other crimes, had
encouraged miscegenation, and from this beginning confusion of class had
increased, and was a special feature of the Kali-yuga, the last degenerate
age of this æon, which was fast nearing its close. The good king, therefore,
should spare no effort to maintain the purity of the classes, and many
dynasties took special pride in their efforts in this direction.

Before the tightening of the social system in the Middle Ages confusion
of class was comparatively frequent, and some forms of interclass marriage
were expressly permitted. The type of marriage known to anthropologists as
hypergamous, when the husband is of higher class than the wife, was by no
means disapproved of; on the [Page 147] other hand hypogamous marriage,
when the wife’s status was higher than that of the husband, was always
frowned on. The former was “in accordance with the direction of the hair”
( anuloma), smooth and natural, while the latter was “against the hair”, or
“brushing the wrong way” ( pratiloma). This distinction is to be found in
other societies; for instance in Victorian England the peer who married an
actress rarely incurred the same scorn and ostracism as the lady who
married her groom.

The earlier legal literature permitted anuloma or hypergamous marriage,
provided that a man’s first wife was of his own class. Generally brāhmaṇs
were forbidden to take śūdra wives, but one lawbook allowed even this,18
and Bana, the 7th-century poet, who was a brāhmaṇ, had a stepbrother by a
śūdra mother. Various mixed classes, many of them the forerunners of later
castes, were said to be the products of marriages of this type, and their
members were not looked on as in any way unclean, but enjoyed a position
intermediate between that of the two parents. Of the groups thought to have
descended from hypergamous marriage only the nisada, in theory a cross
between a brāhmaṇ and a śūdra woman, was thought to be impure.

Hypogamous or pratiloma marriage, on the other hand, produced
offspring whose status was lower than that of either parent. Thus the
caṇḍālas were believed to have descended from marriages between śūdras
and brāhmaṇ women. The only exceptions were the class of charioteers, or
sūtas, thought to have sprung from the hypogamy of ksatriyas and
brāhmaṇs, and the bards or māgadhas, descended from vaiśya fathers and
ksatriya mothers, both of whom were well respected. The complex system
of sub-classes low in the social scale, out of which the Indian caste system
developed, was believed to be wholly the result of “confusion of class”.

This tradition was accepted by early Indologists, but, as we shall see, is
completely unfounded.



CASTE
Relations between classes and social groups in later Hinduism were
governed by rules of endogamy (marriage was only legitimate within the
group), commensality (food was only to be received from and eaten in the
presence of members of the same or a higher group), and craft-
exclusiveness (each man was to live by the trade or profession of his own
group, and not take up that of another). Megasthenes noted seven
endogamous and craft-exclusive classes in India-philosophers, peasants,
herdsmen, craftsmen and traders, soldiers, government officials and
councillors. His sevenfold division is certainly [Page 148] false, but he
gives evidence to show that in Mauryan times class divisions were already
hardening. Even in the Gupta period, however, the regulations were by no
means rigid. Hypergamous intermarriage was recognized, the rule of craft-
exclusiveness was often ignored, or circumvented by the convenient escape
clauses of apaddharma (p. 140), and in the earlier lawbooks the brāhmaṇ
was permitted to accept food from any Āryan. It was only in late medieval
times that it was finally recognized that exogamy and sharing meals with
members of other classes were quite impossible for respectable people.

These customs, and many others such as widow-remarriage, were classed as
kalivarjya—customs once permissible, but to be avoided in this dark Kali
age, when men are no longer naturally righteous.

In the whole of this chapter we have hardly used the word which in most
minds is most strongly connected with the Hindu social order. When the
Portuguese came to India in the 16th century they found the Hindu
community divided into many separate groups, which they called castas,
meaning tribes, clans or families. The name stuck, and became the usual
word for the Hindu social group. In attempting to account for the
remarkable proliferation of castes in 18th– and 19th– century India,
authorities credulously accepted the traditional view that by a process of
intermarriage and subdivision the 3,000 or more castes of modern India had
evolved from the four primitive classes, and the term “caste” was applied
indiscriminately to both varna or class, and jāti or caste proper. This is a
false terminology; castes rise and fall in the social scale, and old castes die
out and new ones are formed, but the four great classes are stable. They are
never more or less than four, and for over 2,000 years their order of
precedence has not altered. All ancient Indian sources make a sharp
distinction between the two terms; varṇ a is much referred to, but jāti very
little, and when it does appear in literature it does not always imply the
comparatively rigid and exclusive social groups of later times. If caste is
defined as a system of groups within the class, which are normally
endogamous, commensal and craft-exclusive, we have no real evidence of
its existence until comparatively late times.

Caste is the development of thousands of years, from the association of
many different racial and other groups in a single cultural system. It is
impossible to show its origin conclusively, and we can do little more than
faintly trace its development, since early literature paid scant attention to it;
but it is practically certain that caste did not originate from the four classes.

Admittedly it developed later than they, but this proves nothing. There were
subdivisions in the four classes at a very early date, but the brāhmaṇ gotras,
which go back [Page 149] to Vedic times, are not castes, since the gotras are
exogamous, and members of the same gotra are to be found in many castes.

Perhaps the first faint trace of caste is to be found in the careful
cataloguing of trades and professions in later Vedic literature, as if their
members were looked on almost as distinct species. In the Pali scriptures
many trades and professions are described as living apart; thus we read of
villages of brāhmaṇs, potters, hunters and robbers, and of separate quarters
in the towns for different trades and professions. Many trades were
organized in guilds, in which some authorities have seen the origin of the
trade castes; but these trade groups cannot be counted as fully developed
castes. A 5th-century inscription from Mandasor19 shows us a guild of silk-
weavers emigrating in a body from Lata (the region of the lower Narmada)
to Mandasor, and taking up many other crafts and professions, from
soldiering to astrology, but still maintaining its guild-consciousness. We
have no evidence that this group was endogamous or commensal, and it was
certainly not craft-exclusive; but its strong corporate sense is that of a caste
in the making. Hsüan Tsang, in the 7th century, was well aware of the four
classes, and also mentioned many mixed classes, no doubt accepting the
orthodox view of the time that these sprang from the intermarriage of the
four, but he shows no clear knowledge of the existence of caste in its
modern form.

To the present day the life of the lower orders is much more affected by
caste than by varṇa-it is not being a vaiśya or a śūdra, but being an ahir, a
kāyasth, or a sonār which matters, and corporate feeling is centred around
this caste group, whether based on region, race, profession or religion. The
same strong corporate sense existed among the Mandasor silk weavers, and
evidence of its existence at an even earlier date can be gathered from many
sources. Indian society developed a very complex social structure, arising
partly from tribal affiliations and partly from professional associations,
which was continuously being elaborated by the introduction of new racial
groups into the community, and by the development of new crafts. In the
Middle Ages the system became more or less rigid, and the social group
was now a caste in the modern sense. Professor J. H. Hutton has interpreted
the caste system as an adaptation of one of the most primitive of social
relationships, whereby a small clan, living in a comparatively isolated
village, would hold itself aloof from its neighbours by a complex system of
taboos, and he has found embryonic caste features in the social structure of
some of the wild tribes of present-day India. The caste system may well be
the natural response of the many small and primitive peoples who were
forced to come to terms with a more complex economic and social system.

It [Page 150] did not develop out of the four Āryan varnas, and the two
systems have never been thoroughly harmonized.

By the end of our period many of the present-day caste groups were
already in existence. Even the brāhmaṇ class was much subdivided into
endogamous groups, often based on locality and race, with many different
practices. The Rajputs were divided into clans which, if not regularly
endogamous, were castes of a sort, and the vaiśyas, śūdras, and
untouchables had evolved hundreds of castes. They were governed by local
committees of elders, usually hereditary, which had the power to expel
members and regulate caste rules, and whose decisions, from the time of the
Arthaśāstra onwards, had the force of law.

After the large joint family, the caste provided social security, helping
destitute members and providing for widows and orphans. A man expelled
from his caste was also automatically expelled from his family, unless the
whole family accompanied him in his social ostracism. He was lost to
society, and could only consort with the lowest of the low. Though he might
sometimes retain some of his former wealth he was isolated, a tree torn up
by the roots. Permanent loss of caste was the greatest catastrophe, short of
death and the major chronic diseases, which could happen to a man.

Early Tamil literature gives no evidence of caste, but the growth of Āryan
influence and the development of a more complex political and economic
structure produced a system in some ways more rigid than that of the North.

By the Cōla period an important feature of South Indian caste structure had
appeared, which has survived to the present day. In the Dravidian country
families claiming to be ksatriyas were few, other than the ruling families,
and vaiśyas were equally rare. Nearly the whole of the population were
brāhmaṇs, śūdras or untouchables, and the śūdra castes, which formed the
mass of the people, were divided into two great caste groups, known as the
right and left hands. The great animosity and rivalry which still exists
between these groups is at least a thousand years old. On the right are the
trading castes, some weaving castes, musicians, potters, washermen,
barbers, and most of the cultivating and labouring castes; on the left are
various castes of craftsmen, such as weavers and leather workers, cowherds,
and some cultivating castes. We have no evidence of how this strange
bisection of society arose.

Hypergamy never wholly disappeared. In Malabar, where matrilinear
succession has continued almost to modern times, men of the great
brāhmaṇ caste of Nambūdiris have regularly married the women of the
dominant secular caste, the Nayyars. In Bengal the Raḍhi caste of
brāhmaṇs and the important and respectable castes of [Page 151] scribes
( kāyastha) and doctors ( vaidya) are divided into subcastes, which are
hypergamous. The system is known as “kulīnism”, from the name of the
highest subcaste of the brāhmaṇs ( kulina); it was by tradition imposed by
the Bengal king Vallala Sena (12th century), but is no doubt a survival from
much earlier times.

The organization of the castes, independent of the government, and with
social ostracism as its most severe sanction, was a powerful factor in the
survival of Hinduism. The Hindu, living under an alien political order
imposed from above, retained his cultural individuality largely through his
caste, which received most of the loyalty elsewhere felt towards king,
nation and city. Caste was so strong that all attempts at breaking it down,
until recent years, have ended in failure. Equalitarian religious reformers of
the late Middle Ages, such as Basava, Ramanand, and Kabir, tried to
abolish caste among their followers; but their sects soon took on the
characteristics of new castes, and in some cases divided into castes within
themselves. The Sikhs, despite the outspoken sentiments of their gurus and
the adoption of rites deliberately intended to break down caste prejudice,
such as the ritual meal eaten in common, did not overcome caste feeling.

Even the Muslims, for all their equalitarian faith, formed caste groups. The
Syrian Christians of Malabar early divided into sections which took on a
caste character, and when in the 16th century Roman Catholic missionaries
began to make converts in South India their flocks brought their caste
prejudices with them, and highcaste converts held themselves aloof from
those of the lower orders.

Only in the last fifty years has the caste system shown real signs of
breaking down, thanks to the many inventions of the West not designed for
use in a society divided into watertight compartments, the spread of
Western education, growing national sentiment, and the intensive
propaganda of enlightened leaders. The process is not yet complete, and it
will be many years before all trace of caste feeling is eradicated; but when
Mahatma Gāndhī, in many ways socially conservative, persuaded his
followers to sweep their own floors and clean their own latrines he sounded
the death knell of the old Hindu social order, which, for all its faults, has
preserved the identity of Indian society over centuries of foreign
domination.



SLAVERY
Megasthenes declared that there were no slaves in India. He was
certainly wrong, but Indian slavery was milder than the form to which he
had been used, and slaves were much less numerous than in the civilizations
of the West; hence he may not have recognized the [Page 152] dāsa as a
slave. There was no caste of slaves; though the Arthaśāstra declares that
servitude is not in the nature of the Āryan (in which term the humble śūdra
is explicitly included), an individual of any class might in certain
circumstances become a slave, although most slaves were no doubt of low
caste.

The word dāsa originally meant a member of the peoples conquered by
the Āryans in their first invasions of India. Its later connotation no doubt
developed from the reduction to bondage of the many dasas captured in
battle, and here we find the probable origin of Indian slavery. The
Mahābhārata declares that it is a law of war that the vanquished should be
the victor’s slave, 20 and the captive would normally serve his captor until
ransomed. But there were several other classes of slaves in later times.

Children born of slaves normally became the slaves of their parents’
masters. Slaves might be bought, given away, or mortgaged. A free man
might sell himself and his family into slavery in times of dire distress. He
might also be reduced to slavery for crime or debt, but in these cases his
servitude might be only temporary. All these types of slavery are
recognized in the Smrti literature and elsewhere.

As in other slave-owning civilizations, the slave might become an
important man, and there are even references in stories to slaves serving as
royal counsellors. Slaves might sometimes perform work of economic
importance, such as agriculture or mining, but they were usually domestic
servants or personal attendants. The slave was, in fact, a subordinate
member of his master’s household. His maintenance was his master’s
responsibility, and if he died sonless it was incumbent on the master to
perform funeral and commnemorative rites for the welfare of his soul.

According to most lawbooks a slave’s property ultimately belonged to his

master, and he might be bought, sold, loaned or given away; but masters
had no rights over the lives of their slaves, and were not allowed to abandon
them in old age, as was done in many other ancient civilizations. “A man
may go short himself or stint his wife and children, but never his slave, who
does his dirty work for him. “21 Some lawbooks even limit the right of a
master to give corporal punishment to his slave. “A wife, a son, a slave, a
servant or a younger brother may, when they do wrong, be beaten with a
rope or a cane, but only on the back and not on the head. If a man beats
them otherwise he should be punished as a thief.” 22 The manumission of a
slave is commended by the textbooks as a pious act, and in any case a
person enslaved for debt became free when he had paid the debt with his
labour.

The Arthaśāstra, in many ways more liberal than the religious lawbooks,
lays down regulations appreciably milder than those we [Page 153] have
outlined. The sale of children into slavery is explicitly forbidden except in
dire emergency. Slaves are entitled to own and inherit property, and to earn
money freely in their spare time. Slaves of the upper classes cannot be
forced to perform defiling duties. The chastity of slave-girls is protected-the
master who rapes a slavegirl must set her free and pay her compensation,
and if she has a child by her master, even with her own consent, both
mother and child become free. A promise made by a man in dire necessity
to sell himself and his family into slavery is not binding.

The humane regulations of the Arthaśāstra, probably unique in the
records of any ancient civilization, are perhaps survivals of Mauryan laws,
and it is therefore not surprising that Megasthenes declared that there was
no slavery in India. India, unlike most ancient civilizations, was never
economically dependent on slavery; the labourer, farm worker, and
craftsman alike were normally free men, and the latifundia of the Roman
magnate had no counterpart in India. Slave markets are not mentioned in
early sources, and though provision was made for the sale of slaves they do
not seem at first to have been a regular article of commerce. In the early
centuries of the Christian era, however, there was trade in slave-girls
between India and the Roman empire in both directions, and slave markets
existed in the 16th-century Vijayanagara empire.

There are numerous references in literature to slaves being badly treated
by their masters, and the slave’s lot must have been often a very unhappy
one; but he was probably better off in India than in most parts of the ancient
world. Indeed in many contexts it would seem that the word dasa implies
rather a bondman or serf than a chattel slave.



GOTRA AND PRAVARA
The Hindu social order was complicated by other features which had no
original relationship to class or caste, but were roughly harmonized with
them. These are the institutions of gotra and pravara, which were in
existence in late Vedic times, and probably earlier, and are very important to
the orthodox brāhmaṇ to this day.

The original meaning of gotra is “a cowshed”, or “a herd of cows”; in the
Atharva Veda, 23 the word first appears with the meaning of “a clan”, which
it has retained with a special connotation. Some ancient Indo-European
peoples, such as the Romans, had exogamous clans, as well as generally
endogamous tribes. It may well be that the gotra system is a survival of
Indo-European origin which had developed specially Indian features.

Gotra as it existed in historical times was primarily a brāhmaṇic [Page
154] institution, adopted rather half-heartedly by other twice-born classes,
and hardly affecting the lower orders. All brāhmaṇs were believed to have
descended from one or other ṛṣi, or legendary seer, after whom the gotras
were named. The religious literature generally speaks of seven or eight
primeval gotras, those of Kasyapa, Vasistha, Bhrgu, Gautama, Bharadvaja,
Atri and Viśvāmitra. The eighth gotra, that of Agastya, is named after the
sage who is said to have taken the Vedic religion beyond the Vindhyas, and
who is a sort of patron saint of the Dravidians. His name may have been
added to those of the original seven as the South became progressively
Āryanized. These primeval gotras were multiplied in later times by the
inclusion of the names of many other ancient sages.

Though the gotras perhaps evolved from local units within the Āryan
tribe they had quite lost their tribal character by historical times, and
brāhmaṇs from the furthest parts of India and of different caste groups
might have the same gotra. The chief importance of gotra was in connexion
with marriage, which was forbidden to persons of the same gotra.

The position was further complicated by pravara. In the brāhmaṇ’s daily
worship he mentioned not only the name of the founder of his gotra, but
also the names of certain other sages who were believed to be the remote
ancestors of his family. The formula generally contained three or five
names, and set up a further bar to marriage, for the same names would
occur in the pravaras of families of other gotras. According to the custom of
some gotras, marriage was impossible with a member of another gotra
having one pravara name in common, while others barred intermarriage
only when there were two common names in the pravaras. Thus
matrimonial choice was much restricted, especially when in the Middle
Ages the endogamous caste system was fully established.

The social prestige of the brāhmaṇs led to the respectable classes
adopting a gotra system of some sort. Ksatriyas and vaiśyas took the same
gotra names as the brāhmaṇs; their gotras, however, were not based on the
claim to descent from an ancient sage, but merely on the gotra of the family
of brāhmaṇs which traditionally performed their domestic rituals. As
imposed on non-brāhmaṇic families the system was quite artificial. Non-
brāhmaṇ families were also expected to take the pravaras of their domestic
priests, but this rule counted for little. The real gotras of the ksatriyas and
vaiśyas were secular ( laukika) ones, founded by legendary eponymous
ancestors. Legal literature takes little note of these secular gotras, but
numerous references in inscriptions show that the term was used in the
sense of [Page 155] “sept” or “clan”, and that many non-brāhmaṇ gotras
existed which do not occur in the lists of any of the lawbooks.

Early lawgivers take a comparatively liberal view of breaches of gotra
regulations. A man marrying a woman of the same gotra must perform a
cāndrāyaṇ a penance, a severe fast of a month’s duration, and henceforth
maintain his wife as he would a sister;24 no stigma attaches to the child of
such a marriage. With ruthless logic, however, later jurists declare that this
rule applies only to inadvertent marriage within the gotra; when the
relationship is known the sin is equivalent to that of incest.



THE FAMILY
The Indian family was, and usually still is, a joint one-that is to say a
close link was maintained between brothers, uncles, cousins and nephews,
who often lived under one roof or group of roofs, and who owned the
immovable property of the line in common. Like the European and Semitic
family, it was patriarchal and patrilinear. The father was head of the house
and administrator of the joint property, and, except in Malabar (p. 174f), the
headship descended in the male line.

The ancient Indian family included parents, children, grandchildren,
uncles and their descendants, and various collaterals on the male side. It
might include adopted children, and unless poor it would also possess a
varying number of servants, domestic serfs, and clients; a brāhmaṇ family
might, in addition, find room for a number of students, who were engaged
in a lengthy course of training under the head of the house, and were treated
as members of the family. Thus, especially in a polygamous society where
girls were married very young, it formed a very large group.

The family, rather than the individual, was looked on as the unit of the
social system; thus the population of a given region was generally estimated
in families rather than in heads. The bonds of family were such that
relationships within the group were often blurred or lost sight of; for
instance a son might commonly refer co all his father’s wives
indiscriminately as his mothers, and the distinction between brother and
paternal cousin was not always made clearly-even today the same word is
used for both.

The group was bound together by śrāddha, the rite of commemorating
the ancestors, at which balls of rice called piṇḍ a were offered (p. 177).

Sons, grandsons and great-grandsons of the deceased joined together in
śrāddha, and three generations of the dead were [Page 156] believed to
participate in the benefits of the ceremony. Thus the dead and the living
were linked together by this rite, which, like the ancestor worship of the
Chinese, was a most potent force in consolidating the family. śrāddha
defined the family; those who were entitled to participate in the ceremony
were “co-piṇḍas” ( sapiṇḍ a), members of the family group. The rite, which
is still practised, goes back to Vedic times.

This deep sense of family solidarity led, as might be expected, to
nepotism and various other abuses, and today the joint family system is
beginning to weigh heavily on the younger generations; but it gave a
measure of social security to its members. In distress a man could rely on
his sapindas, and the ne’er-do-well cousin or the indolent good-for-nothing
uncle, living in a corner of the family home in comparative comfort while
adding little or nothing to the family fortunes, was probably just as common
a figure in ancient India as he is today.

Though a powerful and awe-inspiring figure, the paterfamilias was not
usually an arbitrary tyrant; his power, like that of the king, was somewhat
limited by Sacred Law and custom. The jurists differed on the question of
his rights over the family property. In modern times there are two great
schools of family law, called after the legal texts on which they are based
Mitākṣ arā and Dāyabhāga (p. 113); most families of Bengal and Assam
follow the rules of Dayabhaga, while the rest of India generally follows
Mitākṣarā. According to the latter school sons and grandsons have a right
in the family property even before the death of the paterfamilias, who is
little more than a trustee and manager on behalf of the family, without the
right to give property away so as to impoverish his dependents. Dayabhaga
maintains that sons only obtain rights over the property on the death of the
father, but even this school recognizes that he is not an outright owner, but
only a steward for his descendants. Both schools existed in medieval times,
and represent codifications of much earlier practices.

At a very early time fathers may have had absolute rights over their
children, for certain ancient and popular stories remind us of the Hebrew
legends of Abraham and Isaac and Jephthah’s daughter. The most famous of
these is the story of Śunahśepa.

King Hariścandra of Ayodhya was childless, and vowed that if he had a
son he would sacrifice him to the god Varuṇa. Soon a son was born to him,
and named Rohita; but Hariscandra was naturally disinclined to perform his
share of the bargain. In punishment Varuna afflicted him with dropsy. After
some years he decided to sacrifice Rohita, who was now a youth, but he

refused to give his life for the sake of his father’s health, and fled to the
forest, where he lived for six years.

PLATE XXXVIII
[Page 157] One day Rohita met a brāhmaṇ, Ajigarta, and bought his
second son Śunahśepa for a hundred cows, as a substitute for himself.

Varuna agreed to accept the sacrifice of Śunahśepa in place of Rohita, and
the brāhmaṇ boy was sent to the court of Hariscandra to be prepared for
sacrifice. Ajigarta agreed to earn another two hundred cows for binding his
son. to the sacrificial stake and slaying him. The sacrifice was made ready,
and Śunahśepa led to the slaughter; he commenced to sing hymns in praise
of the gods, and his devotion was such that Varuna was moved to
compassion. Hariscandra was cured of his disease, and Śunahśepa lived to
become a great and famous sage.

Another well-known story of the same tenor is that of Naciketas, the
interlocutor of the Katha Upanisad.

The brāhmaṇ Vajasravasa gave away all his wealth to priests performing
sacrifices on his behalf, having promised to give up all that he possessed.

His son, Naciketas, saw that he still had one possession, and asked “Dear
Father, to whom will you give me?” The father made no reply, but when
Naciketas repeated the question a third time he said angrily, “I shall give
you to Death!”
Naciketas obediently went to the palace of Yama, the god of the dead, but
found him not at home; only after he had waited for three nights did the god
return. Yama so regretted his impoliteness in keeping a guest waiting for so
long that he offered Naciketas three boons. With the first the boy was
restored to life, and his father pacified; with the second he learnt the secret
of the fire sacrifice; and with the third he obtained from Yama full
knowledge of the mystery of life after death, which makes up the body of
the poem.

Certain early legal texts do allow a father to give away, sell or abandon
his son, 25 and the legends we have mentioned would confirm that this was
done, 4 but other sources positively forbid such action.26 The father’s right
over the life of his child is nowhere explicitly admitted, but the Arthaśāstra
looks on the killing of a son as among the most heinous forms of murder;
on the other hand even parricide is permissible in self-defence.

Left to itself, a joint family would tend to increase in size until it became
so large as to be unmanageable; hence the Sacred Law made provision for
its break-up. The partition of a large joint family was favoured by the
lawyers, since thus more domestic rites would be performed, and the gods
receive more honour and bless the land more readily. Commonly partition
took place on the death of the paterfamilias, when the property was divided
among the sons. There was no provision for wills in ancient India, and the
eldest son received no special inheritance, except sometimes a very small
weightage amounting to one twentieth of a share. The partition of the
family property [Page 158] was not necessarily postponed until the father’s
death. It regularly occurred if he renounced the world to become an ascetic,
and under the Mitaksara system it might take place even without his
consent, by agreement among the sons, if he was senile, incurably diseased,
had taken to evil courses, or was otherwise incapable of managing the
family affairs. Individual sons, like the Prodigal in the Gospel, might
demand their share and leave the family, though this was not wholly
approved, and was virtually impossible under the Dayabhaga system.

In the partition minute rules, varying somewhat with different authorities,
were laid down as to the shares to be received by other relatives when there
were no sons. Most authorities rejected the rights of women to inherit; but
Yājñvalkya27 lays down an authoritative list of priority in inheritance,
which places the wife, followed by the daughters, immediately after the
sons. The right of a wife to inherit if no sons were living was accepted by
the Mitākṣarā school, which was chiefly based on Yājñvalkya.

The joint family property did not include the individual possessions of
the members; at least from medieval times onwards personal earnings, gifts,
and so on were generally thought to belong to the member of the family
who earned them. This was, however, probably a late concept. Manu28, for
instance, states that the property of a son, wife, or slave belongs to the head
of the household, and the same precept is repeated by some other early
lawgivers; the rights of the paterfamilias, it would seem, tended to grow
less with time.



THE FOUR STAGES OF LIFE
We have seen that for the theorist society involved two concepts; one of
these was class, or varṇ a, while the other was stage of life, or asrama. This
was a later idea than that of class, and was evidently more artificial. Just as
Āryan society was divided into four classes, so the life of the individual
Āryan was divided into four stages; on his investiture with the sacred
thread, when he put his childhood behind him, he became a brahmacārin,
leading a celibate and austere life as a student at the home of his teacher;
next, having mastered the Vedas, or part of them, he returned to his parental
home, and was married, becoming a householder ( grhastha); when, well
advanced in middle age, he had seen his children’s children and had thus
surely established his line, he left his home for the forest to become a
hermit ( vānaprastha); by meditation and penance he freed his soul from
material things, until at last, a very old man, he left his hermitage, and
became a homeless wanderer ( sannyāsin), with all his earthly ties broken.

[Page 159] This scheme, of course, represents the ideal rather than the
real. Many young men never passed through the first stage of life in the
form laid down, while only a few went beyond the second. Many of the
hermits and ascetics of ancient India were evidently not old men, and had
either shortened or omitted the stage of householder. The series of the four
stages is evidently an idealization of the facts, and an artificial attempt to
find room for the conflicting claims of study, family life, and asceticism in a
single lifetime. It is possible that the system of the āśamas was evolved
partly as a counterblast to the unorthodox sects such as Buddhism and
Jainism, which encouraged young men to take up asceticism, and by-pass
family life altogether, a practice which did not receive the approval of the
orthodox, though in later times provision was made for it. Despite their
artificiality, however, the four stages of life were an ideal which many men
in ancient India attempted to follow, and thus they deserve our
consideration. Moreover they serve as a framework round which we can
model the life of the individual.

According to the scheme of the four stages life began not with physical
birth, but with the second birth, or investiture with the sacred thread. Thus
the child was not a full member of the Āryan community, but nevertheless
his existence was hedged around with religious rites, which began even
before his birth. Few religions can have marked the course of the life of
their members with so many rites and ceremonies as Hinduism. According
to the most orthodox calculations there were some forty ceremonies
( saṃ skāra), which covered the whole life of a man from his conception to
his death, some of which were of great importance, and were performed by
all respectable members of the Āryan community.



THE CHILD
Of the various saṃskāra, or personal ceremonies, in the life of the pious
Hindu the first three took place before birth: these were garbhādhāna to
promote conception, puṃ savana, to procure a male child, and
simantonnayana, to ensure the safety of the child in the womb. The birth
ceremony ( jātakarma) took place before the cutting of the umbilical cord,
and involved the whispering of sacred spells ( mantra) in the baby’s ear,
placing a mixture of honey and ghee in his mouth, and giving him a name,
to be kept secret by his parents until his initiation. At birth the child and his
parents were ritually impure, and therefore not entitled to take part in
ordinary religious ceremonies until some ten days later, when the child was
given his public name and the period of impurity ceased. Minor rites of
infancy, not [Page 160] always looked on as particularly sacred, were the
ear-piercing ceremony, and the niskramana, when the child was taken out of
the house, and shown the sun for the first time.

More important was the first feeding (annaprasana). In the child’s sixth
month he was given a mouthful of meat, fish, or rice (in later times usually
the latter) mixed with curds, honey and ghee, to the accompaniment of
Vedic verses and oblations of ghee poured on the fire. The tonsure
(cūdākarma) took place in the third year, and was confined to boys; with
various rites the child’s scalp was shaved, leaving only a topknot, which, in
the case of a pious brāhmaṇ, would never be cut throughout his life.

Another ceremony, not looked on as of the first importance, was carried out
when the child first began to learn the alphabet.

Many of these ceremonies are now rarely if ever practised in their full
form, and it is doubtful if every ancient Indian family, even of the higher
classes, performed them regularly, especially in the case of girls. Their
number, however, shows the importance of the child in the life of his
parents. From the earliest hymns of the Ṛ g Veda sons were looked on as
great blessings. At least one son was almost essential, to perform funeral
rites for his father, and thus ensure his safe transit to the other world.

Adopted sons were but poor substitutes for true sons, and their efficacy at
sraddha ceremonies was dubious. Thus there were strong religious reasons
for the procreation of children. The intense family feeling of Hindu India
enhanced the desire for sons, without whom the line would disappear.

Girls, on the other hand, were incapable either of helping their parents in
the other world or of perpetuating the line, for on marriage, according to
orthodox practice, they became members of their husbands’ families. The
necessity of providing them with dowries also lessened their desirability.

There were thus very practical reasons why girls should be unwanted, and
in a civilization so heavily weighted in favour of the male it is surprising
that there is little evidence of the exposure or infanticide of girls. Rajput
families in later times certainly often destroyed their infant girls, and the
same may well have been done by the very poor at all periods; but no
special reference is made to exposure or infanticide in the early legal texts.

In the best Indian families daughters, though their birth may have been
regretted, were cared for and petted just as sons.

The general impression obtained from the literature is that in ancient
India the child’s life was a happy one. Maxims of the type of “spare the rod
and spoil the child” are rare or non-existent. The small child of ancient
India was generally pampered, humoured, and allowed a degree of freedom
which few children in Europe obtained [Page 161] until modern times. The
loving descriptions of children in poetry nearly always show them as the
spoilt darlings of their parents. Thus Kalidasa:
“With their teeth half-shown in causeless laughter,
and their efforts at talking so sweetly uncertain,
when children ask to sit on his lap
a man is blessed, even by the dirt on their bodies.”29
The speaker of this verse is a great king, and it shows us even the little
children of princes playing naked in the dust, and loved with tenderness by
their elders.

But the undisciplined life of the small child soon came to an end. For the
poor child there was work to do almost as soon as he could walk, and for
the wealthier there were lessons. Normally a boy began to learn the
alphabet in his fourth or fifth year. In the richer homes tutors were
maintained for the children of the family, but, in the Middle Ages,
education was also given at village schools attached to temples. Though
women’s education was never looked on as essential, girls were by no
means neglected, and well-bred women were usually literate.

The curriculum of the child’s early studies seems always to have included
reading and elementary arithmetic, but at this stage of his life he was not a
full member of the Āryan community, and his formal schooling had not yet
commenced. Only on his investiture with the sacred thread was he ready to
learn the Vedas and embark on a detailed course of study calculated to
equip him for his ancestral calling.



INITIATION
The great rite of upanayana, the second birth, whereby a boy became a
full member of his class and of society, was confined to brāhmaṇs,
ksatriyas, and vaiśyas. The śūdras and lower orders could not undergo it,
and were never allowed to hear or learn the most sacred of the scriptures.

The ideal age for the ceremony varied according to class-eight for a
brāhmaṇ, eleven for a ksatriya, and twelve for a vaiśya.

It was a very ancient rite, going back to times before the Āryans divided
into Indian and Iranian branches, for the Zoroastrians had a similar
ceremony, a form of which is still practised by the modern Pārsīs. The
kernel of the ceremony was the investing of the boy, clad in the garments of
an ascetic and with a staff in his hand, with the sacred thread ( yajñopavāta),
which was hung over his right shoulder, and under his left arm, and which
he was expected to wear continuously from that day forward. It was a cord
of three threads, each [Page 162] of nine twisted strands, made of cotton,
hemp, or wool, for brāhmaṇs, ksatriyas, and vaiśyas respectively, and it had
great religious significance, which it still has for the orthodox. Its removal
or defilement involved its owner in great humiliation and ritual impurity,
which could only be expunged by rigorous penance.

The ceremony also involved the whispering of the Gāyatrī in the ear of
the initiate by the officiating brāhmaṇ. This is a verse from a hymn of the
Ṛ g Veda,30 addressed to the old solar god Savitr, which is still looked on as
the most holy passage of that most holy scripture. It is repeated in all
religious rites and ceremonies, and has a position in Hinduism rather like
that of the Lord’s Prayer in Christianity, except that the Gayatri may only be
uttered by the three higher classes.

Tát Savitur váreniam
bhārgo devásya dhīmahi,
dhiyo yó nah pracodáyāt.

Let us think on the lovely splendour
of the god Savitr,
that he may inspire our minds.

Probably even before the Christian era many ksatriyas and vaiśyas had
ceased to perform the initiation ceremony in the full form, for the term
“twice-born”, applying to all who had undergone the ceremony, became
more and more looked on as a synonym of brāhmaṇ. Some non-brāhmaṇ
castes, however, maintain the ceremony to the present day, and it is still
performed in orthodox brāhmaṇ families. Normally the initiation was
confined to boys, though in Vedic times girls were also sometimes initiated.

In this initiation ceremony there was little or no trace of overt sexual
symbolism, and it was never thought of, like circumcision and other
initiation ceremonies among more primitive peoples, as a rite fitting the
initiate for sexual life. The initiated boy was still a minor, but he had taken
the status of an Āryan, and it was now his duty to master the religious lore
of the Āryans in order to prepare himself for the role of a householder. As a
brahmacārin or religious student he had as yet several years of celibacy
before him.



EDUCATION
According to the ideal of the sacred texts, the training of the brahmacarin
took place at the home of a brāhmaṇ teacher ( guru). In some early sources
the guru is depicted as a poor ascetic, and it is one [Page 163] of the
student’s duties to beg food for his teacher, but this rule seems not to have
been regularly followed. The student was, however, expected to treat his
teacher with the utmost reverence, ministering to all his needs, and obeying
all his commands implicitly.

Among the first lessons of the student was the performance of sandhyā,
the morning, noon, and evening devotions, which included reciting the
Gayatrl, restraint of the breath, sipping and sprinkling water, and pouring
libations of water to the sun, which was looked on rather as a symbol of the
special deity of the worshipper, whether Visnu or Śiva, than as the Sungod
himself. These rites were incumbent upon all the twice-born, and in various
forms are still performed.

The main subject of study was the Veda, and long hours were devoted to
its mastery. The teacher would instruct the few students seated on the
ground about him by rote, and for many hours daily they would repeat verse
after verse of the Vedas, until one or more was mastered. Sometimes, to
ensure correctness, the hymns were taught in more than one way, first with
the words connected, then in their isolated form ( padapatha), and then with
the words interwoven in ab, be, cd pattern ( kramapātha), or in even more
complicated ways. This remarkable system of mnemonic checks and the
patience and brilliant memories of many generations of teachers and
students preserved the Vedas for posterity in much the same form as that in
which they existed nearly a thousand years before Christ.

The boys in the guru’s home did not confine their attention wholly to the
Vedic texts. There were other fields of study, notably the “Limbs of the
Veda”, or subsidiary sciences, necessary for its proper understanding. These
six vedāngas consisted of: kalpa, the performance of sacrifice; śiksā,
correct pronunciation, or phonetics; chandas, metre and prosody; nirukta,
etymology, the interpretation of obscure words in the Vedic texts;
vyākarana, grammar; and jyotisa, astronomy, or the science of the calendar.

Moreover in post-Vedic times teachers would often instruct their students in
the six schools of metaphysics, or in that school which they specially
favoured. Those versed in the Sacred Law would expound it to their
students, while others would teach special secular subjects, such as
astronomy, mathematics or literature.

The writers of Smrti envisaged all young men of the upper class as
undergoing this training. Such was not the case-in fact it is doubtful if more
than a small proportion of young men ever went through a full course of
Vedic education. Princes and the sons of chiefs and nobles were trained in
arms and in all the manifold sciences needed to fit them for government,
while most boys of the lower orders [Page 164] probably learnt their trades
from their fathers. The Buddhist scriptures, however, show that there was a
form of apprenticeship, and the lawbooks lay down rules governing it.

Certain cities became renowned for their learned teachers, and achieved a
reputation comparable to that of the university cities of medieval Europe.

Chief among these were Banāras and Taksasila, which were already famous
in the time of the Buddha; later, around the beginning of the Christian era,
Kāñcī acquired a similar reputation in the South. Banaras, then usually
called Kāśī, was particularly renowned for its religious teachers, but
Taksasila, in the far NorthWest, laid more emphasis on secular studies. The
Buddhist Jataka tales show that young men from all over the civilized part
of India sought education in this city, through which a trickle of Iranian and
Mesopotamian influence found its way to India. Among the famous learned
men connected with Taksasila were Panini, the grammarian of the 4th
century B.C. (p. 388), Kautilya, the brāhmaṇ minister of Candragupta
Maurya, and traditionally the chief master of the science of statecraft, and
Caraka, one of the two great masters of Indian medical science.

Though it was the ideal of the Smrtis that a small number of students
should study under a single teacher, it seems that veritable colleges existed
at these “university towns”. Thus we read of an establishment at Banāras
with 500 students and a number of teachers, all of whom were maintained
by charitable donations. Ideally, again, the teacher asked no fee; the
students repaid him for his teaching by their reverent service, and only at
the end of their studies was he presented with a gift, traditionally a cow.

Manu, however, makes it quite clear that there were venal teachers who
were willing to teach the Vedas for money. 31 A Jataka story tells of a
teacher of Taksasila who made his ordinary pupils wait on him all day,
while those who paid fees were treated like his own children. At Taksasila,
also, the rules of the Smrti were relaxed in another respect, for we read of
married students, who did not live in their masters’ houses, but had homes
of their own, and only visited their teachers for lectures.

With Buddhism and Jainism education centred not on the teacher’s home,
but on the monastery. Every monastery might give training to postulants,
but quite early in the history of these two religions certain establishments
acquired a special reputation as centres of learning. In the Middle Ages
some developed into true universities. The most famous of these was the
Buddhist monastery of Nalanda in Bihār, which, founded in Gupta times,
remained the most famous teaching centre of medieval Buddhism until it
was pillaged by the invading Muslims. Our knowledge of the day-to-day
life of [Page 165] Nalanda depends chiefly on Hsüan Tsang, who shows us
the monastery in the 7th century as full of intellectual activity. Under its
aged and saintly abbot, Śīlabhadra, Nālandā did not confine itself to training
novices for the Buddhist order, but also taught the Vedas, Hindu philosophy,
logic, grammar and medicine. It would seem that the student population
was not confined to the Buddhist order, but that students of other faiths who
succeeded in passing a strict oral examination were admitted.

According to Hsüan Tsang, Nālandā was supported by the revenues of an
enormous estate of one hundred villages, and by the alms of many patrons,
including the great Harsa himself; it provided free training for no less than
10,000 students, who had a large staff of servants to wait on them. The
remains of Nalanda, however, belie Hsüan Tsang (pl. XII). The monastery
consisted of a very large complex of buildings, but it could hardly have
accommodated a thousand monks in anything like the comfort described by
the Chinese traveller.

Many other Buddhist monasteries all over the country, and Jaina
monasteries in the West and South, served as centres of learning, as did
their Christian counterparts in medieval Europe. In the Middle Ages a
Hindu monasticism developed, and the maṭ has of the Hindu orders also
became centres of learning.



MARRIAGE
Ideally studenthood lasted for twelve years, though it might be
terminated when the student had mastered one Veda. A few very earnest
students took vows of perpetual celibacy, and continued religious studies
throughout their whole lives. Normally, however, the young man in his
early twenties would return home, to resume the everyday life of his class.

He would take a ritual bath, and reward his teacher according to the means
of his family. From now on he was a snātaka (“one who has bathed”), and
he might enjoy normal worldly pleasures, eat any kind of food usually eaten
by his class, and wear fine clothes and jewellery, which he put on at a
special homecoming ceremony ( samāvartaṇ a).

It was generally thought advisable for a snataka to marry as soon as
possible, for unless he had taken a vow of religious celibacy marriage and
the procreation of children were a positive duty. Marriage had three main
purposes: the promotion of religion by the performance of household
sacrifices; progeny, whereby the father and his ancestors were assured of a
happy after-life, and the line was continued; and rati, or sexual pleasure.

[Page 166] The normal religious marriage was and still is arranged by the
parents of the couple, after much consultation, and the study of omens,
horoscopes, and auspicious physical characteristics. The couple were
usually of the same class and caste, but of different gotras and pravaras, if
they were of high class. Rules of prohibited degrees were very strict,
especially in Northern India, where, even in a caste which disregarded
gotra, marriage was forbidden between persons with a common paternal
ancestor within seven generations or a maternal ancestor within five. In the
Deccan, however, this rule was not strictly followed, and there are records
of cousin-marriage even in ruling families.

Though in early times it was usual for girls to be fully adult before
marriage, the Smrtis recommend that while a husband should be at least
twenty a girl should be married immediately before puberty. So
philoprogenitive had Hindu orthodoxy become that it was even declared
that a father who did not give his daughter in marriage before her first
menstruation incurred the guilt of one procuring abortion (a very grave sin,
worse than many kinds of murder) for every menstrual period in which she
remained unmarried.32 The general view was that the ideal marriage was
one in which the bride was one third the age of the groom-thus a man of
twenty-four should marry a girl of eight.33
The marriage of boys, whether before or just after puberty, is nowhere
suggested, but the ideal of a rigorous period of studentship before marriage
is always maintained. The child-marriage of both parties, which became
common in later times among well-to-do families, has no basis at all in
sacred literature, and it is very doubtful whether the child-marriage of girls
was at all common until the late medieval period. The heroines of poetry
and fiction are apparently full grown when they marry, and the numerous
inscriptions which throw much light on the customs of the time give little or
no indication of child-marriage. Ancient Indian medical authorities state
that the best children are produced from mothers over sixteen, and
apparently recognize the practice of child-marriage as occasionally
occurring, but disapprove of it.34
The reasons for the development of child-marriage cannot be given with
certainty. Some have suggested that the fear of marauding Muslims
encouraged parents to marry their daughters in childhood and to confine
their wives more strictly in their homes; but both these customs existed in
pre-Muslim times, so this cannot be the only reason. It may in part be due to
the growing religious insistence on the necessity of progeny, but this was
strong at all times. The sexuality of the Indian character may have played
some part in it. [Page 167] A woman was thought to be naturally libidinous;
an unmarried girl attaining puberty would proceed to find a lover, however
strictly her parents guarded her; once she had lost her virginity she would
become unmarriageable and the parents would have the choice of the
disgrace and expense of maintaining an unmarried daughter indefinitely, or
the even greater disgrace of casting her out to become a beggar or a
prostitute. From the point of view of her parents a daughter was a serious
economic liability, and this may have encouraged the custom.

Religious marriage was solemnized by very complicated ceremonies, the
expenses of which fell on the family of the bride, and, with the dowry, were
a very heavy burden to her father and family. To this day Hindu parents will
often involve themselves in crippling debts in order to marry their
daughters. Though the rules for the wedding ceremony laid down in
different textbooks vary in details, the rite differed little from that of the
present day, or from the marriage ceremony of the Ṛ g Veda. The
bridegroom, decked in great finery and attended by a train of friends and
relatives, proceeded to the bride’s home and was received by her father with
a madhuparka, an auspicious ceremonial drink of honey and curds. Usually
the ceremony was held in a gaudy temporary pavilion in the courtyard of
the house. Bride and groom entered the pavilion separately, and sat on
either side of a small curtain. To the accompaniment of sacred verses
muttered by the officiating brāhmaṇ the curtain was removed, and the
couple saw one another, often for the first time. The bride’s father stepped
forward, and formally gave her to the groom, who promised that he would
not behave falsely to her in respect of the three traditional aims of life-piety,
wealth, or pleasure. Next, offerings of ghee and rice were made in the
sacred fire. The groom then grasped the bride’s hand while she offered
grain in the fire, round which he then led her, usually with their garments
knotted together, after which she trod on a millstone. The couple then took
seven steps together, the bride treading on a small heap of rice at each step.

Then they were sprinkled with holy water and the main part of the
ceremony was completed.

As described above the rite seems comparatively simple, but it was
complicated by the recitation of many mantras, or Vedic and other verses
believed to have magical and spiritual efficiency. Even at this stage the
marriage ceremony was not completely over. The newly married pair
returned to the bridegroom’s house, where a further sacrifice to the
domestic fire was performed. In the evening it was incumbent upon them to
look at the Pole Star, a symbol of faithfulness. For three nights the couple
were expected to remain continent; in some [Page 168] texts they are
allowed to sleep together with a staff between them, but others instruct
them to sleep apart on the ground. On the fourth night the husband
performed a rite to promote conception, and the marriage was
consummated.5
The length and solemnity of this ceremony will give some idea of the
importance and sanctity of marriage in the eyes of ancient Indian lawgivers;
but the form of marriage which we have described, though now regular
among respectable Hindus, was not the only one known to ancient India,
and a marriage might be considered binding even when the religious
ceremony had not been performed. The textbooks enumerate eight types of
marriage, named after various gods and supernatural beings:
(1) brāhma, marriage of a duly dowered girl to a man of the same class
by the ceremony described above.

(2) Daiva, when a householder gives a daughter to a sacrificial priest as
part of his fee.

(3) Ārṣ a, in which, in place of the dowry, there is a token bride-price of a
cow and a bull.

(4) Prājādpatya, in which the father gives the girl without dowry and
without demanding bride-price.

(5) Gāndharva, marriage by the consent of the two parties, which might
be solemnized merely by plighting troth. This form of marriage was often
clandestine.

(6) Asura, marriage by purchase.

(7) Rākṣ asa, marriage by capture.

(8) Paiśāca, which can scarcely be called marriage at all-the seduction of
a girl while asleep, mentally deranged, or drunk.

Of these eight forms the first four were generally approved, and were
permissible to brāhmaṇs; these were religious marriages, and were
indissoluble. The other forms were looked on with varying degrees of
disfavour by the pious. GĀndharva marriage, which often might amount to
no more than a liaison, was surprisingly respected. Some doubts existed as
to whether it was possible to brāhmaṇs, but it was certainly allowed to the
warrior class and the lower orders. It forms the basis of many romantic
stories, and has given rise to one of the stock figures of later poetic
convention-the abhisārikā, the girl who secretly leaves her father’s home by
night to meet her lover at the appointed trysting place.

Asura marriage, in which the bride was bought from her father, was
looked on with disfavour by all the sacred texts, though the Arthaśāstra
allows it without criticism. There is evidence that [Page 169] marriage by
purchase, as well as the orthodox marriage with dowry, existed even in
Vedic times, but it was not a true Āryan custom, and was only allowed as a

sop to the evil propensities of man. Rākṣ asa marriage, or marriage by
capture, was practised especially by warriors. The most famous example,
according to later tradition, was the marriage of Prthvlraja Cahamana, the
last great Hindu king of North India, with the daughter of Jayaccandra of
Kanyakubja, whom he carried off as a not unwilling captive. Epigraphy and
tradition record several other instances. Paiśāca marriage was universally
reprobated. The names of the last three types are derived from those of
demons, of which the Paiśāca was the lowest and most repulsive. This form
of marriage, according to the lawbooks, was not fitted for the higher
classes, and could only be allowed on suffrance to the lower orders.

PLATE XLII
Some authorities have tried to explain away the less reputable forms of
marriage, and to prove that they were non-existent or very rare; but it is
hardly likely that the lawgivers would have admitted these forms, of which
they wholeheartedly disapproved, if they had not had a solid basis in
ineluctable social custom. It would seem that, with surprising realism, they
recognized a wide range of relationships, so that the girl seduced by her
lover’s promises or carried off by raiders would have some legal claim to
wifely status, and her child some degree of legitimacy. No doubt among the
upper classes most marriages were of the first type, and any of the other
forms might be solemnized later by religious rites and thus raised in status.

A special form of the gandharva marriage was the svayaṃ vara or “self-
choice”. The law books lay down that if a girl is not married by her parents
soon after attaining puberty she may choose her own husband, and
evidently marriage by the choice of the bride sometimes took place. Epic
literature shows that more than one form of svayamvara was practised.

Princess Sāvitrī toured the country in her chariot in search of a suitable
mate, until she found Satyavant, the woodcutter’s son. Damayanti chose her
husband Nala at a great ceremony, at which she passed along the assembled
ranks of her suitors until she found the man of her choice. Another form of
svayaṃvara was that by which Rama won Slta, at a great archery contest.

We have references to the performance of svayaṃvaras as late as the 11th
century, for Vikramaditya VI, the great king of the Calukyas, is said to have
obtained brides by this method. The svayamvara was normally concluded
by the performance of the rites of religious marriage, and later legal
commentators maintain that no form of marriage is complete without the
religious ceremony, at least in an abridged form.

[Page 170] With the long marriage ceremony completed the householder
might devote himself to the three ends of life, a classification commonly
found in both religious and general literature. The three are: dharma,
gaining religious merit through following the Sacred Law; artha, gaining
wealth by honest means; and kama, pleasure of all kinds. The three were of
descending order of importance, and it was thought that where the interests
of one end conflicted with those of another the higher should have priority.

The two latter ends need little explanation, but for the high class Indian the
first involved numerous religious duties, notably the performance of birth,
marriage, funeral, and other ceremonies, and the regular carrying out of the
“Five Great Sacrifices” ( pañca-mahāyajña).

The greatness of these sacrifices lay not in their expense or complexity,
but in their importance. They were to be performed daily and consisted of:
(1) Brahmayajña, the worship of Brahman, the World-Spirit, by reciting
the Vedas.

(2) Pitṛ ryajña, the worship of the ancestors, by libations of water and
periodical sraddhas.

(3) Devayajña, worship of the gods, by pouring ghee on the sacred fire.

(4) Bhutayajna, the worship of all things living, by scattering grain and
other food on the threshold for animals, birds, and spirits.

(5) Puruṣayajña, the worship of men, by showing them hospitality.

Ideally the five great sacrifices should be performed thrice a day, at the
sandhyas, or periods of worship at sunrise, noon and sunset.



SEXUAL RELATIONS
Though the learned brāhmaṇs who composed the Smrti literature and
laid down canons of behaviour for the Indian layman were puritanical in
many respects, they did not disparage physical love. Of the three ends of
life the third, pleasure, though less important than the other two, was a
legitimate branch of human activity, for which provision had to be made in
the scheme of existence. In its broadest sense the word kama means desire
of every kind and its fulfilment, but, like such English words as “desire”
and “passion”, it usually had a sexual connotation. Of all legitimate
pleasures sexual pleasure was thought to be the best.

The literature of Hindu India, both religious and secular, is full of sexual
allusions, sexual symbolism, and passages of frank eroticism. The
preoccupation with such themes increased in the Middle Ages, when the
process of cosmic creation was figured as the union of god [Page 171] and
goddess, and figures of closely embracing couples ( maithuna) were carved
on the walls of temples. Some religious sects even introduced ritual
intercourse as part of their cult, and a potent aid to salvation. But the
exaggerated sexual religiosity of the later Middle Ages was only an
expression of the vigorous sexuality which was to be found in Indian social
life at all times. Sexual activity was indeed a positive religious duty-the
husband must have intercourse with his wife within a period of eight days at
the close of every menstruation.

The Indian passion for classification, though it did not result in the
emergence of experimental science, led to the development of rather
pedantic schools on many aspects of human activity, including sexual
relations. On this topic a number of textbooks survive, the most important
and earliest of which is the Kāmasūtra, attributed to the sage Vatsyayana,
and written in the early centuries of the Christian era, or perhaps in the
Gupta period. This remarkable work gives, as may be imagined, detailed
instructions on erotic technique, aphrodisiac recipes and charms, and much
very valuable information about the life of the ancient Indian. From texts
such as this, and from many passages in courtly literature, we may learn
much about the sexual life of the upper classes.

Sexuality was not looked on as a mere vent for the animal passions of the
male, but as a refined mutual relationship for the satisfaction of both
parties. The sophisticated townsman for whom the Kāmasūtra was written
was advised to consider the satisfaction of his mistress as well as his own,
for she was as passionate as himself, and it was even said by some that her
pleasure in sex was greater than his. Loveplay was manifold and thoroughly
classified; thus the Kāmasūtra defines no less than sixteen types of kiss.

There was much tenderness in lovemaking, though it often culminated in
very violent embraces; it was a favourite poetic convention to describe
lovers of both sexes, whether married or single, as displaying the tokens of
their passion to their confidential friends, in the form of the marks of nails
and teeth.

The erotic preoccupations of ancient India are made very evident in art
and literature. The ideal of feminine beauty in ancient India differed very
greatly from the matronly type of the Greeks, or the slender more boyish
type of modern Europe and America. The Indian ideal, thick-thighed, broad
hipped, but very slender-waisted, and with heavy breasts, seems evidently
chosen for physical satisfaction. The poets loved to describe their heroines
in terms of luxurious frankness. They did, however, observe certain
conventional restraints. The preliminaries of sexual intercourse are treated,
and it is recollected in tranquillity in general terms, but the act itself is
rarely if [Page 172] ever described in detail until a very late period.

Detailed descriptions occur in vernacular poetry, but the poets of India’s
greatness preferred to leave something at least unsaid.

As an example of the better side of Indian sexual life we quote from the
Kāmasūtra:
“For the first three days after their marriage husband and wife
should sleep on the floor and abstain from intercourse…. For the next
seven days they should bathe to the sound of music, adorn themselves,
dine together, and pay their respects to their relatives and to the other
people who attended their wedding…. On the evening of the tenth day
the husband should speak gently to his wife… to give her
confidence…. Vatsyayana recommends that a man should at first
refrain from intercourse, until he has won over his bride and gained her
confidence, for women, being gentle by nature, prefer to be won over
gently. If a woman is forced to submit to rough handling from a man
whom she scarcely knows she may come to hate sexual intercourse,
and even to hate the whole male sex… or she may grow to detest her
husband in particular, and will then turn to another man.”35

Vatsyayana then gives a detailed example of the courtship of a newly
married bride by her husband, which would win the approval of most
modern psychologists.

The erotic life of ancient India was generally heterosexual.

Homosexualism of both sexes was not wholly unknown; it is condemned
briefly in the lawbooks, and the Kāmasūtra treats of it, but cursorily, and
with little enthusiasm. Literature ignores it. In this respect ancient India was
far healthier than most other ancient cultures. Another unpleasant feature of
ancient civilizations, the eunuch, was also rare, though not completely
unknown. Castration, whether of men or animals, was disapproved of, and
harems were generally guarded by elderly men and armed women.



DIVORCE
From the point of view of the Sacred Law a marriage was indissoluble,
once the seven steps had been taken together. Even if not consummated it
could not be annulled, and divorce was quite impossible. An errant wife lost
most of her rights, but her husband was still responsible for her bare
maintenance if it was demanded, and she was not entitled to remarry. The
lawbooks vary in their attitude to the adulterous wife; generally if she had
wilful intercourse with a man of base caste her lot was hard; Manu36 and
some other sources even lay down that she should be torn apart by dogs.

But the [Page 173] adulteress who strayed with a man of higher caste was
more fortunate; most authorities agree that she should be made to wear dirty
clothes, sleep on the ground, and eat only enough food barely to sustain life,
until her next menstruation; thereafter she might be restored to her
husband’s bed and her old position in the household.

Though the religious lawbooks leave no room for divorce, the
Arthaśāstra37 shows that it was possible in early times, at least in marriages
not solemnized by religious rites. In this case divorce was allowed by
mutual consent on grounds of incompatibility, and one party might obtain
divorce without the consent of the other if apprehensive of actual physical
danger from his or her partner. The Arthaśāstra would allow divorce even
after religious marriage to a wife who has been deserted by her husband,
and lays down waiting periods of from one to twelve years, which vary
according to circumstances and class.38 These provisions, however, do not
appear in later lawbooks, and were probably forgotten by Gupta times,
when divorce became virtually impossible for people of the higher classes.

Among many lower castes, however, divorce is still permitted by custom,
and this must also have been the case in earlier days.



POLYGAMY
The ordinary people of India, as of every other part of the world, were
generally monogamous, though even in the time of the Ṛ g Veda polygamy
was not unknown. Kings and chiefs were almost invariably polygamous, as
were many brāhmaṇs and wealthier members of the lower orders.

Polygamy, in ordinary circumstances, was not encouraged by the earlier
legal literature. One Dharma Sūtra39 definitely forbids a man to take a
second wife if his first is of good character and has borne him sons. Another
later source states that a polygamist is unfit to testify in a court of law.40
The Arthaśāstra 41 lays down various rules which discourage wanton
polygamy, including the payment of compensation to the first wife. The
ideal models of Hindu marriage are the hero Rama and his faithful wife
Sita, whose mutual love was never broken by the rivalry of a co-wife.

However, polygamous marriages are so frequently mentioned that we may
assume that they were fairly common among all sections of the community
who could afford them.

A husband was told to treat his wives alike, but this was a rule which
could hardly be enforced by law and which was usually a psychological
impossibility. Tied to her husband’s home, the first wife often felt bitterly
the happiness of her rival.

[Page 174] “Grief of the man who loses all his wealth,
and of him whose son is slain;
grief of a wife who has lost her lord,
and of him whom the king has made captive;
grief of a childless woman,
and of him who feels the breath of a tiger at his back;
grief of the wife whose husband has married another woman,
and of one convicted by witnesses in court—
these griefs are all alike.”42
Several of the courtly dramas deal with the jealousy of the king’s senior
wife towards the latest object of her lord’s affections, but they invariably
end on a happy note, with the acceptance by the old queen of her younger
rival. Polygamous households were not necessarily unhappy, and the first
wife might console herself, if she had male children, with the knowledge
that she was the chief wife, the mistress of the household, entitled to the
first place beside her husband at the family rites.

If polygamy was common, its reverse, polyandry, was not wholly
unknown, though it was impossible for ordinary people of respectable class
in most parts of India. “For brother to take the wife of brother,” writes one
legal text, “is a great sin, though in other lands it is even known to marry a
girl to an entire family”.43 The locus classicus of ancient Indian polyandry
is the Mahabharata, where the heroes, the five Pandava brothers, shared
their wife, Draupadi, in common. Lawyers were hard put to it to explain
this abnormal matrimonial arrangement, but it is well known among the
Mongolian hill tribes to this day, and also among certain low castes in the
Deccan. There are a few other references to polyandry here and there in
Indian literature.

Among the Nayyars of Malabar a practice prevailed until comparatively
recent times, no doubt a survival of remote antiquity, which was different
from the group marriage of the Himalayan tribes, and was connected with
the local matrilinear family system. A girl was married, as a sop to Āryan
convention, to a man hired for the purpose; the marriage was not
consummated and she might never see her husband again. She remained in
the family home, and the fact of her marriage was published; when it
became known, she was courted by the eligible men of the neighbourhood,
from whom she chose her true husband, often a Nambūidiri brāhmaṇ, who
was accepted without ceremony. The children of the union took their
mother’s name, and the inheritance passed through her line, though the
eldest male of the family acted as head of the house. The husband had no
rights over his wife’s family at all, and might take less interest in his
children [Page 175] than did their maternal uncle. He might be discarded by
the mother of his children and replaced by another suitor, though real
promiscuity on her part was frowned upon. The Malabār system of
marumakkattāyam shows that the pattern of matrimonial relations had more
variety than allowed by the legal texts.

In his efforts to produce a son a man might without slur on his character
take a second wife, if his first was barren, and so on indefinitely; indeed in
these circumstances polygamy was a religious duty. If the husband was
sterile or impotent he had to take further measures. In the last resort he
would appoint a close relative, usually a brother, to produce offspring on his
behalf. From several stories in the Epics and elsewhere it appears that holy
men of special sanctity were also often in demand for this purpose, and
practices of this kind are said to take place occasionally even at the present
day.

Similarly, if the husband died without producing male issue his brother
might act on his behalf. This practice of levirate ( niyoga) was well known
in many ancient societies, and references to it are common in early Indian
legal literature. Before the beginning of the Christian era, however, it began
to be disapproved of, and medieval writers include it among the now
forbidden kalivarjya customs, which were permitted in earlier ages.



OLD AGE AND DEATH
According to the letter of the Sacred Law, when a householder’s hair
turns white, and he sees his sons’ sons, he should become a hermit, either
leaving his wife to the care of his children or taking her to the forest with
him. There, living in a little hut on the alms of villagers or food collected
from the wilds, he should perform regular rites at his sacred fire and study
the Upanisads, in order to raise his soul above earthly things. He may add to
his hardships by deliberate selfmortification. “In summer he should sit
exposed to the heat of five fires, in the rainy season he should live under the
sky, in winter he should wear wet clothes, and so he should gradually
augment his hardships.”44 This is the stage of life of the vānaprastha, the
forest hermit.

Before death there is yet another stage through which to pass. When all
last attachments to worldly things have passed away the hermit may leave
his forest retreat, give up the performance of all ceremonies, and become a
homeless wanderer ( sannyasin), with nothing but a staff, a begging bowl,
and a few rags of clothing:
“He should not wish to die,
nor hope to live,
but await the time appointed,
as a servant awaits his wages….

[Page 176] “He must show no anger
to one who is angry.

He must bless the man who curses him…
He must not utter false speech.

“Rejoicing in the things of the spirit, calm,
caring for nothing, abstaining from sensual pleasure,
himself his only helper,
he may live on in the world, in the hope of eternal bliss.”45
We must not imagine that more than a small proportion of elderly men
followed these drastic means of achieving salvation. For the ordinary man
the status of householder was enough, and he was content with the hope of
a long period of conditioned bliss in heaven, followed by another happy
birth on earth-the fate assured to the householder who fully maintained the
rites and ethics of the Āryan. But the number of elderly men who took up
asceticism was considerable, and the desire of adult and married sons to
obtain control of the family property no doubt encouraged the asceticism of
their parents. Even today it is not unusual for an elderly man to follow the
course laid down by the ancient sages, and to end his days in asceticism,
though nowadays his hermitage may be a hut in the family compound, or a
secluded room in his old home.

As a man was born in impurity so he died in impurity. Nearly all ancient
peoples had a horror of contact with a corpse, and India was no exception.

No doubt the idea of ritual impurity originated in a very primitive belief in
demons, but it survived in the advanced civilization of classical India, when
its basis was no longer properly recognized. According to the Sacred Law
mourners must avoid all close contact with outsiders for fear of carrying
pollution; they must submit to rigid dietary restrictions, and sleep on the
ground; they must not shave their hair, or worship the gods. The caṇḍālas,
who had the duty of laying out and shrouding the body and carrying it to the
cremation ground, were the most inauspicious of creatures, and the lowest
of the low.

The funeral ceremonies ( antyesti) were the last of the many sacraments
which marked the stages of a man’s life. According to the most favoured
Āryan custom the corpse was carried to the burning ground as soon as
possible after death, followed by the mourners, the eldest leading; it was
cremated, to the accompaniment of sacred texts; the mourners
circumambulated the pyre, not in the auspicious clockwise direction, but
anti-clockwise; then they bathed in the nearest river, tank or lake, and
returned home, this time led by the youngest. [Page 177] On the third day
after the cremation the charred bones of the dead were gathered up and
thrown into a river, preferably the Ganges.

For ten days after the cremation libations of water were poured for the
dead, and offerings of rice-balls ( piṇḍ a) and vessels of milk were made for
him. On death a man’s soul became a miserable ghost ( preta), unable to
pass on to the World of the Fathers or to a new birth, and liable to do harm
to the surviving relatives. With the performance of the last antyesti rite on
the tenth day it acquired a subtle body with which to continue its journey,
speeded on its way and nourished in the after-life with the pindas offered at
periodical sraddha ceremonies. With the tenth day, the mourners ceased to
be impure, and resumed their normal lives.

This funeral ceremony was that followed by the upper classes in ancient
India, and is no different from that of present-day Hinduism. There were
other funeral customs, however. The Harappā people buried their dead,
while the early Āryans did not throw the charred remains into a river, but
buried them, in the case of important people under a large barrow. Small
children, whose bodies do not carry the same impurity as those of their
elders and who are not full members of the Āryan community, are still often
buried, as are ascetics and members of some low castes in South India.

These customs have probably survived from very early days. In most
literary references the śmaśāna, or cremation ground, is described as
covered with putrefying corpses, and haunted by dogs and vultures, rather
than as the scene of cremation. The descriptions of such places show that
many people in ancient India did not cremate their dead, but, like the
Zoroastrians of Persia, merely abandoned their bodies to the wild beasts. No
doubt economic considerations played a big part in this practice, especially
in those parts of the country where timber was scarce; even to this day the
poorer Indians must be content with an exiguous funeral pyre, and their
corpses are often not completely burnt.



WOMEN
A woman, according to most authorities, was always a minor at law. As a
girl she was under the tutelage of her parents, as an adult, of her husband,
and as a widow, of her sons. Even under the liberal rules of Buddhism a
nun, however advanced in the faith, was always subordinate to the youngest
novice among the brethren. Early lawbooks assess a woman’s wergeld as
equivalent to that of a śūdra, whatever her class.

Most schools of law allowed a woman some personal property [Page
178] ( stridhana) in the form of jewellery and clothing. The Arthaśāstra
allowed her also to own money up to 2,000 silver panas, any sum above this
being held by her husband in trust on her behalf.41 The husband had certain
rights over his wife’s property; he might sell it in dire emergency, and he
might restrain her from giving it away wantonly, but for practical purposes
it was her own, and when she died it passed not to her husband or to her
sons, but to her daughters. Thus the property rights of women, limited
though they were, were greater than in many other early civilizations. In
fact women sometimes possessed more than was usually allowed to them
by the rules of stridhana. Jaina tradition mentions a potter-woman of the
town of Śrāvastī who owned a pottery with one hundred potter’s wheels.

Her status is nowhere mentioned, and it may be that she was thought of as a
widow, for we have seen that some legal schools allowed a widow to inherit
when there were no sons.

Women could at all times take up a life of religion, though of course they
could not officiate as priests. A few Vedic hymns are ascribed to women
seers, and among the voluminous Buddhist scriptures is a whole collection
of poems ascribed to the nuns of the early church, many of which are of
great literary merit (p. 456). The Brhadāraṇ yaka Upaniṣ ad 46 tells of a
learned lady, Gargi Vacaknavi, who attended the discussions of the sage
Yājñavalkya, and for a time so nonplussed him with her searching questions
that he could only jestingly reply, “Gargi, you mustn’t ask too much, or
your head will drop off!” References occur here and there in later texts to
girls occasionally attending the lectures of gurus, and mastering at least part
of the Vedas. By the time of the Smrtis, however, around the beginning of
the Christian era, Vedic knowledge was closed to women, although the
heterodox sects still catered for them. The tantric sects of the Middle Ages,
who worshipped feminine divinities, gave women an important place in
their cult and instituted orders of female ascetics.

In general, however, women were not encouraged to take up a life of
religion or asceticism. Their true function was marriage, and the care of
their menfolk and children. But the better class laywomen seem to have
been educated, and there are several references to works of Sanskrit poetry
and drama by women authors, of which some fragments survive. In Tamil
the early poetess Avvaiyar has left work of great merit, and a splendid
martial ode describing the great victory of the early Cōla king Karikalan at
Veṇṇi is ascribed to an unnamed potter’s wife. 47 The ladies of Sanskrit
courtly literature are often described as reading, writing, and composing
songs, and they seem to have been well versed in the arts of the time.

Though from [Page 179] medieval times until very recent years the arts of
music and dancing were looked on as quite unfit for respectable Indian
girls, and were practised only by low-caste women and prostitutes, this was
not the case in ancient days, when well-to-do girls were taught singing and
dancing, as well as other ladylike arts such as painting and garlandmaking.

In Muslim times the Hindus of Northern India adopted the system of
parda, by which, from puberty to old age, women were carefully screened
from the sight of all men but their husbands and close relatives. Though
such a system did not exist in ancient India the freedom accorded to married
women has been often exaggerated by authorities anxious to show that the
more objectionable aspects of later Hindu custom had no place in India’s
ancient culture. Certainly the Ṛ g Veda depicts young men and unmarried
girls mixing freely, and gives no evidence that married women were in any
way secluded, but this text belongs to a time which had long passed in the
great days of Hindu culture. Kings, at any rate, kept their womenfolk in
seclusion. The detailed instructions of the Arthaśāstra make it quite clear
that the antahpura, or royal harem, was closely guarded, and that its
inmates were not allowed to leave it freely. It was certainly not so strictly
secluded as in later Muslim communities, however, for early Arab travellers
remarked that queens were often to be seen in Hindu courts without veils,
and many other references show that, though screened from the general
public and carefully watched, the royal ladies were not completely
inaccessible, as in the Muslim system.

The women of the upper classes were kept at a distance from the opposite
sex. The Arthaśāstra, 37 in many ways more liberal than the religious
lawbooks, lays down quite stringent rules for the punishment of immodest
wives. A woman who insolently takes part in games, or drinks, against her
husband’s wishes, is to be fined three paṇas. If she leaves her home without
his permission to visit another woman she is to be fined six paṇas; if she
visits a man the fine is twelve; while if she goes on such errands by night
the fine is doubled. If she leaves the house while her husband is asleep or
drunk she is to be fined twelve paṇas. If a woman and a man make gestures
of sexual import to one another, or converse facetiously in secret, the
woman is to be fined twenty-four paṇas and the man twice that sum. If their
conversation takes place in a suspicious place, lashes may be substituted for
paṇas and “in the village square a caṇḍāla shall give her five lashes on
each side of the body”. Thus the husband had almost unlimited rights over
his wife’s movements.

Elsewhere the Arthaśāstra gives evidence of a different kind to show that
even in Mauryan times the freedom of high-class women [Page 180] was
considerably restricted by custom. In the instructions to the king’s
Superintendent of Weaving we are told that the staff of the royal weaving
and spinning establishments should be made up of indigent women-a
motley collection, including widows, cripples, orphans, beggar-women,
women who had failed to pay fines and were compelled to work them off,
and broken-down prostitutes. These were all of low class, and worked under
male overseers.48
It might happen that sometimes a better-class woman fell on evil days,
and was compelled to earn a living in this way. She was catered for,
however, in a different manner. If she could still maintain a maid, the maid
might fetch the yarn from the weaving shop, and bring it back in the form
of cloth; but if the lady was compelled to fetch and deliver her own material
stringent precautions were laid down so that her modesty should in no way
be offended. She was to go to the weaving shop in the dim light of dawn,
when she would not be easily seen. The official who received her work
should only use a lamp to examine its workmanship; if he looked her in the
face, or spoke to her about anything other than her work, he incurred the
fine known as “the first amercement”, from forty-eight to ninety paṇas. It is
evident from these instructions that upper-class women, though their faces
were unveiled, were not normally seen in public without their menfolk.

There were certainly wide differences of custom however. Girls of good
class and marriageable age are described in story as visiting temples and
taking part in festivals without guardian or chaperone. Early Tamil
literature, more popular in character than that of the Āryan North, makes
many references to the free association of young men and women. Early
sculpture gives the same impression. At Bharhut and Sānchū wealthy
ladies, naked to the waist, lean from their balconies to watch processions,
and scantily dressed women in the company of men worship the Bodhi
Tree, under which the Buddha gained enlightenment. We may conclude
that, while a woman’s freedom was generally much restricted, it was rarely
completely taken away.

A wife, however, had little initiative. Her first duty was to wait on her
husband, fetching and carrying for him, rubbing his feet when he was
weary, rising before him, and eating and sleeping after him.

“She should do nothing independently
even in her own house.

In childhood subject to her father,
in youth to her husband,
and when her husband is dead to her sons,
she should never enjoy independence….

[Page 181] “She should always be cheerful,
and skilful in her domestic duties,
with her household vessels well cleansed,
and her hand tight on the purse-strings….

“In season and out of season
her lord, who wed her with sacred rites,
ever gives happiness to his wife,
both here and in the other world.

“Though he be uncouth and prone to pleasure,
though he have no good points at all,
the virtuous wife should ever
worship her lord as a god.”49
Passages of this type are frequent in literature of a religious and semi-
religious type, and stories of obedient and faithful wives are numerous. The
great models of Indian womanhood are Sita, who faithfully followed her
husband Rama into exile and endured great hardships and temptations for
his sake (p. 412f), and Savitrl, who, like the Greek Alcestis, followed her
husband Satyavant when he was being carried away by the death-god
Yama, and so impressed the god with her loyalty that he released her lord.

A medieval tale gives an even more striking example of wifely fidelity:
A woman was holding her sleeping husband’s head in her lap, as
they and their child warmed themselves in winter before a blazing fire.

Suddenly the child crawled towards the fire, but the woman made no
attempt to save it from the flames, since thus she would wake her lord.

As the baby crawled further into the flames she prayed to the fire-god
Agni not to hurt him. The god, impressed by her obedience, granted
her prayer, and the child sat smiling and unharmed in the middle of the
fire until the man awoke.50
Though the early Indian mind, prone to exaggeration, perhaps overdid
the necessity of wifely obedience, her status was not without honour.

“The wife is half the man,
the best of friends,
the root of the three ends of life,
and of all that will help him in the other world.

“With a wife a man does mighty deeds…
With a wife a man finds courage.

A wife is the safest refuge….

[Page 182] “A man aflame with sorrow in his soul,
or sick with disease, finds comfort in his wife,
as a man parched with heat
finds relief in water.

“Even a man in the grip of rage
will not be harsh to a woman,
remembering that on her depend
the joys of love, happiness, and virtue.

“For woman is the everlasting field,
in which the Self is born.” 51
Passages like these, showing the honour and esteem in which women were
held, are quite as numerous as those which stress their subservience.

Everywhere it is stated that a woman should be lovingly cherished, well fed
and cared for, and provided with jewellery and luxuries to the limits of her
husband’s means. She should never be upbraided too severely, for the gods
will not accept the sacrifice of the man who beats his wife. The ancient
Indian attitude to women was in fact ambivalent. She was at once a goddess
and a slave, a saint and a strumpet.

The latter aspect of her character is frequently brought out in
semireligious and gnomic literature. Women’s lust knows no bounds:
“The fire has never too many logs,
the ocean never too many rivers,
death never too many living souls,
and fair-eyed woman never too many men.”52
No one man can satisfy a libidinous woman’s cravings; unless constantly
watched she will consort with every stranger, even with a hunchback, a
dwarf or a cripple (p. 443), and in the last resort will have recourse to
Lesbian practices with members of her own sex. Her deception is as all-
embracing as her lust, and she is incorrigibly fickle.

Moreover, women are quarrelsome and given to pique. They quarrel with
one another, with their parents, and with their husbands. The henpecked
husband, as we show elsewhere (p. 459f), was wellknown in ancient India.

Many verses in medieval anthologies depict the emotion of māna, an
untranslatable word implying a mixture of anger, wounded pride and
jealousy. Early Tamil literature contains a whole class of poems describing
the efforts of the husband to calm his wife’s anger, roused by his attentions
to a rival, usually a prostitute. If Sita, the heroine of the Rāmāyaṇ a, is
invariably meek and [Page 183] compliant before her lord, Draupadī of the
Mahābhārata can round on her five husbands and reproach them in no
uncertain terms. The Mauryan kings were guarded by amazons trained in
the use of sword and bow, and the Greeks were impressed by the ferocity
with which the women of some of the Panjāb tribes aided their menfolk in
resisting Alexander. In later times women sometimes took part in war (p.

91), and the tradition was continued among the Rajputs until quite recently;
there are numerous records of masterly and warlike widows resisting the
enemies of their husbands-the last being the famous Rānā of Jhānsū, whose
part in the Indian Mutiny has made her a national heroine of modern India.



PROSTITUTION
Ancient India contained one class of women who were not bound by the
rules and restrictions which limited the freedom of the highcaste wife.

These were the prostitutes ( veśyā, gaṇ ikā). There were certainly many poor
and cheap prostitutes, who would end their days in beggary, or as menials
and work-women; but the typical prostitute of literature was beautiful,
accomplished, and wealthy, enjoying a position of fame and honour
comparable to that of the Aspasias and Phrynes of classical Greece.

As in Greece the higher class hetaira was an educated woman. The
authorities on erotics demand that, as well as in the art immediately
essential to her profession, she should be thoroughly trained in “the sixty-
four arts”. These were a stock list, which included not only music, dancing
and singing, but also acting, the composition of poetry, impromptu and
otherwise, flower-arrangement and garland-making, the preparation of
perfumes and cosmetics, cooking, dress-making and embroidery, sorcery,
conjuring and sleight of hand, the composition of riddles, tongue-twisters
and other puzzles, fencing with sword and staff, archery, gymnastics,
carpentry and architecture, logic, chemistry and mineralogy, gardening,
training fighting cocks, partridges and rams, teaching parrots and mynahs to
talk, writing in cipher, languages, making artificial flowers, and clay
modelling.

It is hardly likely that the prostitute did in fact study all the arts of this
rather bizarre list, but it shows what was expected of her. If she mastered
those arts most suited to her profession a brilliant future awaited her. “A
courtesan of a pleasant disposition, beautiful, and otherwise attractive, who
has mastered the arts… has the right to a seat of honour among men. She
will be honoured by the king and praised by the learned, and all will seek
her favours and treat her [Page 184] with consideration.”53 The literature of
the Middle Ages fully bears out this statement.

Typical of such accomplished courtesans was Ambapālī, the hetaira of
Vaiśālū, famous in Buddhist legend. Much that is said of this lady is
certainly legendary, but it gives a significant indication of the status of the
better type of courtesan in ancient India. Ambapall was immensely wealthy,
highly intelligent, and famous throughout the civilized portion of India. She
was one of the most treasured possessions of her city, and mixed on equal
terms with princes. On his last journey to the Hills, as he passed through
Vaisali, the Buddha accepted her invitation to dine in preference to that of
the city fathers, who wished to give him a civic reception. Ambapālī is said
to have become a Buddhist nun, and one of the most beautiful poems of the
Pali canon is attributed to her (p. 456).

The prostitute was protected and supervised by the state. The
Arthaśāstra54 suggests the appointment of a Superintendent of Prostitutes
who should be responsible for the care and supervision of the palace
courtesans, the inspection of brothels, and the collection of two days’
earnings from each prostitute every month, as tax to the government.

Teachers and trainers of prostitutes were to be given encouragement by the
state. As in all other societies, around the prostitute congregated men of
doubtful character, either outside the law or on its borderline-thieves,
rogues, pseudo-magicians, and confidence tricksters of all kinds. The texts
on statecraft recommend that for this reason special watch should be kept
on brothels and that prostitutes should be enlisted in the secret service. This
fact was noted by Megasthenes, who remarked that the spies did much of
their work with the help of prostitutes. From the example of the play “The
Little Clay Cart” it would seem that a prostitute might become an honest
woman by marriage, for here the heroine, the high-souled courtesan
Vasantasena, ultimately becomes the second wife of the brāhmaṇ hero
Carudatta.

The position of the courtesan merged with that of the concubine. Kings
and chiefs retained numerous prostitutes in their palaces, who were salaried
servants, and who often had other duties to perform, such as attending on
the king’s person. The status of these women is somewhat obscure, but
apparently they were not only at the service of the king, but also of any
courtier on whom he might choose temporarily to bestow them, and thus
they were not on a par with the regular inhabitants of his harem. Prostitutes
of this type accompanied the king wherever he went, and even awaited him
in the rear when he went into battle.


Another type of prostitute pursued her trade in an odour of [Page 185]
sanctity. In the Middle Ages the god in his temple was treated like an
earthly king; he had his wives, his ministers and attendants, and all the
paraphernalia of a court-including his attendant prostitutes. These were
often the children of mothers of the same profession, born and reared in the
temple precincts, but they might be daughters of ordinary citizens, given in
childhood to the god as pious offerings. They attended on the god’s person,
danced and sang before him, and, like the servants of an earthly king,
bestowed their favours on the courtiers whom he favoured, in this case the
male worshippers who paid their fee to the temple.

PLATE XLIV
We have no evidence of temple prostitution in very early times, though it
certainly existed in other ancient civilizations, and it has been suggested,
without valid evidence in our opinion, that it was known in the prehistoric
Indus cities (p. 21). The earliest record of religious prostitution comes from
a cave at Ramgarh, in the Vindhya hills some 160 miles south of Banaras,
which contains two significant Prakrit inscriptions in a script which shows
that they were written not long after the days of Aśoka. The first of these is
in verse:
“Poets, the leaders of lovers,
light up the hearts which are heavy with passion.

She who rides on a seesaw, the object of jest and blame,
how can she have fallen so deep in love as this?”
And then, in prose:
“The excellent young man Devadinna the painter loved Sutanuka, the
slave-girl of the god.” 55
The enamoured Sutanuka is referred to by the word later regularly used
for a temple prostitute— devadasi—and was evidently something of the
kind herself. There are no other clear references to devadāsīs in early
sources, however, and we must assume that they were rare until the Middle
Ages. Temple prostitution was most common in the South, where it
survived until recent times. The wild fertility cults of the early Tamils
involved orgiastic dancing, and their earliest literature shows that
prostitution was common among them; thus religious prostitution came
naturally to the Dravidian. Many inscriptions and charters of the medieval
South commemorating donations to temples refer specially to devadāsīs; for
instance a general of Vikramaditya VI Cālukya, named Mahādeva, is
recorded as founding a temple in memory of his late mother, with quarters
for the most beautiful temple-prostitutes in the country. 56 In his eyes, and in
those of his contemporaries, there was no incongruity in such a memorial.

Prostitution, though in many contexts honoured and respected, [Page
186] was much disapproved of by the Smrti writers, whose works contain
passages of warning against the evils of prostitution reminiscent of those in
the Jewish Book of Proverbs. Manu and some other texts class the harlot
and gambler with the thief and blackmailer, and declare that brāhmaṇs must
never consort with prostitutes, on pain of very heavy penances. One source
even maintains that the murderer of a prostitute commits no sin and should
incur no punishment at law. 57 But, as we have noticed in many other cases,
the secular attitude differed very greatly from the religious ideal, and here it
was the secular view which prevailed. By the Middle Ages the brāhmaṇs
who propounded the. Sacred Law might themselves be attached to temples
with hundreds of prostitutes on their staffs.



WIDOWS
In general a widow could not remarry. By medieval times this rule was
applied so strictly in the upper classes that it included even girls widowed in
childhood, whose marriages had not been consummated. Even the custom
of niyoga, which gave the childless widow a chance to conceive a son by
her brother-in-law (p. 175), passed into desuetude in the early centuries of
the Christian era.

All evidence shows, however, that the remarriage of widows was fairly
common in earlier times. The Arthaśāstra admits its possibility. In the
famous old story of Nala and Damayanti, the hero, who has long been
parted from his wife, is reunited with her by the subterfuge of her
announcement that she presumes his death and plans to hold a second
svayaṃvara. One or two minor authorities admit the possibility of a
woman’s remarriage if her husband disappears, dies, becomes an ascetic, is
impotent, or loses caste;58 but later commentators explain away these
awkward references by the easy fiction of kalivarjya (p. 148), and all agree
with Manu: ‘nowhere is a second husband permitted to respectable
women”.59 Thus the practice of widow remarriage, together with many
other healthy old customs, gradually disappeared among the higher classes.

In those families which adhered to the letter of the law the lot of the
widow was very hard. She was to all intents and purposes an ascetic,
sleeping on the ground, and eating only one simple meal a day, without
honey, meat, wine or salt, wearing no ornaments or coloured garments, and
using no perfumes. In medieval times widows were also expected to shave
their hair. The widow had to maintain this austere regimen to the end of her
days, in the hope of being remarried to her former husband in the next life;
her time was spent in prayer and other religious rites on his behalf, and any
breach [Page 187] of her ascetic discipline not only made her liable to a
very unhappy rebirth, but also endangered the welfare of the soul of her
departed husband, who might suffer in the after-life for the shortcomings of
his other half on earth.

Moreover a widow was inauspicious to everyone but her own children.

Wherever she went her presence cast a gloom on all about her. She could
never attend the family festivals which played so big a part in Hindu life,
for she would bring bad luck on all present. She was still a member of her
husband’s family, and could not return to that of her parents. Always
watched by the parents and relatives of her lord, lest she broke her vows
and imperilled the dead man’s spiritual welfare, shunned as unlucky even
by the servants, her life must often have been miserable in the extreme.

In these circumstances it is not surprising that women often immolated
themselves on their husbands’ funeral pyres, a practice noticed with much
disapprobation by European travellers and only put down in the last
century. The word sati (written suttee by older English writers) means “a
virtuous woman”, and the word was erroneously applied by early officials
and missionaries to the satī’s self-immolation.

The history of the custom takes us back to the earliest cultures. Many
ancient peoples buried or burnt a man’s widows, horses, and other cherished
possessions with his corpse, in order that he might have all that he loved
and needed in the other world. We know that such practices were followed
by the kings of Ur, and also by the ancient Chinese and some early Indo-
European peoples. One of the funeral hymns of the Ṛ g Veda shows that in
the earliest form of the cremation rite known to us the widow lay down
beside the dead man, and his bow was placed in his hand; the bow was
removed, and the wife called on to return to the land of the living. 60 This
practice must look back to a time long before the composition of the hymn,
when the wife was actually burnt with her husband.

The earliest datable notice of the self-immolation of the sati occurs in
Greek accounts of Alexander’s invasion. One or two cases are mentioned in
the Epics, but rarely enough to show that the custom was uncommon at the
time of their composition. Early Smrti literature allows it, but in general
does not strongly emphasise it. The first memorial of a sati is found at Eran,
near Saugor in Madhya Pradesh, where a brief inscription engraved on a
pillar in A.D. 510 records the tragic passing of a hero and his wife in short
verses of un-Indian simplicity, which suggest the epitaphs of the Greek
Anthology:
[Page 188] “Hither came Bhānu Gupta, the bravest man on earth,
a great king, a hero bold as Arjuna;
and hither Goparaja followed him,
as a friend follows a friend.

“And he fought a great and a famous battle,
and passed to heaven, a god among chieftains.

His wife, loyal and loving, beloved and fair,
followed close behind him into the flames.” 61
It is known that the nomads of Central Asia practised this custom, and it
may have received some stimulus from their invasions. In any case, from
this time onwards it became more common, and there are numerous satī-
stones all over India, commemorating the many faithful wives who
followed their slain lords in death.

Criticisms of the custom were not unknown. It was condemned by the
humane poet Bana, in the 7th century, and by the tantric sects, which even
declared that the woman burning herself on her husband’s pyre went
straight to hell. But some medieval writers roundly declare that the satī, by
her self-immolation, expunges both her own and her husband’s sins, and
that the two enjoy together 35 million years of bliss in heaven.

The living cremation of the sati was always in theory voluntary, but, if
we are to judge from later analogy, social and family pressure may have
made it virtually obligatory on some high-caste widows, especially those of
the warrior class. The 15th-century traveller Nicolo dei Conti states that as
many as three thousand of the wives and concubines of the kings of
Vijayanagara were pledged to be burnt with their lord on his death. 6
The widow was, as we have seen, an inauspicious encumbrance to her
husband’s family, and might seriously endanger the welfare of his soul by
the least breach of her vows. In a polygamous household the objection to
widows would be correspondingly multiplied. The widow herself, if she
had no young children, might well prefer even a painful death, in the hope
of reunion with her husband, to a dreary life of hunger, scorn, and domestic
servitude. It is thus not surprising that satīs were so common in medieval
Hindu society.

1 In later texts the term “twice-born” was often reserved for brahmans,
but strictly it applies to ksatriyas and vaisyas also if they have been
initiated.

2 This term was extended to mean a family priest, who performed the
many rites and ceremonies of Hinduism for a family or group of families,
and has survived in this sense to the present day.

3 This is the Pali form; the Sanskrit is paulkasa.

4 Compare also the Buddhist legend of Vessantara (p. 287).

5 The secular Kamasutra even advises the postponement of
consummation for ten days (below, p. 172).

6 South Indian kings were often accompanied in death not only by their
wives, but also by their ministers and palace servants. There are also
numerous records of royal officers giving their lives in sacrifice to a god for
the prosperity of a king and his kingdom.



VI.

EVERYDAY LIFE: THE DAILY ROUND IN
CITY AND VILLAGE


THE VILLAGE
[Page 189]
WE have no certain means of assessing the population of ancient India,
since the detailed registers which were kept in many kingdoms have long
since vanished. One authority has suggested that during the medieval period
the total population of the Sub-continent was between 100 and 140
millions, 1 a figure which seems reasonable, although based on very slender
evidence. But whatever India’s population in ancient and medieval times, it
was certainly mainly rural. At the present day it is said that 85 per cent of
India’s total population dwell in villages, and we may be sure that the
proportion in the past was no less, but probably more. The average man in
ancient India was a countryman.


Fig. xii.-A village (from a relief at Amarāvatī. c. 2nd century A.D.)

No one who has travelled from Delhi to Calcutta by train could fail to be
impressed by the monotony of the great Gangetic Plain. The shabby little
villages, often very close together, are punctuated only by rivers and canals.

They have a few trees on their outskirts, [Page 190] and here and there a
small grove divides one from another. Otherwise there is nothing to be seen
between the villages but little fields separated by narrow footpaths and
occasional rough roads. But this was not the case in ancient times.

Even when the first Englishmen set up their trading stations in Madras,
Bombay and Calcutta there were more trees in the countryside; and in the
earlier period India was much better afforested. Hsüan Tsang’s account of
India shows that, in the 7th century, dense jungle lined the banks of the
Ganges for many miles on end. The countryside was wilder than it is today.

The tiger, now rare except in certain districts, roamed the length and
breadth of the land. In the West the lion, now almost extinct, was common.

Herds of wild elephants, carefully preserved by kings, were numerous in
regions where they are now unknown. The foothills of the Vindhyas and the
Ghats, now in many places almost denuded of larger trees by centuries of
woodcutting and many generations of browsing goats, were richly forested.

In fact the age-old agricultural techniques of India had not yet exhausted
her soil, and her peasants had not yet torn up her forests, though in some
places, notably Magadha (South Bihār) and parts of the Tamil country, this
process was almost complete by the Middle Ages, if not before.

The Indian village differed very little from that of the present day, but
while most villages in the North are now open and undefended, in earlier
times they were usually walled or stockaded, as they are still in many parts
of the Deccan. The village was a cluster of huts, small and large, often
grouped round a well or a pond, near which was a small open space with a
few trees. In earlier times villages often had clubrooms, which served as
rest-houses for travellers and as centres of social life; later the place of these
halls was taken by the village temples. The villagers formed a self-
conscious community, and often had an energetic communal life. We quote
from a Jātaka story.

“One day they stood in the middle of the village to transact village
business, and they. … [decided to] do good works; so they would get
up betimes, and go out with knives, axes and crowbars. With their
crowbars they rolled away the stones on the four highways; they cut
down the trees which caught the axles of their carts; they levelled the
irregularities [of the roads]; they built an embankment and dug tanks;

they made a village hall; they showed charity and kept the [Buddhist]
commandments.”2
This vigorous corporate life continued into the Middle Ages. Tamil
inscriptions show that the village councils (p. 106) took an active interest in
the communal welfare, dug and renewed reservoirs, made [Page 191]
canals, improved the roads, and cared for the village shrines. This strong
sense of the community was one of the chief factors in the survival of
Hindu Culture.

Most of the villagers were free peasants, and their land was to all intents
and purposes their own, though the king claimed its ultimate ownership (p.

109f). The lot of the peasant was hard, though perhaps poverty was not so
grinding as it later became, and agricultural indebtedness was certainly less
heavy. Most peasant holdings were small, and were usually worked by the
owner and his family; but there were a few large farmsteads, the owners of
which cultivated their estates with hired labour. Kings too had large
demesnes, worked by serfs and labourers, who in Mauryan times received
one and one quarter paṇa per month with maintenance. 3 Other land was let
out by the owners to share-croppers in return for one half of the crop.


Fig. xiii.-Country scene (from a terracotta plaque found at Bhītā, near Allahabad.? 1st century
B.C.)


These landless labourers existed in the Indian village at least from
Mauryan times, and probably earlier, their state an unhappy and despised
one. Illness, famine, idleness, or some other cause would sometimes compel
a peasant to sell his holding, or result in his eviction for non-payment of
tax, and he would be reduced to shame and penury as a casual labourer. But
this process, whereby land tended to become concentrated in the hands of a
few landowners, was more than counteracted by the Indian joint family
system. On the death of the head of the house there was usually a partition
of the family lands, and thus a few generations might see the break-up of a
large [Page 192] estate. A real class of squires or large farmers never
appeared in Hindu India.

To heavy taxation, forced labour, and the visitations of the king and his
officers, were added periodical dearths and famines to afflict and
impoverish the peasant. Though Megasthenes declared that famine was
unknown in India, he certainly wrote in this particular from inadequate
knowledge. References to famine, with its attendant horrors, are fairly
common in ancient Indian literature (p. 443). Indeed a great famine is said
to have occurred not long after Megasthenes left India, at the end of the
reign of Candragupta Maurya. The more energetic and conscientious kings
did what they could to prevent and relieve famine. The Arthaśāstra even
suggests that a king is justified in confiscating the hoarded wealth of his
subjects to feed the hungry. The state granaries would be opened in
emergency, and the charity of religious establishments and private persons
was no doubt of some help; but with such poor communications famine was
even more severe than it is now. There is reason to believe that rainfall was
rather heavier than in recent years, and the pressure of population on the
means of subsistence was not as great as it has now become. Hence
outbreaks of dearth and famine were probably less frequent in ancient days,
but when they did occur they caused even greater hardship and loss of life.

Throughout our period there was a gradual expansion of cultivation as a
result of pressure on the land. The Arthaśāstra4 suggests a positive policy
of colonization, clearing of waste, and development of new villages, while
the Jataka stories show us groups of hardy peasants from overpopulated
villages cutting new settlements from the jungle, and even tell of whole
villages emigrating en masse to the wilds to escape the attentions of
extortionate tax-collectors.

In the flat plains the land was cut by canals running from the great rivers,
and dotted with artificial reservoirs (usually referred to in Anglo-Indian
jargon as “tanks”), which were made by damming smaller streams or
enlarging lakes by stopping their outlets. From these water-supplies,
whether natural or artificial, water was raised by counterpoised “sweeps”,
and fed into smaller channels which watered the fields. The “Persian
wheel”, turned by an ox, is nowhere clearly mentioned in early sources,
though it may have been used.

Irrigation works, often of enormous size, were undertaken by beneficent
kings as a religious and social duty. The most famous of these reservoirs
was that of Girnar, the history of which has come down to us, thanks to two
inscriptions on the site (pp. 62, 104). We do not know when the great
embankment, over 100 feet thick at the base, finally crumbled. Probably the
largest achievement of Indian [Page 193] irrigation until recent years was
the lake at Bhojpur, near Bhopal, built in the middle of the 11th century by
Bhoja Paramara, the king of Dhara. This too has vanished; the embankment
was breached by the Muslims in the 15th century, and has never been
restored; but it is evident from those traces which remain that the lake
originally covered no less than 250 square miles.5 In the extreme north of
India we read of Suyya, a great engineer in the service of king
Avantivarman of Kashmīr (9th century), who “made the streams of Indus
and Jhelam flow according to his will, like a snake-charmer his snakes”. In
the south, at the end of our period, Paes saw the building of a mighty tank at
Vijayanagara, the embankment of which, he says, was a crossbow-shot
wide. The first efforts at its construction were unsuccessful, so King Kṛṣṇa
Deva Raya ordered a great human sacrifice of prisoners to appease the
gods, and finished the work with the labour of 20,000 men.

Most of the larger irrigation works of Hindu India have now vanished,
but in Ceylon ancient reservoirs of enormous size still exist (pl. III a),
though the canal systems which they served have largely disappeared, and
are only now being repaired. After many centuries of neglect, recent
governments, both in India and Ceylon, have begun to redevelop the
irrigation systems without which tropical agriculture cannot flourish, and
which were among the first concerns of kings of ancient times.



AGRICULTURE AND STOCKBREEDING
The staple corn crops of ancient India were, as they are today, wheat and
barley in the cool north and elsewhere as winter crops, rice in the irrigated
plains, and millet in the dryer lands, such as parts of the Deccan Plateau,
where rice would not grow. Among other crops sugar cane was widely
grown, and sugar exported to Europe, while leaf vegetables and gourds of
various kinds were grown nearly everywhere, as was the sesamum, much
valued for its edible oil. Numerous types of peas, beans and lentils were
grown everywhere. South India, especially Keraḻa (Malabar), grew many
spices, particularly pepper, cardamom, ginger and cinnamon, which were
carried all over India and exported to Europe. The Himalayan foothills
produced the precious saffron. Cotton was at all times the staple textile
crop.

Of fruits pride of place was taken by the mango, which was grown in
orchards and much valued. The small Indian banana, or plantain, was also
grown in damper parts of the land. The coconut was a comparatively late
importation from S.-E. Asia, and is not mentioned [Page 194] in early
sources, though it was known in the Middle Ages. In the coastal areas were
grown the palmyra and talipot palms, which provided India’s chief writing
material, and also the alcoholic drinks now known as toddy and arrack.

Another valued palm was the areca, whose hard, slightly narcotic nut,
broken up, mixed with lime and other ingredients, and wrapped in the leaf
of the betel vine, formed the tāmbūla, or chewing quid, which was
introduced into Northern India from the South early in the Christian era,
and has ever since been a most popular source of post-prandial solace to the
Indian. The date palm was grown in the dryer regions of the West, but is
little mentioned in literature. The sour fruit of the tamarind was much used
to flavour curry. The grape, introduced from Persia with the almond and
walnut, was cultivated in the Western Himalayas. Sandal and other trees
provided much-prized fragrant woods; these trees mostly grew in the South.

The Greek travellers were most impressed by the fertility of India’s soil
and the energy and ability of her cultivators. The modern traveller’s
impressions are diametrically opposite, but the Greeks judged Indian
agriculture by standards lower than ours, and the soil was less exhausted
then than now. The Greeks found it a great source of wonder that India
produced two crops a year. In the wetter parts of the land the two crops
might even grow without irrigation, while in the plains a summer crop of
rice would grow during the monsoon, and a second irrigated crop in the dry
season.

Ancient India knew the use of manure, and the Arthaśāstra lays down
several rules for the management of the king’s farms which indicate a well-
developed agricultural technique. The Indian peasant of today is so
conservative in his methods that we may assume that the ordinary villagers
of ancient days cultivated the land much as they do now, ploughing with
shallow wooden ploughs drawn by oxen, harvesting with sickles, threshing
with oxen, and winnowing by tossing their corn in the wind. Iron
ploughshares were certainly known, however, for they are mentioned in
literature.

The basic livestock of the peasant was cattle, used for ploughing,
transport and food. Villages employed a communal cowherd, who drove the
cattle, branded with their owners’ marks, to the waste beyond the ploughed
fields every morning, and returned with them at dusk. We have no means of
comparing the yield of the cattle of ancient days with that of their scraggy
modern counterparts, but as there was more pasture and waste it may have
been better. Milk and curd were important articles of diet, as was ghee
( ghrta), made from melted butter by skimming off the solid fat, and leaving
only the liquid butter-oil, which would keep indefinitely in a hot climate.

[Page 195] The inviolability of the cow was of slow growth. Though
there seems to have been some feeling against the killing of cows even in
Vedic times, Asoka did not forbid the slaughter of cattle, and oxen, at any
rate, were killed for food even later. But the Arthaśāstra refers to the
existence of herds of aged, diseased and sterile cattle, 6 and it therefore
appears that before the Christian era cattle were normally allowed to die a
natural death, at least in some parts of the country. The same work suggests
that those who kill cattle should be put to death, but from the context it is
clear that this prescription applies only to killers of cattle stolen from the
royal herds.

As well as cattle owned by cultivating peasants there were large herds
belonging to professional herdsmen, who led a semi-nomadic life in the
wilder parts of the country. One important tribe of these people, the
Abhiras, which dwelt in widely scattered localities of South Rajasthan,
Malwa and Sind around the beginning of the Christian era, was perhaps
responsible for the development of the cult of Kṛṣṇa in his pastoral aspect,
and Abhira chiefs set up a short-lived kingdom in the N.-W. Deccan on the
ruins of the Sātavahānas.

Other domestic animals included the buffalo, second only to the ox as a
beast of burden, and the favourite victim of sacrifices to the goddess Durga,
whose cult became very popular in the Middle Ages. The goat was bred
widely, as was the sheep in the cooler districts. The fine goats’ wool fabric
of Kashmīr was known and used widely in Northern India, and heavier
sheep’s and yaks’ wool blankets were exported in small quantities from the
hills to the Northern Plains, where the winter nights are usually cold enough
to make their comfort pleasant. The domestic pig was also known, though it
did not play a very important part in rural economy.

Horses were bred chiefly in Sind and the North-West. They would not
breed well in the Deccan, and were regularly imported by sea from Sind,
Persia and Arabia to the ports of Western India. The horse was always a
luxury animal, used chiefly by the warrior class. For the ordinary people the
chief means of conveyance was the ox, of which certain varieties could
draw carts at a considerable pace. The kings of Vijayanagara delighted in
watching races of light carts to which an ox and a horse were yoked.

The elephant was certainly tamed by the time of the Buddha. It rarely
breeds in captivity, and therefore it had to be hunted and captured alive.

Special forest tracts were designated as elephant preserves, inhabited by
trackers, hunters and tamers, in the employ of the king. Generally the
ownership of elephants was confined to kings and chiefs, and peasants
living in the vicinity of elephant [Page 196] forests must have cursed the
depredations of these beasts, which would frequently leave the jungle to
raid the clearings.

The camel is not often mentioned, but it was certainly known and used as
a beast of burden in the dryer parts of the country, and by the Middle Ages
was also found in the Deccan. Some medieval dynasties employed the
camel in war. The mule and the ass were other common beasts of burden.

The half-wild pariah dog was as common in early India as it is today, and
dogs were also used in hunting. In the hills a special breed of large dog,
perhaps resembling the modern Tibetan mastiff, was famous beyond the
bounds of India. The Persian emperor Artaxerxes I (465–424 B.C.) is said by
Herodotus to have exempted the inhabitants of four Babylonian villages
from taxation in return for their breeding Indian dogs for war and hunting.

These dogs were also known in the Egypt of the Ptolemies. The dog is only
once mentioned with respect and affection in Indian literature, and was
rarely if ever treated as a pet. The exception occurs in the Mahābhārata,
where the five Pandava brothers and their wife Draupadi take their dog with
them on their final pilgrimage to heaven, and the eldest brother Yudhisthira
refuses to enter without his faithful friend. It has been suggested that the
episode shows Iranian influence, for with the Zoroastrians the dog was a
sacred animal. The domestic cat is rarely mentioned.

The hunting leopard or cheetah ( citraka) is only referred to as a wild
beast until the Middle Ages, and similarly the hawk was not tamed in early
times. Hawking and hunting with cheetahs did not become popular among
the ruling classes until the 11th century, and the custom may have been
learnt from the Muslims.

The fowl was known, though eggs played but a small part in the diet of
early India. The peacock, in earlier times, was certainly used as food, and
was the favourite dish of the emperor Aśoka, 7 until he adopted a vegetarian
diet. We read of whole villages of peacockrearers, who supplied their birds
to kings and wealthy people, at first largely for food, but later chiefly for
ornament. Several other ornamental fowl, especially the ruddy sheldrake or
brahmany duck ( cakravāka) were kept in the parks of the rich, and parrots
and mynahs were very popular as pets, especially with ladies, who are
referred to as devoting long hours to teaching the birds to talk.

Silkworms were bred and reared, chiefly in Bengal and Assam. It has
been suggested by some that silk was known even in Vedic times, and silk-
making moths were certainly indigenous to India; but it is probable that silk
was first introduced to India from China by way of the Burma Road, in the
second half of the 1st millennium B.C. The [Page 197] earliest certain
references to silk are found in the Buddhist scriptures, and in the
Arthaśāstra, where it is called cinapatta, “the Chinese cloth”. In the 2nd

century B.C. the Chinese traveller Chang K’ien found that Chinese silk was
imported into Bactria by way of India, and this suggests that even at this
time the Indians had not yet fully mastered the art of spinning and weaving
fine silks, which they certainly did later. Besides the silkworm another
insect of commercial importance was the lac-insect, which provides both
the resin used for shellac (and in India for articles of ornament), and also
the dye known as “lake-dye.”

THE WILD TRIBES
In the Himalayan foothills and the remoter parts of the Vindhyas and the
Deccan wild tribes still exist. Most of them are now partly civilized and
Hinduized, but some, though happy folk, knit together by tribal custom into
solid, self-supporting and self-sufficient communities, still preserve vestiges
of ferocious and barbaric tradition. The Gonds of the Eastern Deccan
offered human sacrifices at their fertility ceremonies until well into the last
century, the victims often being unfortunate villagers kidnapped from the
more civilized settlements, while head-hunting among the Nagas of Assam
is even now not completely stamped out.

At one time, of course, practically the whole of India was inhabited by
such peoples, and in ancient and medieval times they were more numerous
and occupied a wider area than at present. From the earliest invasions they
waged a losing battle against the advancing culture of the Āryans, and at all
times they were a source of danger to the outposts of civilization in the
vicinity of their lands. The brief statement of Asoka’s policy towards the
forest tribes (p. 53f) throws a flood of light on the ruthless policy of earlier
kings towards them. Many primitive peoples were exterminated and many
more lost their identity in the course of the growth of Hindu civilization; but
some accepted the suzerainty of their civilized overlords, and retained their
ancestral lands. The Arthaśāstra mentions such people as useful in time of
war. Many of these tribes came more and more under the influence of
Āryan ways, and their tribal cults were roughly assimilated to Hinduism by
wandering brāhmaṇs. Such tribes were undoubtedly the ancestors of many
lower Hindu castes of later times. Some primitive tribes may well have
learnt enough from the Āryans to become powerful, and it has been
reasonably suggested that more than one important medieval dynasty
originated in such a way.

At all times, however, uncivilized tribal peoples continued to exist [Page
198] in the outlying districts in virtual independence, perhaps occasionally
paying tribute in kind to the representative of their overlord. The last great
king of Hindu India, Krsna Deva Raya of Vijayanagara, mentioned them in
a brief textbook on government in Telugu, the Āmuktamālyada. When the
forest folk multiplied in the kingdom, he wrote, they caused no little trouble
to the king and his subjects; but, like Asoka, he advocated fair and honest
treatment towards them. “If the king grows angry with them, he cannot
wholly destroy them, but if he wins their affection by kindness and charity
they serve him by invading the enemy’s territory and plundering his forts.”8
At all times the wild tribesmen were a danger to the settled villagers in
the outlying parts of the country. In medieval literature, both in Sanskrit and
the Dravidian vernaculars, are references to these wild raiders pillaging
crops and herds and houses, and capturing victims for human sacrifice. The
area of their operations was gradually pushed back, and as more and more
primitive tribes were assimilated to the Hindu order they became gradually
less dangerous; but throughout the period covered by this book they were a
source of fear in many parts of India, the bogey men with which mothers
frightened their naughty children. No doubt many of the characteristics of
the demons and malevolent spirits of Hindu mythology, Nagas, YaKṛṣṇas,
Raksasas and the like, were acquired from the wild tribes (p. 317f).



THE TOWN
By the time of the Buddha, there were small towns all over North India,
and some, such as Kasi (Banaras) and Kauśāmbī, had an antiquity of
centuries; but even at this time large cities were few. According to an
ancient Buddhist tradition, at the time of the Buddha’s “Great Decease” the
disciple Ananda said that he regretted that his master was to die in so small
a town as Kuśinagara, and mentioned the six cities which he considered
important enough for a Buddha to die in: Śrāvastī, Campā, Rājagrha, Sāketa
(later generally known as Ayodhyā), Kauśāmbī, and Kāśī. These were
evidently the greatest cities of the 5th century B.C., but their sites are still not
wholly excavated, and we have no good means of judging their size, except
in the case of one of them. This is Rajagrha, the walls of which still remain,
and show that the fortified area had a perimeter of twenty-five miles. The
whole area was not built upon, but Rajagrha was a garden city, with a
central core, and houses in the suburbs surrounded by extensive parks and
fields.

Pataliputra in the time of the Mauryas, according to Megasthenes, [Page
199] was a long narrow city, stretching nine miles along the bank of the
Ganges, and reaching only one and a half miles inland. It was no doubt
mainly built-up, unlike Rajagrha, which covered a larger area but must have
had a smaller population. At the end of our period Paes states that
Vijayanagara was larger and more populous than Rome and contained
100,000 houses, from which we may infer that its population was at least
half a million, and probably more.

At the time of writing several small excavations have been made at
various Indian city sites, but only one such site, and that not representative,
has been excavated sufficiently to reveal the plan of the city. This is
Taksasila, where two cities have been discovered, one dating from the time
of the Achæmenid kings of Persia and the other from the Greco-Bactrian
period. Both were built on either side of a broad main street, and the larger
houses of both had central courtyards, in the manner traditional in India
from the days of the Harappā Culture; but in other respects the two were

very different. The first city, known to archæologists as Bhir Mound, shows
no trace of town planning; on the irregular and crooked main street opened
a maze of narrow alleys, ramifying in all directions at the whim of many
private builders. The second city, known as Sirkap, had a fine main street
some twenty feet wide, running due north and south, with lesser [Page 200]
roads running off it at right angles and at regular intervals; it was evidently
strictly planned.

We cannot attribute the regular layout of Sirkap wholly to the orderly
Greeks. Two thousand years before their arrival in India the cities of
Mohenjo Daro and Harappā had been laid out on similar regular lines, and
there is little doubt that other Indian cities were carefully planned. It was by
no means uncommon for a powerful king to build a wholly new capital, and
this would give much scope to the town-planner. The Arthaśāstra9 gives
detailed instructions for the establishment of such a new city. It advises a
square gridiron plan, divided into wards or sectors by six main roads, three
running north and south, and three east and west. The chief temples were to
be located in the centre, and different classes of the community were to be
segregated in separate wards. The fortified city of Sisupalgarh was certainly
built as an almost exact square of nearly a mile on each side (pl. XIa), but it
has not been sufficiently excavated to ascertain whether the street plan
conformed to the Arthaśāstra’s scheme.10 It is possible that the northern
city of Ahicchatra in Uttar Pradesh did so approximately, but here again the
excavated portions are not sufficient to tell with certainty.

The city had two foci, the palace and the temple. Of ancient Indian palace
architecture we know little; the fragments of the highly polished columns of
the Mauryan palace at Pataliputra, and a large building at Taksasila which
may have been a palace, are all that have survived except from a very late
period; but from this and other evidence it would seem that the palace was
usually situated in or near the centre of the city, and that it was often
defended by fortifications as a sort of citadel.

Temples have survived better, though we have no Hindu temples from
pre-Gupta times. In the temple the religious sentiments of the people were
largely concentrated. From the temple came the great and splendid religious
processions which filled and still fill the heart of the ordinary Hindu with
almost superhuman exaltation. The temple, especially if it was a great and
famous temple in one of the sacred cities, 1 was itself a city in miniature in
the medieval period (fig. xv). It was enormously wealthy, and a source of
wealth to the town from the many pilgrims who visited it. Such a temple
was a great landowner, with many employees, such as priests, musicians,
attendants, and dancing girls for the temple services, a staff of scribes and
accountants, and many craftsmen and labourers. Often the [Page 201]
temple maintained schools and refuges for sick men and animals; it
dispensed charity to beggars, and relieved the poorer citizens in time of
distress and famine. Like the medieval European monastery it might grant
land and privileges to its servants in princely wise. The great temple,
especially in the Deccan, was a corporate body which often played a bigger
part in the life of the ordinary citizen than the civil government. The larger
Buddhist and Jaina monasteries were similarly influential in their own
districts, though they were usually located outside the big cities.

From literary sources, and from the evidence of sculpture and painting,
we can get some idea of the houses of the wealthy, which probably did not
differ greatly, except in size, from the palaces of kings. The typical larger
town house was one of several storeys; threestoreyed buildings seem to
have been quite common, and there are literary references to houses of
seven and even eleven storeys, though the latter at least are hardly credible.


Down to Gupta times most houses, from palaces to small cottages, were
built with barrel-vaulted roofs, with gable-ends and often ornate finials (fig.

xiv). Roofs were both thatched and tiled. Later the high barrel-vaulted roof
gave way to a flatter type, with overhanging eaves. Larger houses of later
times usually had raised terraces or flat roofs on which the members of the
household slept in hot weather. In historical times houses were not, like the
houses of the Indus cities, closed in by bare [Page 202] walls, but had
windows and balconies overlooking the street. In the medieval period the
balconies were often screened with lattices, so that the ladies of the
household might see without being seen, but the balconies of houses
depicted at Bhārhut and Sānchū have no such screens. The walls were
whitewashed, and, as today, might be decorated with painted pictures and
ornamentation, both on the flat and in stucco relief. The usual larger house
had a square courtyard surrounded by a veranda, behind which were the
living quarters. Bathrooms are mentioned in literature, sometimes with
running water, probably diverted from a nearby stream.

The ancient Indian greatly loved flowers and trees. Megasthenes
describes with wonder the beautiful parks surrounding the palace of
Candragupta Maurya, and many references in Sanskrit literature show that
wealthy citizens had gardens attached to their houses, and often larger parks
in the suburbs containing pavilions in which they spent much of their
leisure. There are references in poetry to artificial hillocks ( krīdāśaila),
which suggest that landscape gardens of the Japanese type were sometimes
laid out.

As in all hot climates an expanse of water was an almost essential feature
of the garden, and the parks of the wealthy contained artificial lakes and
pools, often with fountains, and with steps leading down to them for
bathing. A further refinement, for cooling the air in the hot season, was the
“water-machine”( variyantra), which, from the description of the poet
Kālidāsa, 11 seems to have been a sort of revolving spray, rather like that
used to water lawns at the present day. In the bathing pools the citizens
would cool themselves in the hot weather, and literature contains many
references to kings and heroes playing in the water with their wives and
concubines. We also read of subterranean chambers at one end of such
bathing tanks, 12 cooled by the water surrounding them on all sides, in which
the tired bather might rest. Another feature of the pleasure garden which
was looked on as almost indispensible was a swing, in which adults of both
sexes took delight. Gardens were watered by channels which led from the
main tank to the trees and flower beds.

Specially loved were flowering trees, which are very frequently
mentioned in poetry, especially the asoka (Saraca indica), a smallish tree
bearing a mass of lovely scarlet or orange blossoms, which, it was said,
would only flower if kicked by a beautiful woman; other favourites were
the tall pale-flowered sirisa ( Albizzia spp. ), the fragrant, orange-flowered
kadamba ( Anthocephalus cadamba), and the red kiṃśuka ( Butea frondosa);
the banana ( kadalī) was grown for ornament as well as for its fruit. Bushes
and creepers were also much loved, especially the jasmine, of which there
were many varieties, and [Page 203] the white atimukta (Hiptage
madablota); other popular trees were the campaka (Michelia champaca),
with very fragrant yellow flowers, and the hibiscus, or China rose ( japā).

Most beloved of all flowers, and the subject of much religious and other
symbolism, was the lotus or water-lily, in its many varieties. This beautiful
flower the poets never tired of mentioning, giving it dozens of synonyms
and epithets. The rose, common enough in North India today, was
apparently unknown, and was probably introduced by the Muslims.

As well as the private gardens of the rich there were public gardens and
parks, often mentioned in story. In the vicinity of most cities were groves
which were the favourite resorts of the townspeople. Asoka took pride in
the fact that he had planted such groves for the recreation of man and beast,
and some other kings are recorded as having followed his example.

Of the life and homes of the city poor we are told little in literature, but
the cottages here and there depicted in early sculpture are, like the larger
houses, barrel-roofed, and apparently one-roomed. We must assume that the
poorer folk dwelt, as they do today, in huts made of wood, reed or mud
brick, and thatched with straw. Many no doubt had no homes at all, but
slept in odd corners of the city with their few possessions around them.

Efforts were made by the more energetic authorities to provide some
amenities for the poorer citizens. The Arthaśāstra suggests that a public
well should be provided for every ten families. The same text recommends
a fixed tariff of fines for leaving rubbish in the streets, and stringent
precautions against fires; every home was to keep elementary fire-fighting
equipment in readiness, and on an outbreak of fire all able-bodied citizens
in the neighbourhood were liable to be called on to help put out the flames.

The city authorities were to provide drainage for surface water, and fines
were to be imposed for blocking the drains.13 We cannot tell how far these
recommendations were put into practice, but it is hardly likely that they had
no basis whatever in fact.

Undoubtedly the most remarkable description of an ancient Indian city is
contained in the early Tamil poem The Garland of Madurai, said to have
been written in honour of a 2nd century Pāṇḍyan king Neduñjeliyaṉ, but
probably a century or two later. After a long panegyric on the king, the poet
describes the various regions of his kingdom, and concludes with an
account of his capital city, Madurai. This is too long to quote, but we must
at least summarize this part of the lovely poem, which has a realism rare in
the literature of the North.

The poet enters the city by its great gate, the posts of which are
carved [Page 204] with images of the goddess Laksmi, and which is
grimy with ghee, poured in oblation upon it to bring safety and
prosperity to the city it guards. It is a day of festival, and the city is gay
with flags, some, presented by the king to commemorate brave deeds,
flying over the homes of captains, and others waving over the shops
which sell the gladdening toddy. The streets are broad rivers of people,
folk of every race, buying and selling in the market-place or singing to
the music of wandering minstrels.

A drum beats, and a royal procession passes down the street, with
elephants leading to the sound of conchs. A refractory beast breaks his
chain, and tosses like a ship in an angry sea until he is again brought to
order. Chariots follow, with prancing horses and fierce footmen.

Meanwhile stall-keepers ply their trade, selling sweet cakes,
garlands of flowers, scented powder and betel quids. Old women go
from house to house, selling nosegays and trinkets to the womenfolk.

Noblemen drive through the streets in their chariots, their gold-
sheathed swords flashing, wearing brightly-dyed garments and wreaths
of flowers. From balconies and turrets the many jewels of the
perfumed women who watch the festival flash in the sunlight.

The people flock to the temples to worship to the sound of music,
laying their flowers before the images and honouring the holy sages.

Craftsmen work in their shops-men making bangles of conch shell,
goldsmiths, cloth-dealers, coppersmiths, flower-sellers, vendors of
sandalwood, painters and weavers. Foodshops busily sell their wares-
greens, jak-fruit, mangoes, sugar candy, cooked rice and chunks of
cooked meat.

In the evening the city prostitutes entertain their patrons with
dancing and singing to the sound of the lute ( yāḻ), so that the streets are
filled with music. Drunken villagers, up for the festival, reel in the
roadways, while respectable women, make evening visits to the
temples with their children and friends, carrying lighted lamps as
offerings. They dance in the temple courts, which are clamorous with
their singing and chatter.

At last the city sleeps-all but the goblins and ghosts who haunt the
dark, and the bold housebreakers, armed with rope ladders, swords and
chisels, to break through the walls of mud houses. But the watchmen
are also vigilant, and the city passes the night in peace.

Morning comes with the sound of brāhmaṇs intoning their sacred
verses. The wandering bards renew their singing, and the shopkeepers
busy themselves opening their booths. The toddy-sellers again ply
their trade for thirsty morning travellers. The drunkards reel to their
feet and once more shout on the streets. All over the city is heard the
sound of opening doors. Women sweep the faded flowers of the
festival from their courtyards. Thus the busy everyday life of the city is
resumed.14
The ancient Indian city was a source of pride to its inhabitants. One of
the most memorable records of such pride is contained in the 5th century
Mandasor inscription of the guild of silk-weavers, already mentioned in
another connexion (p. 149). This commemorates the building and
subsequent repair by the guild of a splendid temple of [Page 205] the Sun.

A poem recording the event was composed “with great care” by one
Vatsabhatti, probably a local hack-poet commissioned for the occasion, and
was engraved on stone as a perpetual memorial. No doubt echoing the
thought of his patrons, Vatsabhatti writes in glowing terms of his city,
“Where the water-lilies are ever shaken by tremulous ripples,
and the geese are as though shut in a cage of pollen,
blown from the lotuses, which shine in the lakes,
bent by the weight of their own stamens;
“Where the groves are adorned with trees
bowed under the burden of blossoms,
and with bee-swarms, drunk with honey,
and with women ever-singing;
“Where lovely women dwell
in houses a-flutter with flags,
most purely white, most lofty,
like fair hills of cloud that glitter with the vine of the lightning;
“Where other mansions, adorned with groves of swaying bananas,
lovely as the high peak of Mount Kailāśa,
shine with their long roof-ridges and pavilions,
loud with the noise of music, and gay with pictures.”
And so the poet in fanciful language describes the beauty of the city, the
goodness of the local king, the benevolence of the guild, and the splendour
of the new temple, until he concludes:
“As the moon the clear heavens,
as the kaustubha2 the breast of Visnu,
this fairest of temples adorns
our wholly noble city.”15


THE MAN ABOUT TOWN
We can learn much about the life of the Greek and Roman bourgeoisie
from literature and archæological remains; but the comparable literature of
India was less realistic, and there is no Indian counterpart of Pompeii.

Nevertheless there is enough evidence to reconstruct the life of the well-to-
do young Indian in some detail from secular literature, one of our most
important sources being the treatise on erotics, the Kāmasūtra (p. 171),
which was composed to instruct him in one of his chief recreations.

His room, we are told, 16 should contain a pleasant and soft bed, [Page
206] with a pure white coverlet, a decorated canopy, and two pillows, one at
the foot and the other at the head. It should also have a divan, at the head of
which perfumed unguents, flowers, and pots of collyrium should be kept on
a little table. On the floor nearby should be placed a cuspidor, to receive the
red expectoration caused by betel chewing, and a chest for ornaments and
clothes. On the wall should hang a lute ( vīṇ ā), and the room should also
contain a drawing table, a few palm-leaf books, a round seat and a gaming-
board. Attached to the house should be an aviary, a garden containing
swings, an arbour of climbing plants, and a grass bank on which the owner
might sit in the shade with his guests.

Rising in the morning the man about town washes, cleans his teeth,
anoints his body with unguents and perfume, puts collyrium on his eyes,
dyes his lips with red lac, and looks at himself in the mirror. Then he chews
a betel quid to sweeten his breath. He baths every day, rubs his body with
oil every other day, shaves his face every fourth day, and his whole body
every fifth or tenth day. He eats three meals daily. Much of his time is spent
in charming, graceful idleness. He amuses himself by teaching his parrots
and mynahs to talk, or by watching fighting cocks, quails or rams; he
converses with the parasites who surround him. In the hotter weather he
takes an afternoon nap.

He had many intellectual pleasures however. He was not merely a patron
and passive admirer of the arts, but was encouraged by society to be himself
creative. He should know something of the sixty-four arts (p. 183). He
might be a poet in his own right, and some of the surviving Sanskrit poetry
is not the work of professionals. Large gatherings were often held under the
patronage of kings or wealthy men for the recitation of poetry, and smaller
groups would often meet together for the same purpose, either at the home
of one of the group, or at the house of a courtesan. These literary parties are
mentioned in the Kāmasūtra as among the chief pleasures of the educated
man. The members of such circles might form regular social clubs, and
“should stand together in time of trouble as in prosperity, … and hospitably
entertain newcomers to their group”.17 The ancient Indian, like his modern
descendant, was usually an extrovert, delighting in the company of his
fellows, and warm-hearted in his friendships. The immense stress laid in
sacred literature on the duty of hospitality encouraged and gave religious
sanction to the social propensities of the time.

Sometimes literary parties were held in the open air, in the gardens and
groves about the town, and might be diversified with cock-fighting and
bathing. The educated man might also be a painter; his [Page 207] sanctum,
as we have seen, contained a painting-board or easel, and the Kāmasūtra
even suggests that he should have a special room for sculpture, wood-
carving and clay modelling.



AMUSEMENTS
The amusements of the ancient Indian townsman were by no means all
creative or intellectual. Numerous festivals, participated in by rich and poor
alike, divided the Hindu year, and were marked by merrymaking and
processions. The most popular festival in early times was the Festival of
Spring, in honour of Kama, the Love-god, who, though he played only a
small part in the thought of the theologians, was evidently a very popular
divinity. At this festival even respectable citizens forgot their caste
restrictions, and paraded the streets scattering red powder over their
neighbours, squirting them with coloured water, and playing all kinds of
practical jokes. The festival still survives under the name Holi, though the
Love-god now plays no part in it. It is clearly the survival of a primitive and
bloody fertility ceremony; but even at its earliest appearance the grim
significance of the red powder seems to have been lost, and it was a sort of
Hindu saturnalia, a time of universal merrymaking, and licence of all kinds.

Though much reprobated by the brāhmaṇ authors of the Smtri literature,
gambling was popular at all times and among all classes except the more
rigidly religious people. Six-sided dice have been found in the Indus cities,
and the “Gamester’s Lament” of the Ṛ g Veda testifies to the popularity of
gambling among the early Āryans (p. 403ff).

The word aksa in the context of gambling is generally roughly translated
“dice”, but the aksas in the earliest gambling games were not dice, but
small hard nuts called vibhīśaka or vibhīdaka; apparently players drew a
handful of these from a bowl and scored if the number was a multiple of
four. Later, oblong dice with four scoring sides were used; like the
European gamester the Indian employed a special terminology for the
throws at dice: krta (cater, four), treta (trey), dvāpara (deuce), and kali
(ace). So important was gambling in the Indian scheme of things that these
four terms were applied to the four periods ( yuga) of the æon (p. 321).

Gambling played a small but significant part in the ritual of the royal
consecration ceremony, and the gambling hall attached to the king’s palace
in the later Vedic period had some magical or religious significance, though
its import is not wholly clear. Among the chief men of the realm, whose
loyalty was confirmed by a special ceremony at the consecration of the king
[Page 208] (p. 42), was the akṛṣṇ avāpa, or thrower of nuts or dice,
evidently the organizer of the royal gambling parties. The plot of the
Mahābhārata hinges round a great gambling tournament, at which
Yudhisthira lost his kingdom to his wicked cousin Duryodhana, and the
Epic tells a similar story in the episode of Nala. The Arthaśāstra 18
advocates the strict control of gambling, which it would confine entirely to
officially-managed gambling houses, financed by a tax of five per cent of
the stakes and a charge for the hire of dice to gamblers, who were to be
forbidden to use their own. Stringent fines were laid down for cheating.

With the dice were played board games, similar to our children’s games
such as ludo, which involved a combination of chance and skill. By the
early centuries of the Christian era one of these, played on a board of sixty-
four squares ( aṣṭ apāda), had developed into a game of some complexity,
with a king-piece, and pieces of four other types, corresponding to the corps
of the ancient Indian army-an elephant, a horse, a chariot or ship, and four
footmen. The original game needed four players, and their moves were
controlled by the throw of the dice. As the game was played with pieces
representing military forces, and its strategy suggested that of campaigning
armies, it was known as caturanga, or “four corps”. In the 6th century the
game was learnt by the Persians, and when Persia was conquered by the
Arabs it quickly spread all over the Middle East, under the name shatranj,
the Persian corruption of caturanga. It developed into a game for two
persons, each with two “armies”, the king of one army becoming the
“general” or “minister” of the other, and the use of dice to control the
moves was given up. It is not quite certain whether these improvements
were made in India or Persia, but the latter is more probable.

The game was learnt by the crusaders from the Muslims, and soon spread
over Europe. By the late Middle Ages it had almost attained its modern
form as chess, the “general” of the Muslim game becoming the queen. Thus
the world’s most intellectual game is the product of three cultures, each of
which contributed something to its finished form.

Organized outdoor games were not common, except among children and
young women, who are sometimes referred to as playing ball, like Nausicaa
in the Odyssey. A form of polo, introduced from Central Asia, became
popular among warriors in the Middle Ages, though it is little mentioned in
literature, and a kind of hockey was also played. But, in general, ancient
India did not put such stress on athletics as did the Mediterranean world.

Chariot racing is mentioned as early as the Ṛ g Veda, and bullock racing was
popular [Page 209] in the late medieval period. Boxing and wrestling are
often referred to, but were not generally the hobbies of respectable young
men, but the preserve of low-caste professional pugilists, who performed
for the amusement of an audience. The archery contest, however, was a
much-loved amusement of the warrior class, and vivid descriptions of such
contests occur in the Epics.

Classical sources refer to gladiatorial contests at the court of Candragupta
Maurya, and in the medieval Deccan duelling became frequent. The
Portuguese traveller Nuniz writes that if two nobles of Vijayanagara
quarrelled they would fight to the death in the presence of the king and his
court. 19 Despite the growth of the doctrine of non-violence throughout our
period, animal fights were always very popular. The favourite animals to be
pitted against each other were the fierce little Indian quail ( lāvaka), the cock
and the ram; we also read of fights between bulls, buffaloes and elephants
(pls. LXXVII, LXXVIII b).

One form of animal contest confined to the Dravidian South was the
bullfight, of which we have a vivid description in an early Tamil poem.20
This sport did not closely resemble the Spanish bullfight, where the scales
are heavily weighted against the bull, for here the bull appears to have had
the advantage. The fights were popular among herdsmen, who entered the
arena unarmed, and “embraced the bull” in an attempt to master it, rather
like the cowpunchers of an American rodeo. They made no attempt to kill
the bull, and it was not previously irritated, but the bullfight was evidently a
sport of great danger, for the poem contains a gory description of a
victorious bull, his horns hung with the entrails of his unsuccessful
opponents. The bullfight was looked on as an ordeal to test the manhood of
young men, since it is stated that the girls who watched the performance
would choose their husbands from among the successful competitors in a
sort of Tamil svayaṃ vara. Though Tamil literature gives no evidence of
this, the bullfight had certainly some ritual significance, and was connected
with the fertility of the crops. A similar sport was practised, as part of a
religious ceremonial, by the ancient Cretans, and this fact, like many others,
links the Tamils with the earliest civilizations of the Mediterranean world.

Wrestling with young steers is still a favourite pastime of some pastoral
peoples of India.

Many of the amusements of ancient India were provided by professional
entertainers. As well as those who practised highly developed arts such as
drama, music and dancing, there were others who travelled through town
and village, diverting the ordinary folk, who could not fully appreciate the
nuances of the more developed art [Page 210] forms. We read of musicians,
bards, acrobats, jugglers, conjurors and snake-charmers, popular then as
now. As well as the courtly theatre there was a folk-drama, occasionally
referred to in literature, which portrayed scenes of mythology and legend in
dance, song and mime, and from which the Sanskrit drama developed.



CLOTHES AND ORNAMENTS
The garments worn from Vedic times onwards did not fundamentally
differ from those of the modern Indian. Like most ancient peoples living in
hot climates Indians usually wore lengths of cloth, draped around the body
and over the shoulders, and fastened with a belt and pins. The lower
garment ( paridhāna, vasana) was usually such a cloth, fastened round the
waist with a belt or string ( mekhalā, raśanā); and the upper garment
( uttarīya) was another such length, draped shawl-wise over the shoulders.

The latter garment was often discarded in the home, or in hot weather,
especially by the lower orders. A third garment ( prāvāra) was also worn,
draped like a mantle or cloak, in the cold season.

This was the general garb of both sexes, as it is today, and varied only in
the size and pattern of the cloths and in the manner of wearing them.

Sometimes the lower garment was of very small proportions, or a mere
loincloth (pl. LXXV), but the lower garments of the rich often reached
almost to the feet. In early sculpture the lower garment is depicted as
elaborately pleated in front, and held with a long girdle, the end of which
hung down in front of the garment between the legs (pl. XXVIa). In some
sculptures the girdle appears to have been the end of the cloth itself, which
might also be thrown over the shoulders in the manner of the present day
sārī. Sometimes the end of the cloth was drawn between the legs and
fastened at the back in the manner of the dhotī.

Though all these garments were unstitched the art of sewing was not
unknown, and women are often depicted wearing jackets or bodices
( colaka, kañcuka) (pl. LXXXI). With the invasions of the Śakas and
Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia trousers were introduced, and were in vogue
among the ruling classes at least until Gupta times, for the Gupta kings are
often shown on their coins as wearing trousers (fig. xxiv, p. 381). Kuṣāṇa
kings are shown on their coins, and in the remarkable headless statue of
Kaniṣka (pls. XXXb, LXXXIIIe), wearing long quilted coats and quilted
trousers and boots of typically Central Asian type, which must have been as
uncomfortable in a temperature of over one hundred degrees as the thick
European clothing worn by the pioneers of the East India Company. The
wearing of shirts and [Page 211] trousers seems to have been quite common
in medieval Kashmīr and the North-West. In medieval South India
goddesses and queens were often depicted as wearing what seem to be light
close-fitting trousers. The cloth used for all these garments varied from
wool, worn in the Northern winters, to diaphanous silks and muslins, which
showed the limbs of the wearer. The paintings of Ajanta and Bagh show
that they were often dyed or otherwise patterned with gay stripes and
checks.

In most parts of India footwear was primarily used to protect the feet
against the scorching earth of the Indian summer, but in the Himalayas felt
boots of Central Asian pattern were worn.

On their heads men usually wore turbans, which were fastened in many
elaborate patterns (pl. XXIIIe). In early times, at least on festive occasions,
women wore large and complicated headdresses of a type not seen
nowadays, but by the Gupta period they are usually depicted either bare-
headed, or wearing head-veils or simple tiaralike headdresses. Orthodox
brāhmaṇs shaved the whole head with the exception of the topknot, which
was never cut, but with other classes both sexes usually allowed their hair
to grow long. The most popular coiffure with women was a large bun at the
nape of the neck, often ornamented with a fillet or string of jewels (pl.

LXIIe). The pigtail, most common at the present day, though attested in the
Harappā culture and mentioned in literature, does not often appear in
sculpture until the medieval period.

There is some controversy on the character of women’s dress in ancient
India. Throughout our period women are depicted in painting and sculpture
as naked to the waist, while on the other hand the great physical modesty of
modern Hindu womanhood is common knowledge. James Fergusson, one
of the first serious students of ancient Indian sculpture, declared
categorically that, until the Muslim conquest, Hindu women exposed their
breasts in public without the least shame.21 This conclusion has, however,
been controverted.22
It is asserted that, like the Greeks and Romans, the Indian artist and
sculptor followed a tradition of showing the female form in a state of semi-
nakedness, when this had no counterpart in real life. The objection,
however, is hardly valid. When portraying real life, rather than mythology
or figure studies, the classical artist usually draped his women. In the early
sculptures of Bhārhut and Sānchū, on the other hand, there is scarcely a
woman with covered breasts, even among the crowds in the very realistic
reliefs of Indian city life. References to bodices in literature are numerous,
and women with covered breasts do sometimes appear in painting and
sculpture; but [Page 212] in the Northern Plains, and the hillier parts of the
Deccan, the weather is quite cool for several months of the year, and the use
of bodices may have been due rather to climate than to modesty. In
Malabar, where many old customs survived long, it was quite normal until
comparatively recent times for women of the Nayyar caste to appear in
public naked to the waist, and the same is true of the island of Bali, which
adopted Hindu culture early in the Christian era. In some literary sources
there are references to married women wearing veils, but there is no
evidence that these were regularly more than headcoverings, or that they
concealed the form of the wearer. It is only in late medieval literature that
clear expressions of the need of physical, as distinct from mental, modesty
are found. Women in ancient India were considerably restricted in their
activities, and a high standard of modesty was demanded of those of the
higher classes (p. 179f); but it is clear that their ideas of propriety in dress
were very different from those of their descendants.

If clothes were simple and few, ornaments were complex and many.

Gold, silver and precious stones of every available kind were always in
demand for personal adornment. Women wore jewelled ornaments on their
foreheads, and along the partings of their hair. Earrings were worn by both
sexes, and the ears were stretched by heavy and large ornaments, as is done
by women in the Tamil country districts to this day. Ornate necklaces were
worn, and wide girdles of linked gold with hanging ropes of pearls. Bangles
and armlets were popular from the days of the Harappā Culture onwards,
and anklets, often set with little tinkling bells, or with their hollows filled
with rattling pebbles, were as popular then as now. Nose ornaments,
without which Indian women of the older generation felt positively
undressed, are nowhere mentioned or depicted, and their use can only have
been widely adopted after the Muslim conquest. The few surviving pieces
of jewellery, and the representations of jewellery in sculpture and painting,
show that the Indian jeweller attained very high standards in his art (pl.

LXXXIIb). It would seem that the early Indian, like his modern counterpart,
would often save his money by investing it in jewellery for his wife and
himself. Even the poorer people, who could not afford gold or gems, loaded
themselves with jewellery of silver, brass, glass and painted pottery, and all
classes adorned their hair, ears and necks with the beautiful flowers which
India provides in abundance.

Cosmetics were used by both sexes. Chief among these was a paste made
of finely ground dust of sandalwood, which was smeared over the whole
body or applied in patterns, often coloured with lac and other dyes. It was
believed to cool the skin in the hot season. [Page 213] Collyrium or eye-
salve ( anjana), usually made of black powdered antimony, was very
popular, and, as well as enhancing the beauty of the eye,was thought to
prevent ophthalmia. Vermilion ( sindura), lac ( lākṣ ā), and a yellow pigment
called gorocana, were used to mark the beauty-spot on the forehead
( tilaka), which might often be large and ornate, and which is still popular
with Indian ladies. The lips, the tips of the fingers and toes, and the palms
and soles of the feet, were often dyed red with lac. Though exposed parts of
the body were often painted with complicated patterns there is no clear
evidence of tattooing, which is popular nowadays in many parts of India.



FOOD AND DRINK
When Fa-hsien visited India in the early 5th century he reported that no
respectable person ate meat, the consumption of which was confined to low
castes. He probably exaggerated, but certainly by this time many Hindus of
the higher classes were vegetarians. The growth of vegetarianism was of
course linked with the doctrine of non-violence, which was already old at
the time of Fa-hsien. It was known in the days of the Upanisads and was
elaborated by Buddhism and Jainism, which were largely responsible for
the gradual disappearance of the greater Vedic sacrifices at which large
numbers of animals were killed and eaten. The reign of Asoka is a
landmark in the development of vegetarianism, for he encouraged it by his
own example, and forbade outright the killing of many animals. But the
Arthaśāstra accepts meat-eating as quite normal, and lays down rules for
the management of slaughterhouses and the maintenance of the purity of
meat. 23 It was only with the growth of Mahayana Buddhism and the new
Hinduism that strict vegetarianism became widespread. Even then hunting
and meat-eating were practised by the warrior class, and the tantric cults of
the Middle Ages restored the practice of sacrifice and meat-eating in a new
form. Medical texts, even of a late period, go so far as to recommend the
use of both meat and alcohol in moderation, and do not forbid the eating of
beef. It is doubtful if complete vegetarianism has ever been universal in any
part of India, though in many regions it was and still is practised by most
high-caste Hindus. With the prohibition of meat-eating some religious texts
included that of eating garlic and onions, the objection to which arose for
obvious reasons, and was never given a real religious basis; but it is very
doubtful if this ban ever had any great effect until a very late period, except
on pious brāhmaṇs.

There are several references to the science of cookery ( supasastra),
which was not disdained even by kings, but no ancient textbook on [Page
214] cookery has survived. From passages in literature we know that
ancient Indian cookery did not differ much from that of the present day.

Meat and vegetables alike were seasoned in curries and eaten with rice,
boiled or fried. With the curry and rice flat cakes of flour, the modern
chapādī, were eaten, and water, milk, or curd were drunk. The favourite
cooking medium was ghee, in which the food was fried and which was
poured liberally over the dish; poorer folk often substituted for ghee the oil
of sesamum or mustard. Fruit and sweetmeats of many kinds were as
popular as they are today, but many of the Indian sweets eaten nowadays,
such as the jalebi, are Muslim importations.

In modern Hinduism there is a strong taboo on the drinking of alcoholic
beverages, and most of those who drink regularly are either very
Europeanized in their ways or of low caste. The moral objection to alcohol
is very ancient, but it was long before the ban became widespread, except
among brāhmaṇs. Though Asoka discouraged meat-eating his edicts say
nothing about drinking, and it is therefore evident that he had no strong
moral objections to it, though Buddhism counts the drinking of spirits as
one of the five cardinal sins (p. 286). In Asoka’s day Buddhism was
apparently more lax in this respect than it later became. The lawbooks
condemned drinking, and Fa-hsien stated that respectable Indians did not
drink, but drinking and drunkenness are so frequently mentioned in
literature, especially in that of the Tamils, that it is clear that religious
precept was not regularly followed in this particular. Only in the 12th
century do we find Kumarapala, the Jaina king of Gujarat, forbidding the
production and sale of liquor throughout his kingdom.

The Arthaśāstra advises the manufacture of liquor in government
breweries and distilleries, and gives several brief and cryptic recipes,24
which show that there were many alcoholic drinks, some of which are not
popular nowadays; among these were rice beer ( medaka), a sort of spiced
beer made of flour ( prasannā), wood-apple wine ( āsava), maireya, a liquor
made of raw sugar, the bark of the meṣ aśṅ ga tree, and pepper, and mango
spirit ( sahakārasurā). Wine from grapes was made in the North-West, and
exported in small quantities to the rest of India. In the South, toddy, the
fermented sap of the palmyra or coconut, was the staple alcoholic liquor,
and is frequently mentioned in early Tamil literature.

The Arthaśāstra, perhaps reflecting Mauryan conditions, suggests the
appointment of a “superintendent of liquor”, not only to control the sale and
consumption of alcoholic drinks but to organize their manufacture. The text
advises the stringent control of private brewing, and of taverns. Tavern-
keepers were to be instructed to make [Page 215] their establishments well-
furnished and comfortable, and to prevent their patrons from over-
indulgence; the text even suggests that they should indemnify them for any
loss sustained while under the influence of liquor, and pay a fine into the
bargain. Unlike most other oriental traders tavern-keepers, according to the
Arthaśāstra, were not to be allowed to build their premises close together,
thus discouraging the ancient Indian equivalent of “pub-crawling”; the text
also suggests the complete prohibition of the consumption of alcohol “off
the premises”. The taverns were often the haunts of criminals, and the
king’s spies were advised to keep a watchful eye on them. The Arthaśāstra
evidently recognizes drinking as an evil, which cannot be wholly forbidden,
but which must be strictly controlled.



ECONOMIC LIFE
It has often been said that ancient Indian society was not an acquisitive
one. Admittedly the brāhmaṇs, who claimed moral and spiritual leadership,
set themselves ideals of dignified austerity, but these ideals were not always
followed in practice. A brāhmaṇ who attained a good local reputation for
the efficient performance of sacrifices and domestic ceremonies might
amass considerable wealth, and if patronized by kings might become a
really rich man. Corporations of such brāhmaṇs often lived on the proceeds
of large agricultural estates ( agrahāra), transferred to them by kings, and
there are accounts of brāhmaṇ landowners living in great wealth. Other
brāhmaṇs, not sufficiently trained to teach the Vedas or to sacrifice,
obtained high posts in government service, or even became wealthy by
trade. We have seen (p. 170) that, according to the doctrine of the three
aims of life, the place of wealth in the Hindu scheme of things was well
established.

In most early Indian literature the world is viewed from the angle of the
well-to-do. Poverty, it is more than once said, is living death; to serve
another for one’s keep is a dog’s life, and not worthy of an Āryan. From the
time of the Ṛ g Veda, which contains many prayers for riches, worldly
wealth was looked on as morally desirable for the ordinary man, and indeed
essential to a full and civilized life. The ascetic, whether Buddhist or Jaina,
who voluntarily abandoned his wealth, performed an act of renunciation
which entitled him to the utmost respect. Though by this renunciation he
assured himself of spiritual advancement, and was well on the way to
salvation ( mokṛṣṇ a), the fourth and ultimate aim of existence, the ascetic’s
life was not that of the ordinary man, and the theoretical classification of
the four stages of life (p. 158f) gave ample scope in the second stage to the
[Page 216] householder, who was indeed encouraged to build up the family
fortunes, and to spend part of them at least on the pleasures of the senses.

Thus the ideals of ancient India, while not perhaps the same as those of the
acquisitive West, by no means excluded money-making. India had not only
a class of luxury-loving and pleasure-seeking dilettanti, but also one of
wealth-seeking merchants and prosperous craftsmen, who, though less
respected than the brāhmaṇs and warriors, were honoured in society.

Though the basis of ancient Indian industry was at all times the
individual craftsman, aided chiefly by members of his own family, larger
manufactories, worked chiefly by hired labour, were by no means unknown.

Not only did the Mauryan state own spinning and weaving workshops (p.

179f), but also shops for the manufacture of weapons and other military
supplies, employing salaried craftsmen. The larger mines were also owned
and worked by the state. But though the economic order approximated to a
sort of state socialism in the time of the Mauryas, it always left scope for
the individual producer and distributor. We read here and there of private
producers who had far transcended the status of the small home craftsman,
and who manufactured on a large scale for a wide market. Thus an early
Jaina text25 tells of a wealthy potter named Saddalaputta who owned 500
potters’ workshops, and a fleet of boats which distributed his wares
throughout the Ganges valley; there are a few other references, which
confirm that large scale production for a wide market was not unknown in
ancient India, though such industrialists as Saddalaputta were no doubt
comparatively rare.

A form of industrial organization on a larger scale than the individual
craftsman, and probably more common than the entrepreneur, was the
workmen’s co-operative group, perhaps comparable to the pre-
revolutionary Russian artel; such groups are mentioned in the Pali Jataka
stories and elsewhere as carrying out large scale enterprises such as the
building of temples and houses. Their existence tended to encourage
division of labour; thus one man would fashion the shaft of an arrow, a
second would fix the flights, and a third would make and fix the point.

Rules are laid down in the lawbooks for the punishment of breach of
contract by such co-operatives or their individual members.

Much of the work of the craftsman was sold at the door of his workshop
direct to the purchaser. Normally each craft or trade was concentrated in a
separate street or bazaar, where the craftsman had his workshop, stall and
home. The testimony of Megasthenes, corroborated by the Arthaśāstra,
shows that in Mauryan times prices were regulated by market officials. The
latter text suggests that, as a [Page 217] further effort at maintaining a just

price, government officers should buy on the open market when any staple
commodity was cheap and plentiful, and release stocks from government
stores when it was in short supply,26 thus bringing down the price and
making a profit for the king into the bargain. We have no definite evidence
that this idea was ever put into effect, but it is striking that ancient Indian
political theorists anticipated by over 2,000 years the plans put forward by
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for
maintaining a stable level of prices of staple commodities on a world-wide
scale.

GUILDS
As well as the state, another element did much to control prices and
standards of work. This was the guild ( śreṇ i), a form of industrial and
mercantile organization which played as big a part in the economy of
ancient India as it did in that of any other ancient or medieval civilization.

There are faint and uncertain references to some sort of guild organization
even in Vedic literature, but by the time of the composition of the Buddhist
scriptures guilds certainly existed in every important Indian town, and
embraced almost all trades and industries-we even read of a guild of
thieves.

The guild united both the craftsmen’s co-operatives and the individual
workmen of a given trade into a single corporate body. It fixed rules of
work and wages, and standards and prices for the commodities in which its
members dealt, and its regulations had the force of law, and were upheld by
the king and government. Over its own members the guild had judicial
rights, which were recognized by the state. A guild court could, like a caste
council, expel a refractory member, a penalty which would virtually
preclude him from practising his ancestral trade and reduce him to beggary.

We read in Buddhist literature of guild courts settling quarrels between
members and their wives, and the rules of the Buddhist order lay down that
a married woman may not be ordained a nun without the consent of her
husband and his guild. Thus the guild had power not only over the
economic, but also over the social life of its members. It acted as guardian
of their widows and orphans, and as their insurance against sickness. Its
powers and functions in this respect were very similar to those of caste
councils in more recent times, and, though some authorities would disagree
with us, we cannot but conclude that the guilds played an important part in
the evolution of the trade castes.

The guild was headed by a chief, usually called the “Elder” ( jyeṣṭ haka,
in Pāli jeṭṭ haka), who was assisted by a small council of [Page 218] senior
members. The office of Elder was usually hereditary and held by one of the
richest members of the guild. In the Pali scriptures the Elder is invariably
described as a very wealthy man, often with much influence at the palace,
and counselling the king himself. The guilds had a corporate life,
symbolized, as in medieval Europe, by the possession of banners, and also
of chauris,3 the ceremonial yak’s tail flywhisks which were insignia of
nobility. These and other emblems were sometimes granted by royal
charter, and were carried in local religious processions by the guildsmen.

Some guilds, again like those of medieval Europe, had their own militias,
which served as auxiliaries of the king’s armies in time of need (p. 128).

All over India are to be found inscriptions recording the donations of
guilds to religious causes of all kinds, the most famous being that of the
Mandasor silk-weavers, to which we have already referred. The guilds must
have had considerable funds to make such large donations, and no doubt
received regular subscriptions from their members, which were augmented
by fines levied on those who transgressed the guild law. They sometimes
acted as bankers and trustees. There are references in the legal literature to
guilds accepting deposits, and lending money at interest to merchants and
others. They would often act as trustees of religious endowments; the pious
would pay a sum of money to a guild, on condition that it would maintain a
perpetual lamp in a temple, or provide new robes annually for the monks of
a Buddhist monastery. Inscriptions recording such acts of benevolence are
quite numerous, and no doubt the guilds, while duly carrying out their part
of the agreement, profited from the transactions.

The corporate spirit of the guild gave the better type of craftsman and
merchant a degree of self-respect which he would not otherwise have
found. There is more than one record of riots and affrays between different
guilds and trade groups; this was specially the case in the medieval Deccan,
where guild and caste often overlapped in function or were virtually
synonymous, and the strange division of right and left hand castes led to
much friction (p. 150). The fact that more than one guild of the same craft is
occasionally recorded in the same place suggests that guilds sometimes
broke up.



TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT
At all times the work of the Indian craftsman, however primitive and
simple his tools, has been admired for its delicacy and skill, and the
technical achievement of ancient India was far from negligible. [Page 219]
Her spinners and weavers could produce semi-transparent silks and muslins
of extreme thinness, which are clearly depicted in sculpture (pl. XXXVIb),
and which were much in demand in the Roman Empire. Unlike ancient
Greece and medieval China, India developed no true ceramic art; indeed
from the æsthetic point of view no pottery of historical times is as good as
the simply patterned but well designed wares of the prehistoric North-West
(fig. iv); but the bright hard polish of the type of pottery usually called
“northern black polished ware” is a very creditable technical achievement.

In the working of stone on a large scale India’s skill is attested by the
enormous monolithic columns of Mauryan times. Many of these bear
Aśoka’s inscriptions, but it is not certain that they were made and erected
by him; some may have existed before his time. All are made of sandstone,
from the same quarry at Chunar, about twenty-five miles south-west of
BanĀras Some thirty columns have been found in many parts of Northern
India, from Sānchū in the south to the Nepalese Tarāī in the north. Their
sculptured capitals are great as works of art, but as evidence of Indian
technological achievement the columns are even more significant.

Weighing as much as fifty tons, and measuring some forty feet, they were
carved from single blocks of stone, given a polish of wonderful hardness
and lustre, and often transported many hundreds of miles to their present
positions. The process of their manufacture, polishing and transport has not
yet been fully explained, and the secret was apparently lost soon after the
Mauryan period, when the school of craftsmen who worked the Chunar
sandstone vanished. Though many fine examples of later stone carving have
come down to us, some much more impressive artistically than the
Mauryan columns, it is doubtful whether India ever again showed such
complete mastery of the handling of enormous pieces of stone.

Raichūr, Hyderābād). (Reproduced by permission of the Archæological Department, Government of
India)
The Iron Pillar of Meharauli, near Delhi, is even more remarkable,
though of little artistic value and less immediately impressive than the
Mauryan columns. It is a memorial to a king called [Page 220] Candra, who
was probably Candra Gupta II (c. 376–415), and now stands not far from
the famous Kutb Minar, one of the greatest monuments of Muslim India,
though it was originally erected on a hill near Ambālā. It is over twenty-
three feet high, and consists of a single piece of iron, of a size and weight
which could not have been produced by the best European ironfounders
until about one hundred years ago. As with the Mauryan columns we have
no clear evidence of how it was made, but it must have demanded immense
care and labour, and great technical proficiency in preparing and heating the
metal. The metallurgical skill of ancient India is further attested by the fact
that this pillar, though it has weathered the torrential rains of over 1,500
monsoons, shows no sign of rusting. This is not due to the fact that the
Indians had discovered some form of stainless steel alloy, for the column is
of iron almost chemically pure. The process of oxidization demands a
catalyst, and it is the great purity of the metal which has preserved it so
long, as another memorial to India’s technical skill.



TRADE AND FINANCE
A money economy only existed in India from the days of the Buddha.

That coinage was introduced from the west cannot be proved with certainty,
but the earliest clear references to coined money are found in texts looking
back to a period shortly after the foundation of the Achæmenid Empire in
Persia, which was the first great empire to mint an official coinage, and
which for a time controlled the Panjāb. The Babylonians and Assyrians
managed with unstamped silver shekels, but the Achæmenid emperors
adopted stamped coinage from Lydia and the Greek cities of Asia Minor,
which had already employed it for a century or two. If India did not learn
the use of coinage from the Persians she invented it independently, but the
coincidence is too striking to make this seem probable.

The earliest Indian coinage4 consisted of flat pieces of silver or bronze,
of irregular shape, but fairly accurate in weight. They bore no inscriptions,
but a number of punch-marks, the significance of which is not finally
established, but which probably included the emblems of kings who minted
the coins, and control marks of local officials and merchants. Inscribed
coins were not regularly minted in India until the 2nd century B.C., and
though literary evidence suggests that gold coinage may have existed earlier
the oldest surviving gold coins, other than one or two very rare specimens,
are those of Vīma Kadphises of the 1st century A.D. As well as the three
usual metals, [Page 221] coins of nickel were minted by some of the Greco-
Bactrian kings, while the Satavahanas of the Deccan made coins of lead,
and various alloys are attested. Small purchases were regularly paid for in
cowryshells ( varāṭ aka), which remained the chief currency of the poor in
many parts of India until recent times.

The concept of legal tender never seems to have taken root in Hindu
India, and coins were often current far beyond the borders of the kingdoms
which minted them. Some important dynasties, such as the Palas of Bengal,
did not regularly mint coins, but relied on those of other states. Coins
circulated less rapidly than they do nowadays, and might be current for
centuries; thus the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, a Greek text of the end of
the 1st century A.D., notices that the coins of Menander, who ruled in the
Panjāb at least two centuries earlier, were current in the port of Barygaza
(Bhrgukaccha, the modern Broach, at the mouth of the Narmada), which
was probably at least 500 miles from Menander’s kingdom. Foreign
currency circulated freely. In the North-West, Athenian drachms, as well as
local imitations, were current before the invasion of Alexander, and
Achæmenid, Seleucid, Parthian, Roman, Sasanian and Islamic coins were
used at different periods. In the South, numerous hoards of Roman imperial
coins have been found.

Though there is no evidence of a highly organized financial machinery of
cheques, drafts and letters of credit, usury was widespread, and
moneylending, except by brāhmaṇs, did not incur the reprobation of Hindu
moralists, as it did that of medieval Christianity and Islam. Even in the Ṛ g
Veda we read of indebtedness (p. 404), and the earliest Dharma Sūtras lay
down rates of interest, and regulations governing debts and mortgages. The
just rate of interest is generally given as 1¼ per cent. per month, or fifteen
per cent per year. Later commentators interpret this as applying only to
secured loans, and in practice rates of interest were often much higher.

Manu27 and some other lawgivers lay down a sliding scale of interest for
unsecured loans, according to the class of the debtor: brāhmaṇs 24 per
cent., ksatriyas 36 per cent., vaiśyas 48 per cent., and śūdras 60 per cent. per
year. The Arthaśāstra28 gives, beside the “just rate”, three other rates of
interest, inadequately defined, but apparently applicable to short-term loans
for commercial ventures: the normal commercial rate, 5 per cent. per
month; the rate for merchants travelling through forests (overland caravan
traders), 10 per cent. per month; and the rate for seafaring merchants, 20 per
cent. per month. These enormous rates of interest, 60, 120, and 240 per
cent. per year respectively, are measures of both the profit and the risk of
ancient Indian commerce.

[Page 222] Humane regulations on indebtedness are laid down in the
Arthaśāstra and some other legal texts. Interest payments should cease
when the total interest paid equals the principal. Loans advanced on
securities used by the creditor for his own profit (e.g. beasts of burden)
should be free of interest. Husbands are responsible for their wives’ debts,
but not wives for those of their husbands. But the later lawbooks provide
many escape clauses and sometimes completely set aside these earlier
injunctions. Debtors might be imprisoned, or enslaved by their creditors,
until they had worked off their debts. We read of debtors, dogged
everywhere by their creditors, and at last committing suicide in desperation.

The immense expense of the family ceremonials of Hinduism, periodic
dearth, the dowering of daughters, and many other factors, worked then as
now to drive the less fortunate into debt, and, then as now, the Indian
creditor might be a hard man.

We have seen that trade guilds might act as bankers, both receiving
deposits and issuing loans. The king or his local officer might make loans to
peasants to relieve dearth, or to encourage the cultivation of waste lands and
the development of irrigation. The larger temples also sometimes served as
bankers, and in the South the village communes occasionally made loans to
peasants. There were many professional bankers and moneylenders,
however, the śreṣṭ hins (in Pali, seṭṭ hi).5
The sresthin was not merely a moneylender or banker, but usually a
merchant as well. At all times until the coming of the Europeans, banking in
India was a by-product of trading, and most sresthins had other sources of
income besides moneylending. They appear as leading members of guilds,
often fabulously wealthy. Though the craftsman frequently sold his wares
direct to the consumer the peasants’ surplus products were largely in the
hands of middlemen, and a class of large merchants, as distinct from small
traders and pedlars, existed at least from the time of the Buddha. In the
Jataka stories we read of sresthins cornering grain, and buying at their own
price the products of craftsmen who were virtually their employees. The
term sresthin seems sometimes to have been a title of honour, held only by
merchants of wealth and consequence. In the Buddhist scriptures we read of
chief sresthins, honoured by kings, and with places in the royal councils.

Under the Guptas the chief banker or sresthin was sometimes a member of
the local advisory council which aided the district officer in controlling
local affairs (p. 103).

Though in early literature and inscriptions the srenis or guilds seem [Page
223] to have been chiefly organizations of producers, there were also guilds
or companies of merchants. Such merchant corporations became very
important in the medieval Deccan, and had branches in many cities. One
such was the Viravalanjigar, freely translated “the Company of Gentlemen
Merchants”, which had members in every important city of the Peninsula
and was controlled by a central council at Aihole, in Southern Hyderabad.

The company known as Maṇ igrāma functioned not only in Southern India,
but also in Ceylon, where it hired its mercenaries to the Sinhalese kings.

Co-operative ventures both in production and distribution were well
known in Hindu India, but they were normally carried out by temporary
associations of craftsmen and merchants, and these merchant companies
were in no way comparable to the modern joint stock company. Their
members may from time to time have undertaken corporate ventures, but
the normal function of the mercantile companies was not trading itself, but
protecting, furthering and regulating the activities of their members.

Overland caravans, though consisting of carts and pack animals owned and
led by individual merchants, would be organized and controlled by officers
of the company, and guarded by the company’s mercenaries. They played a
similar part in maritime trade, and probably owned warehouses and
“factories”, where their members might store their wares in safety.

Members travelling to strange cities would receive help from officers of the
local branch, and, like the craft guilds, the mercantile companies no doubt
helped members who fell on hard times, prevented adulteration,
undercutting and other malpractices, and represented their members at the
king’s court.



CARAVANS AND TRADE-ROUTES
By the time of the Buddha recognized trade-routes covered most of
Northern India, and by Mauryan times similar routes existed in the
Peninsula. Among the chief of these was one which ran from the Ganges
port of Tāmraliptī, not far from the modern Calcutta, up the river to the old
city of Campā, and thence through Pataliputra and Banāras to Kauśāmbī,
whence a branch went to the port of Bhrgukaccha on the mouth of the
Narmada by way of Vidiśā and Ujjayinī. From Kauśāmbī the main trunk
road passed along the south bank of the Jamnā to Mathurā, from which a
branch crossed the modern Rājasthān and the Thar Desert to the port of
Patala, near the mouth of the Indus. The main route passed on by the
modern Delhi and crossed the five rivers of the Panjāb by way of Sākala (?

Siālkot) to the north-western city of Takṣaśilā, whence it continued up the
Kabul Valley and on into Central Asia. The great cities to the north of the
[Page 224] Ganges and Jamnā were linked to the trunk route by recognized
branch roads. Though its course has varied somewhat through the centuries
this has always been the main artery of Northern India. The Mauryan
emperors cared for this great road, which was marked with milestones, and
provided with wells and rest-houses at regular intervals.

The main route to the South went from Ujjayini to the city of
Pratiṣṫhāna, in the N.-W. Deccan, the capital of the Sātavāhana empire
around the beginning of the Christian era. Thence it passed across the
Deccan Plateau to the lower Kistna, and went on to the great southern cities
of Kāñcī (Conjeeveram) and Madurai. A network of roads developed early
in the Christian era from this old route, linking all the more important cities
of the Peninsula. Contact between North and South by way of the east does
not at first seem to have been close or frequent, but routes from Pataliputra
to Orissa must have existed before the Mauryan period. In the more
unsettled times after the Mauryas the wild uncivilized forests of Central
India much discouraged travel, and the western route was the most
important until at least the Gupta period.

The larger rivers crossed en route by these roads were not bridged. Indian
engineering, though very competent in many respects, seems never to have
mastered the art of bridging a large river; but regular ferry services, in
Mauryan times regulated by the State, were maintained at every important
crossing.

European visitors to the Mughal Empire in the 17th century, were
impressed by the badness of the roads, which were atrocious even by the
low Western standards of the time. As road builders the Indians never
equalled the Romans, but the references in Asoka’s inscriptions, the
Arthaśāstra and elsewhere, show that under more energetic governments
roads were well maintained, and conditions under the Mughals may not
have been typical of earlier times. The medieval text on statecraft attributed
to Sukra tells of main roads forty-five feet wide, which were cambered, had
drains at both sides, and were regularly repaired with gravel.29
In the rainy season, roughly corresponding to the European summer, the
roads were practically impassable; rivers in spate could not be ferried, and
all travelling ceased; even the thousands of wandering religious mendicants,
who walked the length and breadth of India from one shrine to another,
would settle down until the rains had passed, in the precincts of a temple,
the outhouse of a kindly patron, or a cave near a village. But at other times
of the year, especially in the cool, bright winter, when the weather of
Northern India resembles a rainless late May in England, long caravans of
rumbling [Page 225] bullock carts and pack animals—oxen, asses, mules
and camels—travelled the dusty roads.

The roads were dangerous to the merchant-caravans. Many of the trade
routes linking centres of civilization passed through dense jungle, and over
hills where wild tribes dwelt. There were whole villages of professional
robbers, ready at all times to waylay the merchant. Other dangers were
incurred from wild beasts—tigers, elephants and snakes in particular-and
the remoter parts of the country were the reputed haunts of demons of many
malevolent kinds. In these circumstances merchants preferred to share their
perils together, and we read of as many as 500 men travelling in caravan.

Pali literature tells. of bands of professional caravan guards, who would
undertake to give guidance and safe conduct over a specified route, and
who seem to have been a regular feature of the caravan trade, at least where
the merchant corporations did not provide their own guards. If the
Arthaśāstra’s instructions on the duties of the antapāla (p. 108) have any
relation to facts it would seem that the Mauryan kings did much to
safeguard the roads, and the same is true of many other important dynasties;
but the danger that beset caravans from thieves is attested by many stories,
and by the enormous rate of interest which the Arthaśāstra permits on loans
to finance long distance trading ventures.

The caravan leader (sārthavāha) was an important figure in the
commercial community, and the Gupta copper-plates of Northern Bengal
(p. 103) show that the chief caravan leader of a locality might occupy an
important place on the district council. Another figure associated with the
caravan trade was the land-pilot (in Pali, thalaniyyāmaka), whose existence
is attested in the Pali scriptures; he guided caravans through deserts and
waste places, steering by the stars.

The great rivers were used to carry both goods and passengers in vessels
large and small. Chief of these was the Ganges, the artery of the Great
Plain, but the Indus and the rivers of the Deccan were also important as
trade routes. Like the land routes they were full of dangers: river pirates
were numerous, and in some rivers sandbanks, and in others submerged
rocks, were a peril to the navigators.

Luxury articles formed the chief objects of long-distance trade—spices,
sandal-wood, gold and gems from the South, silks and muslins from Bengal
and Banaras, musk, saffron and yaks’ tails from the Hills; but these were
not the only merchandise of the caravans. Many regions had to import
metal. The chief source of iron in India was South Bihār, and control of the
route from the iron producing areas around the modern Rānchī to the
Ganges may well have been one of [Page 226] the chief factors in the early
rise of Magadhan power. Copper was mined and smelted in various parts of
the Deccan, in Rajasthan, and in the Western Himalayas. Salt, an absolute
necessity in a hot climate, was imported from the sea coast, and from
various rock-salt deposits, notably in the Salt Range in the Panjāb. Certain
foodstuffs were articles of long-distance commerce: sugar was carried to
cooler and dryer regions where the cane would not grow, and rice imported
as a luxury food to parts of the North-West.



SEA-TRADE AND OVERSEAS CONTACTS
Whether or not the Āryans of the Ṛg Vedic period knew the sea, by the
time of the Buddha hardy sailors had probably circumnavigated the sub-
continent, and perhaps made the first contacts with Burma, Malaya and the
islands of Indonesia. In the early centuries of the Christian era maritime
trade became most vigorous, especially with the West, where the Roman
Empire demanded the luxuries of the East in great quantities. With the fall
of the Roman Empire the trade with the West declined somewhat, though it
was maintained by the Arabs, and improved gradually with the rising
material standards of medieval Europe. Before the time of the Guptas
contact was made by sea between South India and China, and as trade with
the West declined that with China increased, the Chinese demand for Indian
spices, jewels, perfumes, and other luxury commodities continuing down to
the present day.

Certain over-enthusiastic Indian scholars have perhaps made too much of
the achievements of ancient Indian seafarers, which cannot compare with
those of the Vikings, or of some other early maritime peoples. Much of the
merchandise exported from India was carried in foreign bottoms, and
though Indian literature mentions ships carrying 1,000 passengers this
seems certainly an exaggeration. The largest Indian ship known to Pliny,
who obtained some accurate information about the maritime trade of the
Indian Ocean, measured 3,000 amphorae, or only seventy-five tons. In the
5th century Fahsien, who had no reason not to tell the truth in this respect,
travelled from Ceylon to Java in a ship carrying 200 people, which is the
largest complement of passengers and crew attested in a reliable source
relating to early India. The few illustrations of ships surviving from this
period give little impression of size, though one, at Ajanta, has three masts
(fig. xvii); and the vessels so vigorously and realistically depicted on the
friezes of the great Buddhist temple of Barabudur in Java, are all small, the
largest containing only fifteen people. All have steadying outriggers, like
the fishing boats of present-day [Page 227] South India and Ceylon, and all
are steered by large oars—the rudder was unknown in our period.


Normally the timbers of ancient Indian ships were not nailed or riveted,
but lashed together; this was done to avoid the imaginary danger of
magnetic rocks, for the technique of nailing a ship’s timbers was certainly
known in India in the medieval period. In fact sewn or lashed timbers were
more resilient than nailed ones, and could stand up better to the fierce
storms of the monsoon period and the many coral reefs of the Indian Ocean.

An early Jātaka story30 tells of ships sailing from the port of
Bhrgukaccha to a place called Baveru, which must be Babylon. The Pali
Questions of Milinda, probably of the 1st century A.D., mentions the
possibility of a merchant sailing to Alexandria, Burma, Malaya or China. A
story of the 6th or 7th century, tells of a merchant’s son who sailed to “the
Island of the Black Yavanas” 31, which must surely be Madagascar or
Zanzibar. These records indicate the limits of Indian seafaring.

University Press).

The chief ports of ancient India were on the West Coast—Bhrgukaccha,
already mentioned, Supara, not far from the modern Bombay, and Patala, on
the Indus delta. Hence coastal shipping plied to the South and to Ceylon,
and westwards to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea until, in the 1st century
A.D., seamen took to using the monsoon winds to sail straight across the
Indian Ocean to the ports of South India. In the East the Ganges Basin was
served by the river port of Campa, from which ships sailed down the
Ganges and coasted to the [Page 228] South and Ceylon. By Mauryan
times, with the eastward expansion of Āryan culture, Tamralipti became the
main seaport of the Ganges basin, and Campa lost its importance. From
Tāmraliptī ships not only sailed to Ceylon, but, from before the beginning
of the Christian era, to South-East Asia and Indonesia.

The merchants and seamen of Roman Egypt knew India well, and there
survives a remarkable seaman’s guide, compiled in Greek by an anonymous
author towards the end of the 1st century A.D., The Periplus of the Erythrean
Sea. From the Periplus, Ptolemy’s Geography, of the following century,
and the early Tamil poems which look back to this period, we learn much of
the trade of the Tamil lands. Here many flourishing ports are mentioned, the
three chief being Musiri, known to the Greeks as Musiris, in the Cera
country (Malabar), Korkai, in the land of the Pāṇḍyas, not far from the
modern Tuticorin, and Kavirippattinam, the chief port of the Cō a country,
at the mouth of the Kaviri.

The Tamil kings did much to develop their harbours and encourage sea-
trade. We read of lighthouses, and wharves, where “the beautiful great ships
of the Yavanas” discharged their merchandise to be examined by customs
officials, stamped with the king’s seal, and stored in warehouses.

Kavirippattinam, now a decaying fishing village silted up by the river mud,
had an artificial harbour, built, according to a late Sinhalese source, by
soldiers captured by the great King Karikālaṉ in a raid on Ceylon.32
At this time Socotra had a considerable Indian colony, and the name of
the island may be of Indian origin. 6 Indian merchants were met by Dion
Chrysostom in Alexandria. One such merchant, crossing the desert from the
Red Sea to the Nile on his way to Alexandria, left a brief inscription in a
temple at Redesiye; “Sophon the Indian does homage to Pan for a good
journey”. 33 “Sophon” probably represents some such Indian name as
Subhanu, and Pan was no doubt identified in the merchant’s mind with
Kṛṣṇa, who was also a god of flocks and herds, and played a rustic flute. It
is evident that the author of this inscription was much Hellenized.

As well as merchants, we read of Indian fortune-tellers, conjurors, and
prostitutes in Rome, while mahouts often accompanied their elephants to
the West. There are records of several embassies from Indian kings to the
Caesars. The earliest of these is said by Strabo to have been sent by the king
of the Pāṇḍyas, and was met by Augustus at Athens about 20 B.C. This
mission included an ascetic called Zarmanochegas (Skt. Śramaṇācārya),
who, growing tired of [Page 229] a life of earthly bondage, burnt himself to
death at Athens. It has been suggested that when St. Paul wrote “though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing”,
he had in mind this incident of some sixty or seventy years earlier, of which
he had heard from his Athenian colleagues. The theory is, of course,
fanciful, but not wholly impossible. Later embassies are recorded as having
been sent to Claudius (from Ceylon), Trajan, Antoninus Pius, Julian the
Apostate and Justinian. The latter emperor of Constantinople had an Indian
cook.

The main requirements of the West were spices, perfumes, jewels and
fine textiles, but lesser luxuries, such as sugar, rice and ghee were also
exported, as well as ivory, both raw and worked. A finely carved ivory
statuette of a goddess or yaksi has been found in the ruins of Herculaneum
(pl. LXXXVIIb). Indian iron was much esteemed for its purity and
hardness, and dyestuffs such as lac and indigo were also in demand.

Another requirement was live animals and birds; elephants, lions, tigers and
buffaloes were exported from India in appreciable numbers for the wild
beast shows of Roman emperors and provincial governors, though these
larger beasts went mainly overland through the desert trading city of
Palmyra; smaller animals and birds, such as monkeys, parrots and peacocks,
found their way to Rome in even larger quantities as pets of wealthy Roman
ladies. The Emperor Claudius even succeeded in obtaining from India a
specimen of the fabulous phoenix, probably a golden pheasant, one of the
loveliest of India’s birds.

In return for her exports India wanted little but gold. Pottery and
glassware from the West found their way to India, and many sherds of
Arretine and other wares, mass-produced in Western factories, have been
found in the remains of a trading station at Arikamedu, near Pondicherry.34
There was some demand for wine, and the Western traders also brought tin,
lead, coral and slave-girls. But the balance of trade was very unfavourable
to the West, and resulted in a serious drain of gold from the Roman Empire.

This was recognized by Pliny, who, inveighing against the degenerate
habits of his day, computed the annual drain to the East as 100 million
sesterces, “so dearly do we pay for our luxury and our women”. 35 The drain


of gold to the East was an important cause of the financial difficulties in the
Roman Empire from the reign of Nero onwards. Not only gold, but coinage
of all types was exported to India; Roman coinage has been found in such
quantities in many parts of the Peninsula and Ceylon that it must have
circulated there as a regular currency.

There is good evidence that subjects of the Roman Empire, if not actual
Romans, settled in India. There is mention of a temple of the [Page 230]
Emperor Augustus at Muśiṟi. Early Tamil literature contains several
references to the Yavanas, who were employed as bodyguards by Tamil
kings, or as engineers, valued for their knowledge of siegecraft and the
construction of war-engines. While the term Yavana was often used very
vaguely, and, from its original meaning of “a Greek”, came to be applied to
any Westerner, it is by no means impossible that the Yavanas of South India
included fugitives from the Roman legions in their number.

Contacts between India and the West are testified in language. Even a
few Hebrew words are believed by some to be of Indian origin-notably
koph, “a monkey” (Skt. kapi) and tukki, “a peacock”, (Tamil togai). Though
the details of the Book of Kings may not be historically accurate the
statement that the navy of Tharshish brought to King Solomon gold and
silver, ivory, apes and peacocks36 shows that the Hebrews received
commodities from India at an early period. It has been suggested that the
land of Ophir, from which King Hiram of Tyre brought gold, precious
stones and “almug” trees to Solomon, 37 was Supara, the ancient port near
Bombay; this suggestion is strengthened by the fact that in the Septuagint,
the Greek version of the Old Testament, the word occurs as
; the
almug trees may have been sandal, one of the Sanskrit words for which is
valguka, from which the Hebrew word may be derived. Indian loan-words
in Greek and Latin are nearly all of articles of trade: precious stones, such
as
, emerald (Skt. marakaṭa)7 and
, beryl (Skt. vaidurya);
spices, such as
, ginger (Skt. śṛṅ gavera) and
, pepper (Skt.

pippali); foodstuffs, such as, sugar (Skt. śarkara) and
rice (Tamil
ariśi); and
, cotton (Skt. karpāśa) as well as several others.

Dubious is the suggested etymology of the word, elephant, from the
Sanskrit ibha, meaning elephant, with the Semitic definite article al or el
prefixed.



Greek loan-words in Sanskrit include several connected with
mathematics and astronomy, of which some are common, and have passed
into the vernaculars of India:
horā, an hour (
), kendra, centre (
) and kona, angle (
); two coins, dramma and dīnāra (from the
Latin denarius, through the Greek); and two words connected with war,
suranga, a mine (see p. 135), and kampana, a camp (a rare word used in
Kashmir, and borrowed from Latin through Greek); of words connected
with writing melā, ink (
), and kalama, pen (
) are certain
borrowings, though there are synonyms of purely Indian origin for both
these words. The derivation of pustaka, book, from the Greek
, is no
longer supported by competent authorities.

[Page 231] The Chinese in the Middle Ages demanded many of the same
commodities as the Westerners, but they had more to offer in exchange.

Though the Indians made splendid silks and muslins of their own they were
ready to buy the stuffs of China, and Chinese porcelain found a market in
South India and Ceylon, as did the pottery of the Muslim World, numerous
sherds of which have been found.

Though maritime trade never ceased it became more and more the affair
of foreign merchants. Indians never wholly abandoned the sea, but by the
time of the Muslim invasion travel to foreign lands was believed to incur
grave impurity for members of the upper classes, which, according to some
authorities, could never be expunged. 38 This religious objection to sea
travel was a measure of the growing fear of and distaste for the sea, which
in some degree existed at all times. Though Indian mariners were
resourceful and by no means lacking in courage, sailing the sea was always
depicted as hateful and desperately perilous. By the Middle Ages the Arabs
and Chinese had outstripped the Indians in the art of ship construction, and
it became more profitable for the merchant to sell his wares to foreign
middlemen than to take them abroad himself. The Muslim invasions
encouraged xenophobia, and the people who had planted their colonies
from Socotra to Borneo became, with religious sanction, a nation of
landlubbers.

course Kāśī (Banāras); but others were almost equally sacred, notably
Pravaga (Allahabad), Madurai, and Puri (Orissā).

RELIGION: CULTS, DOCTRINES AND
METAPHYSICS


(1) THE RELIGION OF THE VEDAS
Gods of the Gods of the Ṛ g Veda
[Page 232]
THE earliest civilized inhabitants of India worshipped a Mother Goddess
and a horned fertility god; they had sacred trees and animals, and ritual
ablutions apparently played an important part in their religious life. Beyond
this much has been said and written about the religion of the Harappā
people, but in the absence of intelligible texts any efforts at further defining
it are very speculative. The salient features of Harappā religion appeared
again in a new form at a much later date, and we must assume that it never
died, but was quietly practised by the humbler people, gradually developing
from contact with other doctrines and cults, until it gathered enough
strength to reappear, and largely to overlay the old faith of the Āryan rulers
of India.

We have much knowledge of the religion of the early Āryans from the
1028 hymns of the Ṛ g Veda, which is the oldest religious text in the world
still looked on as sacred, and which was probably composed between 1500
and 900 B.C. The. Ṛ g Veda is a collection of hymns for use at the sacrifices
of the aristocratic Āryan cult. The three later Vedas, the Sāma, Yajur and
Atharva, are of somewhat different character. The Sāma Veda is almost
useless to the historian, being a collection of certain verses of the Ṛ g Veda
arranged for liturgical purposes. The Yajur Veda, compiled a century or two
later than the Ṛ g Veda, contains sacrificial formulæ in prose and verse to be
pronounced by the adhvaryu, or priest who performs the manual part of the
sacrifice. It exists in various recensions (saṃhitā), which are of two types,
the “Black” giving the formulæ with rubricated instructions, and the
“White” adding detailed instructions in a lengthy appendix called a
Brāhmaṇa. The Atharva Veda consists mainly of magical spells and
incantations in verse, and was certainly compiled after the Rg and Tajur. It
possesses, however, an atmosphere of simple animism and sympathetic
magic on a lower cultural level than that of the Ṛ g Veda, deriving from the
plebeian religion of the Āryans and containing many non-Āryan elements.

The massive [Page 233] Brāhmaṇas, which are looked on as appendices to
the Vedas, and the mystical Araṇ yakas and Upanisads, which are in turn
appendices to the Brāhmaṇas, complete the literature generally known as
Vedic. The material in the Brāhmaṇas looks back in the main to the period
between c. 800 and 600 B.C., and the earliest Upanisads overlap with the
latest Brāhmaṇas, though some Upanisads are certainly of much more
recent date. The religion of the people who composed this literature was not
that of later India, and many scholars refer to it as Brāhmaṇism or Vedism,
to distinguish it from Hinduism, to which it bears a relation similar to that
between the sacrificial Judaism of the temple and the later Judaism of the
synagogue.

PLATE LIV
Much of the Ṛ g Veda is imperfectly understood; the oldest exegetical
work on it, the Nirukta (Etymology) of Yaska, perhaps dating from 500 B.C.,
shows that at a very early period the brāhmaṇs had forgotten the true
meaning of many obsolete words. But the broad outlines of the religion of
the Ṛ g Veda are clear enough. The chief objects of worship were the devas,
a word cognate with the Latin deus. The root from which this word is
derived, div, is connected with brightness and radiance, and the devas by
connotation were “the shining ones”. The early gods of the Āryans, like
those of the the Greeks, were chiefly connected with the sky and were
predominantly male. A few goddesses occur in the Ṛ g Veda; for instance
Pṛ thvī, a vague and rarely mentioned personification of the earth, Aditi, a
mysterious and tenuous figure, the great mother of the gods, Usas, the
goddess of the dawn, to whom a number of lovely hymns were addressed,
Rātrī, the spirit of the night, who has a beautiful hymn to herself (p. 402),
and Araṇ yāni, the Lady of the Forest, a nature goddess of little importance
who is praised in one very late hymn (p. 402f); none of these, however,
played a significant part in the cult.

At a remote period the ancestors of the Āryans, Iranians, Greeks,
Romans, Germans, Slavs and Celts had similar, if not identical, religions;
but by the time the Āryans had entered India their religion had developed
far from the old Indo-European faith. The great father god of the Indo-
European peoples, who appears in Greek as Zeus and in Latin as Ju-piter,
was known to the Āryans as Dyaus, the personified heavens, but his star
had already set. Father Heaven was often mentioned as the parent of other
divinities, but few hymns were composed in his honour, and he was
eclipsed by his children.

From the point of view of the Āryan warrior the greatest god was Indra,
who fulfilled the dual function of war-god and weather-god. Though his
name was different he had many of the characteristics of the Greek Zeus
and the Germanic Thor. As Indra tonans he rode [Page 234] at the head of
the Āryan host, and destroyed the fortresses of the Dasas; as Indra pluvius
he slew the evil dragon Vrtra, who held back the waters, and thus brought
rain to the parched land (p. 400ff). Indra was associated with storm and
thunder, and, like Zeus and Thor, his hand bore the thunderbolt ( vajra), with
which he destroyed his enemies. He was a rowdy amoral deity, fond of
feasting and drinking. One hymn, according to the usual interpretation,
shows us the drunken Indra, bragging in his cups, though it may well
represent the feelings of a worshipper who has drunk liberally of the sacred
drink soma:
“Like wild winds
the draughts have raised me up. Have I been drinking soma?

“The draughts have borne me up,
as swift steeds a chariot. Have I …?

“Frenzy has come upon me,
as a cow to her dear calf. Have I … ?

“As a carpenter bends the seat of a chariot
I bend this frenzy round my heart. Have I … ?

“Not even as a mote in my eye
do the five tribes count with me. Have I … ?

“The heavens above
do not equal one half of me. Have I … ?

“In my glory I have passed beyond the sky
and the great earth. Have I … ?

“I will pick up the earth,
and put it here or put it there. Have I … ?” 1
With Indra in his course across the sky rode the bright host of Maruts in
their chariots, singing martial songs as they aided the war-god in his battles.

They were the lesser spirits of the storm, conceived on the analogy of the
host of Āryan warriors charging into battle beside their leader. The Āryans
evidently had many legends in which Indra was the protagonist, but none of
them can be reconstructed in detail from the cryptic allusions of the hymns.

Two of his traits connect him with Indo-European mythology, for they were
applied to various gods and heroes throughout ancient Europe—Indra was a
dragon-slayer, and a wild rider of the storm. The former feature of his
character may have been a very early borrowing from Mesopotamia.

Several gods were associated with the sun. Sśrya (the common word for
sun) drove across the sky in a flaming chariot, like the Greek Helios. Savitṛ,
the Stimulator, was another solar god, a beautiful [Page 235] verse in whose
honour is the most holy of all the verses of the Veda (p. 162). Pūṣ an too
was in some measure a solar god, driving daily across the sky, but his main
function was that of guardian of roads, herdsmen and straying cattle. Viṣṇ u,
a god connected in part with the sacrifice, also had solar characteristics,
covering the earth in three paces, a trait which he retained in later
Hinduism, when his importance greatly increased. On the fringes of the
solar pantheon was Sūryā, the sun-god’s daughter, who seems never to have
been worshipped, but merely served to connect her two husbands, the
Aṣ vins (“Horsemen” also called Nāsatyas), with the sun; these are
described as driving across the sky in their three-wheeled chariot, but in the
hymns they are not closely associated with natural phenomena. They are
twins-a fact which connects them with the Greek Dioscuri and twin gods of
pre-Christian Baltic mythology. The Aśvins appear chiefly as helpers of
men; among their many good deeds they are said to have rescued
shipwrecked mariners, provided artificial legs for the maimed, and found
husbands for old maids.

The fire-god, Agni (which means simply “fire”, and is related to the Latin
ignis), was the object of much primitive mysticism and speculation. He was
the god of the priest, who dealt with him at the fire-sacrifice; he was also
the god of the home, for he dwelt in the domestic hearth; he was the
intermediary between gods and men, for he consumed the sacrifice and
carried it to the gods. He dwelt in the waters of heaven, in the form of
lightning, and on earth in many forms. He was hidden in the fire-sticks,
with which the sacrificial fire was kindled, and which were personified as
his parents. Agni, in fact, was here, there and everywhere. Was there only
one Agni, or were there many Agnis? How could Agni be one and many at
the same time? Questions like these are asked in the Ṛ g Veda, and show the
earliest signs of the tendency towards monism, which was to bear fruit in
the Upaniṣads.

Soma was a divinity of special character. Soma was originally a plant, not
certainly identified, from which a potent drink was produced, which was
drunk only at sacrifices, and which caused the most invigorating effects, as
we have seen from the hymn quoted above. The Zoroastrians of Persia had
a similar drink, which they called haoma, the same word as soma in its
Iranian form; the plant identified with haoma by the modern Pārsīs is a
bitter herb, which has no specially inebriating qualities, and which cannot
have been the soma of the Veda. The drink prepared from the plant can
scarcely have been alcoholic, for it was made with great ceremony in the
course of the sacrifice, when the herb was pressed between stones, mixed
with milk, strained and drunk on the same day. Sugar and honey, [Page 236]
which produce fermentation, were not usually mixed with it, and the brief
period between its brewing and consumption cannot have been long enough
for the generation of alcohol in appreciable quantity. The effects of soma,
with vivid hallucinations, and the sense of expanding to enormous
dimensions, are rather like those attributed to such drugs as hashish. Soma
may well have been hemp, which grows wild in many parts of India,
Central Asia and South Russia, and from which modern Indians produce a
narcotic drink called bhang.

Like many ancient peoples the Indians connected the growth of plants
with the moon, with which Soma, the king of plants, was later identified. So
important was the god Soma considered by the ancient editors of the Ṛ g
Veda that they extracted all the hymns in his honour and placed them in a
separate “book” ( maṇḍ ala), the ninth of the ten which constitute the whole.

Varuna, second only to Indra in importance, was a god of a type rather
different from the others. He is known as an Asura, a term, also applied to
certain lesser gods, which in later Hinduism came to mean a class of
demons, but which was in Persia adopted by the reformer Zarathustra in its
local form as part of the title of the great god of light, Ahura Mazda. Just as
the shadowy Dyaus represents the high god of the Indo-European peoples
before their separation, so Varuna may have been the high god of the Indo-
Iranians before the two peoples divided, one to settle in N.-W. India and the
other in the Persian highlands. The name is connected by some authorities
with the shadowy Greek heaven-god Uranus. At the time of the
composition of the Veda, Varuna’s prestige was waning before that of Indra,
but he retained some importance for many centuries.

Varuna was first and foremost a king-not a boisterous tribal warlord, like
Indra, but a mighty emperor, sitting in a great palace in the heavens, often
with associated gods around him. Most important of these was Mitra, a god
with some solar characteristics, but mainly connected with vows and
compacts. Mitra was also represented in the Zoroastrian pantheon, and,
under his Greco-Iranian name Mithras, was widely worshipped in the
Roman Empire during early Christian centuries. Around Varuna sat his
scouts, or spies ( spas), who flew all over the world, and brought back
reports on the conduct of mortals.

Varuna was the guardian of Rta, the cosmic order, a concept which was
perhaps the highest flight of Ṛg Vedic thought. The world takes its regular
course, day follows night and season succeeds season, because of Rta; man
must live according to Rta; in later days “nonrta” ( anrta) became one of the
commonest words for untruth and [Page 237] sin. Rta depended on Varuna,
who was sometimes looked on as its maker, and was thus a sort of creator-
god.

Of all the Āryan gods Varuna was ethically the highest. He was always
aware of the deeds of men, and was omnipresent, in the theistic, as opposed
to the pantheistic sense. Two men, even in the most secret of places, or at
the ends of the earth, cannot make plans alone-a third person, Varuna, is
always there.2 The worshipper approached Varuna in a spirit different from
that in which he prayed to the other gods, most of whom were lively,
cheerful fellows, whom men need not fear if they offered regular sacrifices.

Varuna was so pure and holy that the mere performance of sacrifice would
not ensure his favour, for he abhorred sin, or that which was not
conformable to Rta. The idea of sin included many purely ritual sins and
breaches of taboo, but it also certainly included lying, which Varuna and
Mitra particularly loathed, and evil deeds prompted by anger, drink,
gambling, and the influence of wicked men. When he sang to Varuna the
cheerful Vedic poet often put on sackcloth and ashes, and prayed to his
deity with fear and trembling, for Varuna was the severe punisher of sin.

Not only did Varuna punish the sins of the individual but, like the Yahweh
of the Old Testament, he visited the sins of his ancestors upon him, and his
ubiquity ensured that there was no escape for the sinner. He caught and
bound evil-doers in his snares, so that they became diseased, especially with
dropsy, and when they died they descended to the “House of Clay”,
apparently a sort of gloomy subterranean Sheol, very different from the
cheerful “World of the Fathers”, the Āryan heaven.

So humble was the worshipper in Varuna’s presence, so conscious of
weakness, guilt and shortcoming, that on reading the hymns to Varuna one
is inevitably reminded of the penitential psalms of the Old Testament. It has
even been suggested that Varuna owes much of his character to Semitic
influence—certainly not to the Jews, for the penitential psalms were
composed long after the hymns to Varuna, and as far as we know the early
Hebrews never came in contact with the Āryans, but perhaps to the
Babylonians, who often approached their gods in a similar penitential spirit.

We quote a typical hymn to Varuṇa; it is obviously the prayer of a man
afflicted with dropsy.

“Let me not go to the House of Clay, O Varuṇa!

Forgive, O gracious Lord, forgive!

When I go tottering, like a blown-up bladder,
forgive, O gracious Lord, forgive!

[Page 238] “Holy One, in want of wisdom I have opposed you.

Forgive, O gracious Lord, forgive!

Though in the midst of waters, thirst has seized your worshipper.

Forgive, O gracious Lord, forgive!

“Whatever sin we mortals have committed
against the people of the gods,
if, foolish, we have thwarted your decrees,
O god, do not destroy us in your anger!”3
Tama, lord of the dead, was a sort of Adam, the first man to die, who
became guardian of the World of the Fathers, where the blessed dead, those
who have performed the rites of the Āryans, feast in bliss forever.

Rudra (perhaps meaning “the Howler”), like Varuṇa, had a dangerous
side to his character, but, unlike Varuna, was quite amoral. He was an
archer-god, whose arrows brought disease. In this he resembled the Greek
Apollo. Like Indra, he was associated with the storm, but he lacked Indra’s
popular and genial character. He was a remote god, dwelling in the
mountains, and was generally an object of fear, invoked to ward off his
arrows of plague and disaster. He had, however, a beneficent aspect, for he
was guardian of healing herbs, and as such might give health to those whom
he capriciously favoured.

There were many other gods, such as Tvaṣṭṛ, the Vedic Vulcan,
Aryaman, guardian of compacts and marriage, and Vāyu, the windgod, who,
though important, cannot be described here. There were also demigods of
various kinds, among them Viśvedevas, a vague group of indeterminate
deities, the Maruts, or storm-spirits, already mentioned, Rbhus, gnomes
who worked in metal, Gandharvas, divine musicians, originally a single
divinity but later looked on as many, and the lovely Apsarases, comparable
to the nymphs of Greece, who might become the mistresses of gods and
men.



No Homer or Hesiod attempted to construct a definitive genealogy of all
these gods; their relationships are usually vague, and there is no tidy
scheme of precedence among them. Each god must have had his own
special devotees and priests, and the Ṛ g Veda is the result of an imperfect
syncretism of many tribal beliefs and cults. Already in the latest stratum of
the Vedic hymns gods are equated or paired together, and there are doubts
as to which god is really the greatest. In one hymn4 this important question
is asked as a refrain to every verse— “Whom, then, shall we honour with
our oblations?”; later theologians were so puzzled by this that they decided
that there was a god called Ka (Who?), to whom the hymn was addressed.

[Page 239]
Sacrifice
The centre of the Āryan cult was sacrifice. The cult of the domestic
hearth existed in many ancient Indo-European communities, and small
domestic sacrifices, performed by the head of the house, must have been as
important in the days of the Ṛ g Veda as they were in later Hinduism, but the
earliest texts describing them are the Grhya Sśtras (p. 112) of a much more
recent period. The Ṛ g Veda is rather concerned with great sacrifices, paid
for by chiefs and wealthier tribesmen. They were already complex rites
involving much preparation, the slaughter of numerous animals, and the
participation of several well-trained priests.

The chief purpose of the sacrifice was the gratification of the gods in
order to obtain boons from them. The gods descended to the sacred straw
( barhis) on the sacrificial field, drank and ate with the worshippers, and
duly rewarded them with success in war, progeny, increase of cattle, and
long life, on a quid pro quo basis. The solemn Varuna and the grim and
unpredictable Rudra are exceptional in the Vedic pantheon. Most of the
gods were good natured. Guilt-offerings and thank-offerings, of the kind
offered by the ancient Hebrews, are almost unheard of in the Veda.

Nevertheless the ceremony must have had its element of awe and
wonder. The worshippers, inebriated with soma, saw wondrous visions of
the gods; they experienced strange sensations of power; they could reach up
and touch the heavens; they became immortal; they were gods themselves.

The priests, who alone knew the rituals whereby the gods were brought to
the sacrifice, were masters of a great mystery. With these ideas, which are
explicitly stated in the hymns, went others less obvious. Often in the Ṛ g
Veda we read of a mysterious entity called brahman; in some contexts
brahman is the magical power in the sacred utterance ( mantra), but often it
has a wider connotation, and implies a sort of supernatural electricity,
known to students of primitive religion as mana. The possessor of brahman,
by a common process of secondary word formation in Sanskrit, became
known as Brāhmaṇ a, 1 the tribal priest and magician. In later Vedic times
the connection of brahman with speech became more and more pronounced,
and the brahman’s magic was thought to lie in the words he uttered. The
words and syllables of the Veda were analysed, and, though the texts were
still unwritten, the letters of the alphabet were recognized and personified
as eternal divinities. The metres used in the Veda were also thought of as
gods. Later certain syllables were believed to be particularly holy,[Page
240] notably Ṓ M (the praṇ ava), which contains the essence of the Vedas
and is pregnant with the utmost power and mystery.

A second conception, which is hinted at in many hymns of the Ṛ g Veda,
and becomes prominent in the latest stratum, is also widely known in
primitive religions-the mystical identification of god, victim and sacrificer.

From these ideas the sacrifice developed an even greater importance in the
scheme of things than it had had in the earliest period of the Ṛ g Veda. By
the end of the period it was widely believed that the universe itself arose
from a primeval sacrifice.

Though Varuna may have been sometimes looked on as a sort of creator,
and there are suggestions of Indra’s having fulfilled the same function (p.

400), there is no clearly defined creator-god in the main body of the Ṛ g
Veda. By the end of the Ṛg Vedic period, however, such a god had
developed, whether wholly from the speculations of the brāhmaṇs or from
non-Āryan influences. This god was Prajāpati, “the Lord of Beings”, later
called Brahmā, the masculine form of the neuter brahman. Prajapati was
thought of as a primeval man ( puruṣ a), who existed before the foundation
of the universe. The man was sacrificed, presumably to himself, by the
gods, who apparently were his children. 2 From the body of the divine
victim the universe was produced. The great “Hymn of the Primeval Man”,
in which the first cosmic sacrifice is described, bristles with obscurities, but
its purport is quite clear.

“When the gods made a sacrifice
with the Man as their victim,
Spring was the melted butter, Summer the fuel,
and Autumn the oblation.

“From that all-embracing sacrifice
the clotted butter was collected.

From it he3 made the animals
of air and wood and village.

“From that all-embracing sacrifice
were born the hymns and chants,
from that the metres were born,
from that the sacrificial spells were born.

“Thence were born horses,
and all beings with two rows of teeth.

Thence were born cattle,
and thence goats and sheep.

[Page 241] “When they divided the Man,
into how many parts did they divide him?

What was his mouth, what were his arms,
what were his thighs and his feet called?

“The brahman was his mouth,
of his arms was made the warrior,
his thighs became the vaiśya,
of his feet the śūdra was born.”
“The moon arose from his mind,
from his eye was born the sun,
from his mouth Indra and Agni,
from his breath the wind was born.

“From his navel came the air,
from his head there came the sky,


from his feet the earth, the four quarters from his ear,
thus they fashioned the worlds.

“With Sacrifice the gods sacrificed to Sacrifice—
these were the first of the sacred laws.

These mighty beings reached the sky,4
where are the eternal spirits, the gods.”5
By this time a new attitude to the sacrifice had developed, and it had
become a supernal mystery. By means of it the priests mystically repeated
the primeval sacrifice, and the world was born anew. Without regular
sacrifices all cosmic processes would cease, and chaos would come again.

Thus the order of nature was on ultimate analysis not dependent on the gods
at all, but on the brāhmaṇs, who by the magic of the sacrifice maintained
and compelled them. The brahman was more powerful than any earthly
king, or any god; by his accurate performance of sacrifice he maintained all
things, and was therefore the supreme social servant; by the slightest
variation of ritual he could turn the sacrifice against his patrons and destroy
them, and was therefore the most dangerous of enemies.

This is the basic doctrine of the Brāhmaṇ as, and it prevailed in many
Āryan communities in North India from about 900 B.C. onwards, and left its
mark on Hinduism in the exaltation of the brahman. In this period many of
the old gods of the Ṛ g Veda lost their greatness, and became comparatively
unimportant, while others rose in popularity, notably Visnu and Rudra; the
latter was already sometimes called by the epithet Śiva, “the Propitious”,
originally a deprecatory euphemism.

[Page 242] New Developments of Doctrine
As Āryan culture pressed further down the Ganges it absorbed new ideas
about the after-life. In the Ṛ g Veda the fate of the dead seems to have been
finally decided when they died-they went either to the “World of the
Fathers” or to the “House of Clay”, where they remained indefinitely. But
in one late hymn6 it is suggested in cryptic language that they might pass to
the waters or remain in plants. This seems to be a reference to
metempsychosis in the crude form believed in by many primitive peoples,
according to which the souls of the dead pass to an animal, plant or natural
object, before being reborn in a human body. The Brāhmaṇ a literature,
which had lost the optimism of the Ṛ g Veda, recognized the possibility of
death even in heaven.

In the Brhadāraṇ yaka Upaniṣ ad7 the first form of the doctrine of
transmigration is given. The souls of those who have lived lives of sacrifice,
charity and austerity, after certain obscure peregrinations, pass to the World
of the Fathers, the paradise of Yama; thence, after a period of bliss, they go
to the moon; from the moon they go to empty space, whence they pass to
the air, and descend to earth in the rain. There they “become food,… and
are offered again in the altar fire which is man, to be born again in the fire
of woman”, while the unrighteous are reincarnated as worms, birds or
insects. This doctrine, which seems to rest on a primitive belief that
conception occurred through the eating by one of the parents of a fruit or
vegetable containing the latent soul of the offspring, is put forward as a rare
and new one, and was not universally held at the time of the composition of
the Upaniṣad. Even in the days of the Buddha, transmigration may not have
been believed in by everyone, but it seems to have gained ground very
rapidly in the 7th and 6th centuries B.C. Thus the magnificently logical
Indian doctrines of saṃsāra, or transmigration, and karma, the result of the
deeds of one life affecting the next, had humble beginnings in a soul theory
of quite primitive type; but even at this early period they had an ethical
content, and had attained some degree of elaboration.

In whatever way the doctrine of transmigration was developed it
involved belief in the repeated passage of the soul from life to life, either
for all eternity or for an inestimably long time. It linked all forms of life
into a single system. The gods themselves must pass away, and be replaced
by other gods. As one Indra died, another was born. The souls of the
departed, though now in bliss, would sooner or later pass to new abodes.

Animals, insects, and even, according to some sects, plants, all lived under
the same law. With remarkable imaginative insight some sages taught that
even water, [Page 243] dust and air were filled with minute animalculæ, and
that these too had souls which were the same, in essence, as those of men.

The whole of life thus passed through innumerable changes.

It was generally, though not universally, thought that these changes were
determined by conduct. As one behaved in the present life so one’s status in
the scale of existence would in future be exalted or abased, and one’s lot be


happy or wretched. This doctrine of karma (literally “deed”) soon became
fundamental to most Indian thought. It provided a satisfactory explanation
of the mystery of suffering, which has troubled many thoughtful souls all
over the world, and it justified the manifest social inequalities of the Āryan
community.

To the ordinary man such a doctrine might not appear distasteful, and the
fact that it quickly obtained almost universal acceptance shows that it met
in great measure ancient India’s spiritual needs. Indeed in many respects the
idea of saṃsāra, which offers infinite potentialities of new experience to
the soul, and which holds out hope even to the humblest of living things and
the most evil of beings, might seem more attractive than the traditional
static heaven and hell of the West. But to the greater minds of the time the
thought of transmigration was not pleasant. Death was always terrible, and
the prospect of having to die innumerable times was not a happy one. Life,
even when devoid of the major sorrows, was drab and inadequate, while
continual rebirth seemed monotonously boring. The growth of the doctrine
of transmigration coincided with the development of pessimistic ideas.

Rebirth in heaven was not enough-a way had to be found to escape the
cycle of birth and death altogether. It was found, to the satisfaction of the
best minds of the times, in knowledge, achieved by much meditation and
asceticism.

Asceticism
In a late hymn of the Ṛ g Veda 8 we read of a class of holy men different
from the brāhmaṇs, the “silent ones” ( munis), who wear the wind as a
girdle, and who, drunk with their own silence, rise on the wind, and fly in
the paths of the demigods and birds. The muni knows all men’s thoughts,
for he has drunk of the magic cup of Rudra, which is poison to ordinary
mortals. Another class, much mentioned in the Atharva Veda, 9 was the
vrātya. This term, in its later broad meaning, implied an Āryan who had
fallen from the faith and no longer respected the Vedas; but the vratya of the
Atharva Veda was a priest of a non-Vedic fertility cult, which involved
ritual dancing and flagellation. He travelled from place to place in a cart,
with a woman, whom he prostituted, and a musician, who performed for
him at his rites. The status and nature of the vratyas are still [Page 244] not
wholly clear, but it is evident that great efforts were made to convert them
to the Āryan faith, and to find room for them in the orthodox cult, and they
were probably one of the chief sources of the new doctrines and practices.

By the time of the Upanisads asceticism had become very widespread,
and it was through the ascetics, rather than the orthodox sacrificial priests,
that the new teachings developed and spread. Some ascetics were solitary
psychopaths, dwelling in the depths of the forests, and suffering self-
inflicted tortures of hunger, thirst, heat, cold and rain. Others dwelt in
“penance-grounds”, on the outskirts of towns, where, like some of the less
reputable holy-men of later times, they would indulge in fantastic self-
torture, sitting near blazing fires in the hot sun, lying on beds of thorns or
spikes, hanging for hours head downwards from the branches of trees, or
holding their arms motionless above their heads until they atrophied.

Most of the new developments in thought, however, came from ascetics
of less rigorous regimen, whose chief practices were the mental and
spiritual exercises of meditation. Some of these dwelt alone on the outskirts
of towns and villages, while others lived in groups of huts, under the
leadership of an elder. Others wandered, often in large groups, begging
alms, proclaiming their doctrines to all who wished to listen, and disputing
with their rivals. Some were completely naked, while others wore simple
garments.

The original motive of Indian asceticism was the acquisition of magical
power. The brāhmaṇs claimed this already, by virtue of their birth and
training, but there were other types of power, obtainable by other means. By
the time of the Upanisads faith in the cosmic mystery of the sacrifice had
perhaps begun to wane, even among the brāhmaṇs themselves. Though
sacrificial mysticism did not immediately disappear the rite once more
came to be thought of as a means of obtaining prosperity, long life, and
rebirth in heaven, rather than of sustaining the cosmos. Indeed the wealthy
patrons of sacrifices had probably always had the former as their main
motive. In the eastern parts of the Ganges Basin brahmanism was not so
deeply entrenched as in the west, and older non-Āryan currents of belief
flowed more strongly. The sacrificial cult did not wholly meet the needs of
these lands, where firmly founded kingdoms were growing in power, and
material civilization rapidly progressing.

The ascetic, even though his penance was of the most severe type, rose
far above the heights achieved by the sacrificial priest. Once he had inured
his body to pain and privation immeasurable joys awaited him. The hermit
of the lower type had much to look forward to even on the material plane—
honour and respect which as an [Page 245] ordinary man he could never
hope for, and complete freedom from worldly cares and fears. This sense of
freedom, of a great load lifted from one’s shoulders by casting aside one’s
family and possessions, is evident in many passages of calm joy in the
religious literature of India. But there were greater incentives to asceticism
then these. As he advanced in his self-training the hermit acquired powers
beyond those of ordinary mortals. He saw past, present and future; he
mounted the heavens, and was graciously received at the courts of the gods,
while divinities descended to earth and visited him in his hermitage. By the
magical power acquired in his asceticism he could work miracles—he could
crumble mountains into the sea; if offended, he could burn up his enemies
with the glance of his eye, or cause the crops of a whole people to fail; if
respected, his magical power could protect a great city, increase its wealth,
and defend it from famine, pestilence and invasion. In fact the magic
potency, formerly ascribed to the sacrifice, now began to be attributed to
asceticism. In the succeeding age the idea that the universe was founded
and maintained through sacrifice slipped into the background; in its place it
was widely believed that the universe depended on the penances of the
great god Śiva, meditating forever in the fastnesses of the Himalayas, and
on the continued austerities of his human followers.

If ascetism had its charms even for the less spiritual, they were still
greater for the questing souls who took to a life of hardship from truly
religious motives. As his mystical exercises developed his psychic faculties,
the ascetic obtained insight which no words could express. Gradually
plumbing the cosmic mystery, his soul entered realms far beyond the
comparatively tawdry heavens where the great gods dwelt in light and
splendour. Going “from darkness to darkness deeper yet” he solved the
mystery beyond all mysteries; he understood, fully and finally, the nature of
the universe and of himself, and he reached a realm of truth and bliss,
beyond birth and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil. And with this
transcendent knowledge came another realization—he was completely,
utterly, free. He had found ultimate salvation, the final triumph of the soul.

The ascetic who reached the goal of his quest was a conqueror above all
conquerors. There was none greater than he in the whole universe.

The metaphysical interpretation of the ascetic’s mystical knowledge
varied from sect to sect, but the fundamental experience was the same, and,
as has been many times pointed out, was not appreciably different from that
of the Western saints and mystics, whether Greek, Jewish, Christian or
Muslim. But Indian mysticism is unique in its elaboration of techniques for
inducing ecstasy, and in the complex metaphysical systems built upon
interpretations of that experience. [Page 246] Where in other religions
mysticism is of varying importance, in those of India it is fundamental.

The great development of asceticism and mysticism soon became too
strong for the more earthbound and materialistic brahmanism to ignore.

Places were found for the hermit and the wandering ascetic in the Āryan
social structure by the formula of the four stages of life (p. 153f), which
first appear in the Dharma Sūtras. Accounts of the discussions and
teachings of some of the more orthodox of the early mystics were collected
and added to the Brāhmaṇas as Āranyakas and Upaniṣads. A little later
short treatises of mystical character were composed in verse, and also
appended to the Brāhmaṇas as Upaniṣads. Later still a system of mystical
training, often known as yoga (“union”) (p. 325ff), was accepted as an
orthodox element of the Hindu system. Indian religion had taken a new
direction.

It has been suggested that the development of ascetic and mystical
doctrines, especially in the heterodox systems of Buddhism and Jainism,
represents a reaction of the warrior class to the pretensions of the brāhmaṇs
and to the sterility of the sacrificial cult. This, however, is certainly not the
whole truth. Buddha and Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, were ksatriyas;
they proclaimed the futility of sacrifice, and more than one passage in the
Buddhist scriptures may be interpreted in an anti-brahmanic sense. But
many of the teachers of the new doctrines were themselves brāhmaṇs. The
Upaniṣads, which represent the thought of the more orthodox mystics, in no
way oppose the sacrificial cult, but maintain its qualified validity; and
passages speaking respectfully of brāhmaṇs are quite as frequent in the
Buddhist scriptures as those which disparage them.

There was certainly some opposition to brahmanic pretensions, and
dissatisfaction with the sacrificial cult; but behind this, and the growth of
pessimism, asceticism and mysticism, lay a deep psychological uneasiness.

The time of which we speak was one of great social change, when old tribal


units were breaking up. The feeling of group solidarity which the tribe gave
was removed, and men stood face to face with the world, with no refuge in
their kinsmen. Chieftains were overthrown, their courts dispersed, their
lands and tribesmen absorbed in the greater kingdoms. A new order was
coming into being. “[Great heroes and mighty kings] have had to give up
their glory; we have seen the deaths of [demigods and demons]; the oceans
have dried up; mountains have crumbled; the Pole Star is shaken; the Earth
founders; the gods perish. I am like a frog in a dry well”; so speaks a king
in one of the Upaniṣads. 10 Despite the great growth of material civilization
at the time the hearts of [Page 247] many men were failing them for fear of
what should come to pass upon earth. It is chiefly to this deep feeling of
insecurity that we must attribute the growth of pessimism and asceticism in
the middle centuries of the first millennium B.C.

Speculation and Gnosis
Asceticism was not merely a means of escape from an unhappy and
unsatisfying world; it had a positive aspect. It was in part inspired by a
desire for knowledge, for the wisdom which the four Vedas could not give.

Thus the growth of asceticism is not only a measure of the psychological
uncertainty which was felt at the time, but also of the thirst for knowledge.

It is not wholly just to India to stigmatize her ancient wisdom as mere “life-
negation”.

All through the first millennium B.C. intelligent minds in India were
striving for convincing explanations of the cosmic mystery. In the latest
phase of the Ṛ g Veda poets began to wonder about creation, which was not
adequately explained by the current mythology. As we have seen, creation
was thought of by some as the effect of a primeval sacrifice. It was also
suggested that it was due to a sort of sexual act; 11 elsewhere the world was
said to have originated in a “Golden Embryo” ( Hiraṇ zyagarbha), 12 the
prototype of the Cosmic Egg (p. 488) of later Hindu mythology. In one
hymn the poet puts forward the suggestion that the world arose from
warmth ( tapas, later usually meaning penance or asceticism), and then
rather regretfully admits that he is not sure of this hypothesis, and suggests
that perhaps even the high god Prajāpati does not know the truth.

This wonderful “Hymn of Creation”, one of the oldest surviving records
of philosophic doubt in the history of the world, marks the development of
a high stage of abstract thinking, and it is the work of a very great poet,
whose evocation of the mysterious chaos before creation, and of mighty
ineffable forces working in the depths of the primeval void, reminds us of
the cosmic phantasies of William Blake.

“Then even nothingness was not, nor existence.

There was no air then, nor the heavens beyond it.

What covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping?

Was there then cosmic water, in depths unfathomed?

“Then there were neither death nor immortality,
nor was there then the torch of night and day.

The One breathed windlessly and self-sustaining.

There was that One then, and there was no other.

[Page 248] “At first there was only darkness wrapped in darkness.

All this was only unillumined water.

That One which came to be, enclosed in nothing,
arose at last, born of the power of heat.

“In the beginning desire descended on it—
that was the primal seed, born of the mind.

The sages who have searched their hearts with wisdom
know that which is is kin to that which is not.

“And they have stretched their cord across the void,
and know what was above, and what below.5
Seminal powers made fertile mighty forces.

Below was strength, and over it was impulse.

“But, after all, who knows, and who can say
whence it all came, and how creation happened?

The gods themselves are later than creation,
so who knows truly whence it has arisen?

“Whence all creation had its origin,
he, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,
he, who surveys it all from highest heaven,
he knows-or maybe even he does not know.”13
In the centuries succeeding the composition of the Ṛ g Veda, however,
speculation was mainly concerned with the symbolism of the sacrifice.

“Dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse, the sun its eye, the wind
its breath, fire its mouth; the year is the body of the sacrificial horse,
heaven its back, the sky its belly, earth its chest, the four quarters its
sides… the seasons its limbs, the months and fortnights its joints; days
and nights are its feet, the stars its bones, the heavens its flesh. Its
halfdigested food is sand, its bowels the rivers, its liver and lungs the
mountains, its hair plants and trees. When the sun rises it is the horse’s
fore-quarters, when it sets it is its hind-quarters. When the horse
shakes itself it lightens; when it kicks, it thunders; when it makes
water, it rains. Sound is its voice.” 14

The symbolism of the sacrifice was carried much further than this. Every
word or action of the ritual was identified with some aspect of the cosmos.

The intellectual ingenuity spent on this process of finding pratikas or
symbols must have been considerable, but it was largely sterile. Yet the
questing spirit of the “Hymn of Creation” never wholly disappeared, and in
the 6th century B.C. it bore fruit in a [Page 249] great wave of thought which
was to alter the whole religious life of India.

PLATE LVI
The early Upanisads and the scriptures of Buddhism and Jainism, all of
which look back to the 7th or 6th centuries B.C. (though the latter were much
later in their final composition), show that there existed a bewildering
variety of speculations and theories on the origin of the universe, the nature
of the soul, and kindred problems. Some of these were accepted by one or
other brahmanic school and incorporated into orthodox belief. Others were
the germinal bases of heterodox sects, two of which survive to this day, but
most of which have long since vanished, and are only remembered in
passing references of the scriptures of their opponents.

Among the more orthodox teachings we find creation ascribed to the self-
consciousness of the primeval Person ( Puruṣ a, i.e. Prajāpati), who felt fear,
loneliness, and the need of companionship. The Person divided himself, and
produced a wife. This couple, taking the forms of animals and men, created
the whole universe. 15 The idea of creation by a cosmic sexual act was one
which played a great part in later religious thought. The theme is repeated
in various forms in later Vedic literature, in some of which tapasāthe power
derived from asceticism-is an essential feature in the process of creation-a
significant shifting of emphasis from the older theory that the world
depended on a primeval sacrifice.

Other more heterodox teachers put forward naturalistic and atheistic
cosmogonic theories. Some believed that the world began as water; others
postulated fire, wind, or ether ( ākāṣ a, p. 497) as the ultimate basis of the
universe. For some the universe was based neither on a deity nor even on an
impersonal entity, but on a principle —fate ( niyati), time ( kala), nature
( svabhāva), or chance ( saṃ gati). It was suggested that the world developed
not by the intervention of god or forces external to it, but by a process of
internal evolution or “ripening” ( pariṇ āma). Some teachers, like the
Buddha, taught that speculation on first causes was a futile waste of time.

There were out-and-out pyrrhonists, denying the possibility of any certain
knowledge at all, and materialists, who rejected the existence of the soul
and any other immaterial entity, while some teachers proclaimed that the
world was made of eternal atoms. The intellectual life of India in the 7th
and 6th centuries B.C. was as vigorous and pullulating as the jungle after
rains.

The propagators of these doctrines, even of materialism and scepticism,
were nearly all ascetics, though the literature of the time mentions more
than one king who took a keen interest in the new ideas. Chief of these
philosopher kings were Janaka of Videha and Ajāta [Page 250] satru of
Banaras, both of whom probably lived in the 7th century B.C. The forest
hermits ( vānaprastha) seem to have departed less far from Vedic orthodoxy
than the wanderers (parivrājaka), who maintained a bewildering variety of
doctrines. It was chiefly among the former that the literature of the
Upanisads developed.

The term Upanisad means literally “a session”, sitting at the feet of a
master who imparts esoteric doctrines. There are said to be 108 Upanisads
altogether, but many of these are late sectarian works of little importance.

The earlier Upanisads, like the great Brhadāraṣ yaka and the Chāndogya,
are in prose and consist of a series of short expositions of some aspect of
the new doctrines, often in the form of question and answer. The Upanisads
of somewhat later composition, like the Kaṭ ha and the Śvetāśvatara, are in
verse, and their contents are more closely integrated. Though the
speculations of the Upanisads differ very considerably, their main purport is
the same. One entity, often called Brahman, the term used in the Ṛ g Veda to
mean the magic of the sacred word (p. 239), fills all space and time. This is
the ground beyond and below all forms and phenomena, and from it the
whole Universe, including the gods themselves, has emerged.

The great and saving knowledge which the Upanisads claim to impart
lies not in the mere recognition of the existence of Brahman, but in
continual consciousness of it. For Brahman resides in the human soul-
indeed Brahman is the human soul, is Atman, the Self. When a man realizes
this fact fully he is wholly freed from transmigration. His soul becomes one
with Brahman, and he transcends joy and sorrow, life and death. In sleep a
man’s spirit is set free; it wanders through the universe as a bird or a god, it
becomes a king or a brahman. Beyond dreaming is dreamless sleep, where
the soul’s experiences are such that they cannot be expressed; and beyond
this again is Brahman. When he reaches Brahman, man is free.

In their struggle to express the inexpressible the sages of the Upanisads
used imagery of every kind. Sometimes the idea of the soul is rather
primitive, and it is described as a tiny manikin in the heart; sometimes it is
said to be the breath, or a mysterious fluid which flows in the veins; but
sometimes it is thought of as quite incorporeal and immeasurable:
“‘Fetch me a fruit of the banyan tree.’
“‘Here is one, sir.’
“‘Break it.’
“‘I have broken it, sir.’
“‘What do you see?’
“‘Very tiny seeds, sir.’
[Page 251] “‘Break one.’
“‘I have broken it, sir.’
“‘Now what do you see?’
“‘Nothing, sir.’
“‘My son,’ the father said, ‘what you do not perceive is the essence, and
in that essence the mighty banyan tree exists. Believe me, my son, in that
essence is the Self of all that is. That is the True, that is the Self. And you
are that Self, Śvetaketu!’”16
Here the soul is the inmost self of the being, in no sense material, though
ideas of a sort of soul-stuff, a subtle matter of which the soul was
composed, persisted, especially among the Jainas. The term Atman came to
mean indiscriminately “soul”, and “self”, which lends a certain ambiguity
to many passages in the Hindu scriptures.

The identity of the souls of the individual and the universe is reiterated
throughout the Upanisadic literature, with varying emphasis, and with
differing interpretations of the nature of the identity and the character of the
universal soul. Tat tvam asi, “you (the individual) are that (universal
essence)”, the words of the father to the son in the passage we have quoted,
is the leading theme of the Upaniṣads. The one eternal undifferentiated
essence, above good and evil, is in a condition of consciousness which is
beyond deep sleep (suṃupti), but is yet awake and living. Though it fills
the whole of space, by a mysterious verity which defies logic but is proved
by experience it dwells in the core of the human heart. It is generally
thought of as uniform and impersonal, and the word Brahman is of neuter
gender. Thus all the multifariousness and incoherence of the universe is
explained away, and reduced to a single entity.

“‘Put this salt in water, and come to me in the morning.’
“The son did as he was told. The father said: ‘Fetch the salt.’ The
son looked for it, but could not find it, because it had dissolved.

“‘Taste the water from the top,’ said the father. ‘How does it taste?’
“‘Of salt,’ the son replied.

“‘Taste from the middle. How does it taste?’
“‘Of salt,’ the son replied.

“‘Taste from the bottom. How does it taste?’
“‘Of salt,’ the son replied.

“Then the father said: ‘You don’t perceive that the one Reality (sat)
exists in your own body, my son, but it is truly there. Everything which
is has its being in that subtle essence. That is Reality! That is the Soul!

And you are that, Svetaketu!’” 17

The Universal Essence is sometimes defined in purely negative terms.

“The Self can only be described as ‘Not this, not this’. It [Page 252] is
incomprehensible, imperishable, … unattached, … unfettered,… it does not
suffer, … it does not fail.” 18 But, despite the negations of this passage, the
sage Yājñavalkya, to whom it is attributed, could not escape giving the
Universal Essence a degree of personality, and in one place almost
identified it with the High God.

“That great unborn Self, comprised of knowledge, is … the ether in the
heart. In that is the ruler and lord, the king of all things. He grows no
greater by good deeds, nor smaller by evil deeds, but he is the lord of all
things, the king of all things, the protector of all things.”19
In the verse Upanisads the World Spirit is described rather as a god than
as a cosmic essence.

“He encircles all things, radiant and bodyless,
unharmed, and untouched by evil,
All-seeing, all-wise, all-present, self-existent,
he has made all things well for ever and ever.” 20
In the Upanisad from which this is taken the World Spirit is referred to as
Īśa, “the Lord”. The Katha Upanisad calls the Spirit “the Person” ( Puruṣ a),
reminding us of the divine victim of the primeval sacrifice from which the
world was born. In one passage the World Spirit is mentioned with fear and
dread, recalling that earlier felt for the god Varuna:
“All things whatever, the whole world,
produced [from Brahman] tremble in its breath.

It is a great terror, an upraised thunderbolt.

They who know this become immortal.

“From terror [of Brahman] the Fire burns.

From terror [of Brahman] the Sun shines.

From fear of Brahman Indra, and the Wind,
and Death as the fifth all run away.”21
The Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣ ad, which is later than those previously
mentioned, describes the World Spirit in completely theistic terms. It is no
longer an impersonal essence, but a creator god—in fact the god Rudra, or
Siva. Rudra may be reached not only by meditation and penance, but also
by devotion and worship.

“The snarer, who rules alone in his might,
he who governs the world in his power,
is always one and the same,
though all else rise and decay….

[Page 253] “There is one, Rudra alone,…
who rules the world in his might.

He stands behind all beings, he made all the worlds,
and protects them, and rolls them up at the end of time.

“The Lord lives in the faces of all beings.

in their heads, in their necks.

He lives in the inmost heart of all,
the all-pervading, all-present Siva.” 22
This brings us very near to the religious atmosphere of the Bhagavad
Gītā, the most exalted and beautiful of India’s religious poems, which
teaches a fully-fledged theism and is part of the more recent Hinduism,
rather than of the old brahmanism, which slowly changed from a religion of
sacrifice to one of devotion.



Ethics of the Upanisads
In general the Upanisads proclaim salvation by knowledge or realization,
rather than by faith or works. Their ethics are fundamentally pragmatic.

Good and evil are resolved in the all-pervading Brahman, and are relative
terms only. From the point of view of the seeker after truth, that is good
which leads him to the realization of Brahman, and evil the reverse. Thus
anything which discourages the meditative life is ultimately bad, and among
the most serious of these obstacles are selfish desires. In more than one
context it is said that the universe came into existence through a primeval
desire of the World Soul; to attain bliss the hermit must, so to speak, restore
the state of things before creation. The normal values of the world,
sacrifice, benevolence, and even asceticism, are only good in so far as they
lead the soul upwards.

“There are three branches of the Law. Sacrifice, study and charity are the
first, austerity is the second, and to dwell in celibacy in the house of one’s
teacher… is the third. By all these one only reaches the worlds of the
blessed, but the man who is fixed in Brahman finds immortality.” 23
“The wise men of old did not want children. ‘What should we do with
children,’ they said, ‘when we have Brahman and the world besides?’ And
they conquered their desire for sons and wealth and the heavenly worlds,
and wandered about as beggars…. He who knows [the mystery of brāhman]
becomes calm, restrained, satisfied, patient and confident, and he sees
himself in the [Great] Self, sees all things as the Self…. Evil does not
overcome him, but he overcomes evil. … Free from evil, free from decay,
free from hatred, free from thirst, he becomes a [true] brahman.” 24
Occasionally it is suggested, especially in the later Upanisads, that all
desires whatever are incompatible with the saving knowledge.

[Page 254] “When all desires which cling to the heart
fall away
then the mortal becomes immortal,
and in this life finds Brahman.

“When all the earthly ties of the heart
are sundered,
then the mortal becomes immortal.

This is the end of all instruction.” 25
A life of ascetism was not absolutely necessary to salvation-even kings
are said to have realized Brahman while still ruling; but the saving
knowledge was at best very hard to obtain, and doubly difficult for one
whose mind was full of material cares and desires. All pleasure was
therefore suspect.

“The good is one thing and the pleasant another.

Both, with their different ends, control a man.

But it is well with him who chooses the good,
while he who chooses the pleasant misses his mark.”26
Though often rather negative, the ethical attitude of the Upanisads is
neither unmoral, nor antinomian. He who has not ceased from evil conduct
will never obtain Brahman. Here and there are passages of high ethical
value among the reiterated mystical similes and parables of the texts. Thus
honesty is highly extolled.

“Satyakama son of Jabālā said to his mother: ‘Mother, I want to be a
student. What is my family?’
“‘I don’t know your family, my dear,’ she said. ‘I had you in my
youth, when I travelled about a lot as a servant-and I just don’t know!

My name is Jabālā, and yours is Satyakāma, so say you are Satyakama
Jābālā.’6
“He went to Gautama Hāridrumata, and said: ‘I want to be your
student, sir. May I come?’
“‘What is your family, my friend?’ he asked.

“‘I don’t know my family, sir,’ he answered. ‘I asked my mother,
and she said that she had me in her youth, when she used to travel
about a lot as a servant…. She said that as she was Jabālā and I was
Satyakāma I was to give my name as Satyakāma Jābālā.’
“‘Nobody but a true brahman would be so honest!’ he said…. ‘Go
and fetch me fuel, my friend, and I will initiate you, for you have not
swerved from the truth.’”27

A further fine ethical passage occurs in the form of a legend in the
Bṛ hadāraṇ yaka Upaniṣ ad. We quote this passage partly because an
allusion to it must have puzzled many readers of T. S. Eliot. 28
[Page 255] “The threefold descendants of Prajapati, gods, men and
demons, were once students at the feet of their father. When they had
finished their training the gods said: ‘Sir, tell us something [good for our
souls]’. He uttered the syllable DA, and then asked them whether they had
understood.

“‘We understood’, they answered. ‘You told us DAmyata (be
selfcontrolled).’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you understood indeed!’
“Then the men asked him, and he uttered the same syllable DA, and then
asked them whether they had understood. ‘We understood,’ they answered.

‘You told us DAtta (give),’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you understood indeed!’
“Then the demons asked him, … and he uttered the same syllable DA,
and then asked them whether they had understood. ‘We understood,’ they
answered. ‘You told us DAyadhvam (be merciful).’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you
understood indeed!’
“And the blessed voice of the thunder ever repeats DA DA DA7—be
self-controlled, give, be merciful. So these three should ever be taught—
self-control, charity and mercy.”29
Perhaps the highest ethical flight of the Upanisads occurs in the
instructions said to have been given by Yājñavalkya to his favourite wife
before taking up the life of an ascetic. Remembering the double meaning of
the word ātman, “self” or “soul”, the passage may be read in two ways, but
the context shows that the Higher Self is intended. This Higher Self, the
World Soul, the mystic recognizes in all things, and loves them for their
participation with himself in the unity of the spirit. The passage is too long
to quote in full, but we paraphrase its most important parts.

“Yājñavalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayani. Maitreyi
knew something of the World Soul, but Kātyāyanī only knew what
every woman knows. When he wished to enter on another phase of life
Yājñavalkya said: ‘Maitreyī, I am leaving home. Let me make a
settlement on you and Kātyāyanī.’
“Maitreyī asked: ‘My lord, if I owned the whole earth and all its
wealth, should I be immortal?’
“‘No,’ Yajnavalkya replied, ‘your life would be the life of the
wealthy, and there is no prospect of immortality in wealth.’
“Maitreyi said: ‘Of what use to me are things which will not give
me immortality? Give me rather your knowledge, my lord.’
“‘Lady,’ he replied, ‘you are truly dear to me, and now you are even
dearer. So if you like I will teach you. Listen carefully!

“‘A husband is not dear for love of the husband-a husband is dear
for love of the Self. Similarly wife, sons, wealth, cattle, priests and
warriors, worlds, gods, the Vedas, everything—none of them are dear
in their own right, but all are dear for love of the Self.

“‘Truly you can see and hear and perceive and know the Self,
Maitreyi. [Page 256] And when you have seen, heard, perceived and
known the Self you will know all things.

“‘Where there seems to be a duality of self and not-self one sees,
smells, tastes, perceives, hears, touches and knows something other.

But when all is the Self there is no consciousness of anything other
than Self. … Thus Maitreyi I have instructed you-this is immortality!’
“When he had said this Yājñavalkya went away.” 30


(II) BUDDHISM
The Buddha
While the doctrines of the Upanisads found a place in the brahmanic
system, there were other teachings which could not be harmonized with
orthodoxy, but were fostered and developed by heterodox sects. Chief
among the teachers of such doctrines was the man who at the end of the
sixth and the beginning of the fifth century B.C. established a community of
yellow-robed followers, and was known by them as the Buddha, the
Enlightened or Awakened. Even if judged only by his posthumous effects
on the world at large he was certainly the greatest man to have been born in
India.

The traditional story of the Buddha, like those of most saints and heroes
of ancient days, has suffered much at the hands of higher criticism. The
story of his birth and early life appears only in the later books of the
Buddhist Scriptures, and even some of the references to him in those parts
of the canon which purport to give his teachings verbatim are by no means
reliable. Even the “Sermon of the Turning of the Wheel of the Law”, which
is said. to be the first sermon preached after the Buddha’s enlightenment,
and which is the basic teaching of all Buddhist sects, is of dubious
authenticity, and in the form in which we have it is not among the earliest
parts of the canon. Much doubt now exists as to the real doctrines of the
historical Buddha, as distinct from those of Buddhism. One eminent
authority suggested that they differed but little from the teachings of the
Upanisadic sages,31 while another held that he rejected the doctrine of
transmigration, and taught merely the almost self-evident truism that one
generation is affected by the deeds of the preceding one. 32 We here discuss,
however, not the life of the Buddha, but what his later followers believed
about his life, and not what he taught, but what Buddhism taught.

Certain facts about the Buddha’s life are reasonably certain. He was the
son of a chief of the Śakyas, a small tribe of the Himalayan foothills. He
became an ascetic, and propounded a new doctrine which gained the
support of numerous disciples. After many years [Page 257] of teaching in
the kingdoms of Kosala and Magadha and in the tribal lands to the north of
the Ganges, he died at the age of eighty at some time between the years 486
and 473 B.C., probably nearer the former date than the latter. The story of his
life as told by his followers is far more vivid and colourful than this dry
outline, and it is infinitely more important, for it has influenced the lives of
countless millions throughout the whole of Asia east of Afghanistan.

One night Mahamaya, 8 chief queen of Suddhodhana, king of the Sakyas,
dreamt that she was carried away to the divine lake Anavatapta in the
Himalayas, where she was bathed by the heavenly guardians of the four
quarters of the universe. A great white elephant with a lotus flower in his
trunk approached her, and entered her side (pl. XXIIIc). Next day the dream
was interpreted for her by wise men-she had conceived a wonderful son,
who would be either a Universal Emperor (p. 83) or a Universal Teacher.

The child was born in a grove of sāl trees called Lumbini, near the capital
of the Sakyas, Kapilavastu, while his mother was on the way to her parents’
home for her confinement. At birth he stood upright, took seven strides, and
spoke: “This is my last birth-henceforth there is no more birth for me.”
The boy was named Siddhartha, at a great ceremony on the fifth day
from his birth. His gotra name was Gautama (in Pali, Gotama) by which he
is commonly referred to in Buddhist literature. The soothsayers prophesied
that he would become a Universal Emperor, with the exception of one, who
declared that four signs would convince him of the misery of the world, and
he would become a Universal Teacher. To prevent this prophecy coming
true King Śuddhodhana resolved that he should never know the sorrows of
the world. He was reared in delightful palaces, from whose parks every sign
of death, disease and misery was removed. He learned all the arts that a
prince should learn, and excelled as a student. He married his cousin
Yaśodharā, whom he won at a great contest at which he performed feats of
strength and skill which put to shame all other contestants, including his
envious cousin Devadatta.

But for all his prosperity and success he was not inwardly happy, and for
all the efforts of his father he did see the four signs foretold, which were to
decide his career, for the gods knew his destiny, and it was they who placed
the signs before him. One day, as he was driving round the royal park with
his faithful charioteer Channa, he saw an aged man, in the last stages of
infirmity and decrepitude-actually a god, who had taken this disguise in
order that Siddhartha Gautama might become a Buddha. Siddhārtha asked
Channa who this repulsive being was, and when he learned that all men
must grow old he was even more troubled in mind. This was the first sign.

The second came a little later, in the same way, in the form of a very sick
man, covered with boils and shivering with fever. The third was even more
terrible-a corpse, being carried to the cremation [Page 258] ground,
followed by weeping mourners. But the fourth sign brought hope and
consolation—a wandering religious beggar, clad in a simple yellow robe,
peaceful and calm, with a mien of inward joy. On seeing him Siddhartha
realized where his destiny lay, and set his heart on becoming a wanderer.

Hearing of this King Suddhodhana doubled his precautions. Siddhartha
was made a virtual prisoner, though still surrounded with pleasures and
luxuries of all kinds; his heart knew no peace, and he could never forget the
four signs. One morning the news was brought to him that Yaśodharā had
given birth to a son, but it gave him no pleasure. That night there were great
festivities, but when all were sleeping he roused Channa, who saddled his
favourite horse Kanthaka, and he rode off into the night, surrounded by
rejoicing demigods, who cushioned the fall of his horse’s hoofs, so that no
one should hear his departure (p. 453, and pl. XXXV c).

When far from the city he stripped off his jewellery and fine garments,
and put on a hermit’s robe, provided by an attendant demigod. With his
sword he cut off his flowing hair, and sent it back to his father with his
garments by the hand of Channa. The horse Kanthaka dropped dead from
grief, when he found that he was to be parted from his master, to be reborn
in one of the heavens. Thus Siddhartha performed his “Great Going Forth”
( Mahābhiniṣ kramaṇ a), and became a wandering ascetic, owning nothing
but the robe he wore.

At first he begged his food as a wanderer, but he soon gave up this life
for that of a forest hermit. From a sage named Ālāra Kālāma he learned the
technique of meditation, and the lore of Brahman as taught in the
Upanisads; but he was not convinced that man could obtain liberation from
sorrow by self-discipline and knowledge, so he joined forces with five
ascetics who were practising the most rigorous self-mortification in the
hope of wearing away their karma and obtaining final bliss.

His penances became so severe that the five quickly recognized him as
their leader. For six years he tortured himself until he was nothing but a
walking skeleton. One day, worn out by penance and hunger, he fainted,
and his followers believed that he was dead. But after a while he recovered
consciousness, and realized that his fasts and penances had been useless. He
again began to beg food, and his body regained its strength. The five
disciples left him in disgust at his backsliding.

One day Siddhartha Gautama, now thirty-five years old, was seated
beneath a large pīpal tree on the outskirts of the town of Gayā, in the realm
of Bimbisara king of Magadha. Sujata, the daughter of a nearby farmer,
brought him a large bowl of rice boiled in milk. After eating some of this he
bathed, and that evening, again sitting beneath the pīpal tree, he made a
solemn vow that, though his bones wasted away and his blood dried up, he
would not leave his seat until the riddle of suffering was solved.

So for forty-nine days he sat beneath the tree. At first he was surrounded
by hosts of gods and spirits, awaiting the great moment of enlightenment;
but they soon fled, for Mara, the spirit of the world and of sensual pleasure,
the Buddhist devil, approached. For days Gautama withstood [Page 259]
temptations of all kinds (pls. XXVIII, LXXV). Mara, disguised as a
messenger, brought news that the wicked cousin Devadatta had revolted,
thrown Suddhodhana into prison, and seized Yasodhara, but Gautama was
not moved. Mara called his demon hosts, and attacked him with whirlwind,
tempest, flood and earthquake, but he sat firm, cross-legged beneath the
tree. Then the tempter called on Gautama to produce evidence of his
goodness and benevolence; he touched the ground with his hand, and the
Earth itself spoke with a voice of thunder: “I am his witness”.

Mara then tried gentler means of shaking Gautama’s resolve. He called
his three beautiful daughters, Desire, Pleasure and Passion, who danced and
sang before him, and tried every means of seduction. Their wiles were quite
ineffectual. They offered him Universal Empire; but he was quite unmoved.

At last the demon hosts gave up the struggle and Gautama, left alone,
sank deeper and deeper into meditation. At the dawning of the fortyninth
day he knew the truth. He had found the secret of sorrow, and understood at
last why the world is full of suffering and unhappiness of all kinds, and
what man must do to overcome them. He was fully enlightened—a Buddha.

For another seven weeks he remained under the Tree of Wisdom ( bodhi),
meditating on the great truths he had found.

For a time he doubted whether he should proclaim his wisdom to the
world, as it was so recondite and difficult to express that few would
understand it; but the god Brahma himself descended from heaven and
persuaded him to teach the world. Leaving the Tree of Wisdom, he
journeyed to the Deer Park near Banāras (the modern Sārnāth), where his
five former disciples had settled to continue their penances.

To these five ascetics the Buddha preached his first sermon, or, in
Buddhist phraseology, “set in motion the Wheel of the Law”. The five were
so impressed with his new doctrine that they gave up their austerities and
once more became his disciples. A few days later a band of sixty young
ascetics became his followers, and he sent them out in all directions to
preach the Buddhist Dharma. Soon his name was well known throughout
the Ganges Plain, and the greatest kings of the time favoured him and his
followers. He gathered together a disciplined body of monks (called
bhiksus, or in Pali bhikkhus, literally “beggars”), knit together by a common
garb, the yellow robes of the order, and a common discipline, according to
tradition laid down in detail by the Buddha himself. Many stories are told of
his long years of preaching. He returned to Kapilavastu, and converted his
father, wife and son, Rahula, as well as many other members of the court,
including his cousin Devadatta, whose heart remained full of jealousy. At
the request of his foster-mother and aunt, Kṛṣā-Gautamī, he allowed with
much misgiving the formation of a community of nuns. Devadatta grew so
jealous of him that once he even tried to kill the Buddha, by arranging for a
mad elephant to be let loose in his path; but the beast, impressed by the
Buddha’s gentleness and fearlessness, calmly bowed at his feet (pl. XXXV
a). He averted a war between the Sakyas and the neighbouring tribe of the
Koliyas, by walking between the assembled armies and convincing them of
[Page 260] the uselessness and evil of bloodshed. He went alone to the
camp of a notorious bandit, Aṅgulimāla, and converted him and his
followers from their evil ways.

Though according to legend his life was attended by many wonders, the
earliest traditions record few miracles performed by the Buddha himself.

Once, indeed, he is said to have performed feats of levitation and other
miracles at Sravasti, as a result of a challenge from rival teachers, but he
sternly forbade the monks to perform magical feats, and there is no record
of his healing the sick by supernatural means. One touching story of the
Buddha is interesting in this connexion, since it contrasts strikingly with the
Gospel stories of the miracles of Jesus. A woman, stricken with grief at the
death of her only son, and hearing that the Buddha was in the vicinity,
brought the child’s corpse to him in the hope that he would restore it to life.

He asked her first to go to the nearby town and bring a handful of mustard
seed from a family in which no one had died. She went from house to
house, but of course could find no such family, until at last she understood
the inevitability of death and sorrow, and became a nun.

For eight months of the year the Buddha and his followers would travel
from place to place, preaching to all and sundry. For the four months of the
rainy season, roughly corresponding to the English summer, they would
stop in one of the parks given to the Buddhist order by wealthy lay
followers, living in huts of bamboo and reed-the first form of the great
Buddhist monasteries of later times. For over forty years his reputation
grew and the Saṅ gha (literally Society, the Buddhist Order) increased in
numbers and influence. With the exception of the conspiracy of Devadatta
he suffered no persecution, though a few of his followers were maltreated
by their religious opponents. His ministry was a long, calm and peaceful
one, in this respect very different from that of Jesus.

The end came at the age of eighty. He spent the last rainy season of his
life near the city of Vaiśālī, and after the rains he and his followers
journeyed northwards to the hill country which had been the home of his
youth. On the way he prepared his disciples for his death. He told them that
his body was now like a worn-out cart, creaking at every joint. He declared
that he had made no distinction between esoteric and exoteric teaching, but
had preached the full doctrine to them.9 When he was gone they were to
look for no new leader-the Doctrine ( Dharma) which he had preached
would lead them. They must rely on themselves, be their own lamps, and
look for no refuge outside themselves.

At the town of Pava he was entertained by a lay disciple, Cunda the
smith, and ate a meal of pork.10 Soon after this he was attacked by
dysentery, but he insisted on moving on to the nearby town of Kusinagara
(Pali, Kusinara). Here, on the outskirts of the town, he lay down under a sal


tree, [Page 261] and that night he died. His last words were: “All composite
things decay. Strive diligently!” This was his “Final Blowing-out”
( Parinirvāna). His sorrowing disciples cremated his body, and his ashes
were divided between the representatives of various tribal peoples and King
Ajātaśatru of Magadha.

The Growth of Buddhism
According to tradition a great gathering of monks met at the Magadhan
capital of Rajagrha soon after the Buddha’s death. At this council Upali,
one of the chief disciples, recited the Vinaya Piṭ aka, or rules of the Order,
as he recalled having heard the Buddha give them. Another disciple,
Ananda, who bears a position in Buddhism similar to that of St. John in
Christianity, recited the Sutta Piṭ aka, the great collection of the Buddha’s
sermons on matters of doctrine and ethics. Though there may have been
some sort of a council, the story as it stands is certainly untrue, for it is
quite evident that the scriptures of Buddhism grew by a long process of
development and accretion, perhaps over several centuries.

A second general council is said to have been held at Vaiśālī, one
hundred years after the Buddha’s death. Here schism raised its head,
ostensibly over small points of monastic discipline, and the Order broke
into two sections, that of the orthodox Sthaviravādins (Pāli Theravādī) or
“Believers in the Teaching of the Elders”, and that of the Mahāsaṅ ghikas or
“Members of the Great Community”. The tradition of the second council is
as dubious as that of the first, but it at least records that schism began very
early. The minor points of discipline on which the Order divided were soon
followed by doctrinal differences of much greater importance.

Numerous such differences appeared at the third great council, held at
Pataliputra under the patronage of Asoka, which resulted in the expulsion of
many heretics and the establishment of the Sthaviravada school as
orthodox. At this council it is said that the last section was added to the Pali
scriptures, the Kathāvatthu of the Abhidhamma Piṭ aka, dealing with
psychology and metaphysics. In fact many of the works of this part of the
canon are of later composition, and the details of the account of the council
are suspect, but the record shows that by this time widespread differences
had developed within the Order.

Meanwhile great changes were taking place in the constitution of
Buddhism. Some modern authorities believe that the Buddha had no
intention of founding a new religion, and never looked on his doctrine as
distinct from the popular cults of the time, but rather as transcending them
—a sort of super-doctrine, which would help his [Page 262] followers
further along the road to salvation than brahmanism or Upanisadic gnosis.

This view is, in our opinion, very questionable. Though the traditions of
Buddhism give little evidence of direct antagonism between Buddhists and
brāhmaṇs at this early period there was much antagonism between
Buddhists and other heterodox sects, such as Jainas and Ājīvikas. These
sects did not merely wrangle over doctrinal points, but carried on vigorous
propaganda among laymen for their support. We believe that even in the
days of the Buddha himself the Order consciously tried to build up a
following of layfolk, who would pay to the Buddha their chief if not their
only homage. The enormous gifts which so many wealthy people are said to
have made to the Order are no doubt exaggerated, but the tradition is more
probably partly true than wholly false, and at least some of the wealthy
merchants who so liberally supported the new teachings must have looked
upon themselves as lay Buddhists. Whatever its position in the Buddha’s
lifetime, 200 years later Buddhism was a distinct religion. Aśoka classifies
all the religions of his empire under five heads; the (Buddhist) Saṅ gha, the
brāhmans, the Ajivikas, the Nirgranthas (or Jainas), and “other sects”. He
further declares that, while he gives his chief patronage to the Buddhists, he
honours and respects them all, and calls on his subjects to do likewise.36
By Aśoka’s time India was covered with vihāras, which were both
monasteries and temples. In becoming a religion Buddhism borrowed and
adapted much from the popular beliefs of the time. Its simple ritual was in
no way based on sacrificial brahmanism, but on the cult of caityas, or
sacred spots. These were often small groves of trees, or a single sacred tree,
on the outskirts of villages, and might also include tumuli, such as those in
which the ashes of chiefs were buried. These caityas were the abodes of
earth-spirits and genii who, to the simpler folk, were more accessible and
less expensive to worship than the great gods of the Āryans. The Jaina
scriptures show that unorthodox holy-men often made their homes in or
near the caityas, no doubt in order to obtain alms from visitors; and the
Buddha is said to have respected these local shrines, and to have
encouraged his lay followers to revere them.

Soon after the Buddha’s death many communities of monks gave up the
practice of constant travel except in the rainy season, and settled
permanently on the outskirts of towns and villages, often near the local
caityas. With time many of these little monasteries grew in size and
importance.

It was the cult of the caitya that Buddhism made its own. According to
tradition stśpas or tumuli were built by the recipients over the [Page 263]
divided ashes of the Buddha. Other stśpas, containing the remains of locally
revered monks and ascetics of other denominations, rose up all over India in
succeeding centuries. Aśoka unearthed the ashes of the Buddha from their
original resting places and divided them still further, rearing stśpas for them
all over India. The sacred grove or tree of the old popular cult became the
Bodhi Tree, a pīpal, planted near the stśpa to commemorate the Buddha’s
enlightenment, and an object of great reverence. The original Bodhi Tree of
Gayā, under which the Buddha sat, became an object of pilgrimage, and
cuttings of it were carried as far as Ceylon. One feature of the Buddhist Cult
which has now vanished is the column, perhaps the survival of a phallic
emblem or megalith. Such columns existed in many ancient Buddhist
monasteries, but their place in the cult is not clear. Temples proper, or
shrine-rooms, do not appear to have been erected until the beginning of the
Christian era, when the Buddha began to be worshipped in the form of an
image.

His simpler followers evidently raised the Buddha almost to divinity
even in his lifetime, and after his death he was worshipped in his symbols—
the stśpa, recalling his Parinirvāna, and the tree, recalling his
enlightenment. The worship consisted of circumambulation in the
auspicious clockwise direction, and prostrations, with offerings of flowers.

Though the more intelligent monks may have recognized his true status, for
the ordinary believer he was the greatest of the gods. This is not surprising,
for to this day Indians feel and show the utmost respect for those whom
they consider holy. It is rather a matter of surprise that it was only 500 years
after the Buddha’s death that a theology developed which gave full
recognition to this state of affairs.

With the support of Asoka Buddhism greatly expanded, spreading
throughout India and to Ceylon. There is some doubt as to how far the
doctrine had developed at this time, but at least a rudimentary canon
existed, though perhaps not yet committed to writing. The great Buddhist
holy places—the Lumbini Grove at Kapilavastu, where the Buddha was
born, the Tree of Wisdom at Gayā, where he gained enlightenment, the
Deer Park near Banaras, where he preached his first sermon, and the grove
near Kusinagara, where he died-were visited by many pilgrims, including
Aśoka himself.

Though there is a tradition of cruel persecution under Pusyamitra Śuṅga
the faith continued to grow. Of all the religious remains of between 200 B.C.

and A.D. 200 so far discovered in India those of Buddhism far outnumber
those of brahmanism, Hinduism and Jainism, together. The old stśpas were
enlarged and beautified with carved railings, terraces and gateways. All
classes of the [Page 264] community, kings, princes, merchants and
craftsmen, made donations to the Order, which are recorded in numerous
inscriptions. Though the individual monk was bound by his vows to own no
property except bare necessities, and to touch no silver or gold, the
monasteries grew rich on the alms of the faithful. The revenues of whole
villages were alienated to them by pious kings, and even the individual
monks began to take their vows of poverty lightly, for more than one
inscription records donations made to the Order by ordained members of it.

Though there is little evidence of strong sectarian animus within the Order,
sects already existed, and the scriptures had been codified in more than one
recension. It is possible that much of the Pali canon of the Sthaviravadins,
in the form in which we have it, emanates from the great monastery, the
remains of which, on a hilltop near the modern village of Sānchī, are among
the finest relics of early Buddhism.

Another very important sect, the Sarvāstivādins, was strong in the region
of Mathurā and in Kashmīr. It was in Kashmīr, according to a tradition,
preserved in China, that a fourth great council was held, under the
patronage of Kaniṣka (1st-2nd century A.D., p. 60f), at which the
Sarvāstivādin doctrines were codified in a summary, the Mahāvibhāṣ ā. It
was chiefly among the Sarvāstivādins, but also in the old schism of the
Mahāsanghikas, that new ideas developed, which were to form the basis of
the division of Buddhism into the “Great” and “Lesser Vehicles”
( Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna). The brāhmaṇs and their lay supporters had by
now largely turned from the older gods, whom they worshipped with animal
sacrifices, towards others, who were worshipped with reverent devotion. In
N.-W. India the rule of Greeks, Śakas and Kuṣāṇas in turn had thrown open
the gates to the West, and ideas from Persia and beyond entered India in
greater strength than before. In these conditions teachers of the early
Christian centuries gave to Buddhism a wholly new outlook. They claimed
to have found a new and great vehicle which would carry many souls to
salvation, while the Sthaviravadins and kindred sects had but a small one.

The Great Vehicle became rapidly popular in many parts of India, for it
fitted the mood of the times and the needs of many simple people better
than did the Lesser Vehicle, which soon began to lose ground. In Ceylon,
however, the Lesser Vehicle resisted all the attacks of the new sects and
thence it was taken to Burma, Siam and other parts of South-East Asia,
where it became the national religion.

The Great Vehicle, on the other hand, itself soon divided by various
schisms, was carried by a succession of Indian monks to China and thence
to Japan. By the time of the Guptas it predominated, and [Page 265] Hsiian
Tsang, in the 7th century, found the Lesser Vehicle almost extinct in most of
India, and only flourishing in a few parts of the West; evidently it had
ceased to make a strong emotional appeal in the India of early Hinduism.

Buddhism as a whole was already declining. In many places great
monasteries were in ruins, and places of pilgrimage almost deserted. But the
faith was still important, and had thousands of monks and many prosperous
monasteries. Chief of these was Nalanda (p. 164f), which, under the
patronage of kings of the Pala line, remained a centre of Buddhist piety and
learning until the Muslim invasion. From Nalanda the missionary monk
Padmasambhava went forth to convert Tibet to Buddhism in the 8th
century, while pilgrims from as far afield as China and South-East Asia
visited it to learn the pure doctrine.

PLATE LVIII
At this time the general standards of culture in North India were
declining. From the end of the Gupta period onwards Indian religion
became more and more permeated with primitive ideas of sympathetic
magic and sexual mysticism, and Buddhism was much affected by these
developments. A third vehicle, “the Vehicle of the Thunderbolt”
( Vajrayānaz), appeared in Eastern India in the 8th century, and grew rapidly
in Bengal and Bihār. It was this form of Buddhism, modified by primitive
local cults and practices, which was finally established in Tibet, in the 11th
century, as a result of missions sent from the great Vajrayāna monastery of
Vikramaśīla, in Bihār.

Anti-Buddhist persecution was not wholly unknown at this time. In the
6th century the HŚṇa king Mihirakula destroyed monasteries and killed
monks. A fanatical Śaivite king of Bengal, Śaśānika, in the course of an
attack on Kānyakubjaat the very beginning of the 7th century, almost
destroyed the Tree of Wisdom at Gaya. There are other less reliable


accounts of persecution, but it is certain that this was not the main cause of
the disappearance of Buddhism from India. A more important factor was
the revived and reformed Hinduism, which began to spread northwards
from the Tamil country from the 9th century onwards, when the great
theologian Śankara travelled the length and breadth of India disputing with
the Buddhists. Behind him he left an organized body of Hindu monks, to
carry on his work. The new form of devotional Hinduism made a very
vigorous appeal to the ordinary man, and the persistent tendency of
Hinduism to assimilate, rather than to attack, was always at work.

As early as the Gupta period Buddhist monks often took part in Hindu
processions. The Buddhist family, which gave its chief support to the local
monastery, would at all times rely on the services of brāhmaṇs at births,
marriages and deaths. If for a time Buddhism became to all intents and
purposes a separate religion, denying the [Page 266] Vedas, the ordinary
layman might not see it in that light. For him Buddhism was one of many
cults and faiths, by no means mutually exclusive, all of which led to
salvation, and all of which were respectable and worthy of honour. Thus, in
medieval North India, the Buddha came to be looked on as the ninth of the
ten incarnations of the great god Visnu, (p. 306f), and Buddhism gradually
lost its individuality, becoming a special and rather unorthodox Hindu sect,
which, like many others, did not survive. Hinduism, relying for its strength
mainly on independent brāhmaṇs and ascetics, and on domestic
ceremonies, suffered from the Muslim invasion, but was not seriously
weakened by it. Buddhism, by now mainly concentrated in large
monasteries, and already rapidly declining in influence, could not stand up
to the change. In the first rush of the Muslim advance down the Ganges
Nalanda and other great monasteries of Bihar were sacked, libraries were
burnt, and monks were put to the sword. The survivors fled to the
mountains of Nepal and Tibet, and Buddhism in India was dead.

The Lesser Vehicle
According to Sinhalese tradition the Pali canon of the Sthaviravadin
school was committed to writing in Ceylon, in the reign of King
Vaṭṭagāmaṇi (89–77 B.C.), after it had been finally established at a great
council of Sinhalese monks. If we are to believe tradition it had already
been sifted and codified at the three councils of Rajagrha, Vaiśālī and
Pāṭaliputra, and had been passed down by word of mouth for some four
centuries, by teachers who had not the strict mnemonic system of the Vedic
schools. As late as the 5th century A.D. written scriptures were rare, and the
pilgrim Fa-hsien was hard put to it to find a copy of the Vinaya Piṭ aka.

Probably even the codification of the canon in Ceylon did not end the
process of accretion and interpolation.

At the same time as the canon old commentaries in Sinhalese Prakrit
were also committed to writing. These were translated into Pāli, and no
doubt considerably altered and expanded, by the great doctor Buddhaghosa,
who worked in Ceylon in the 5th century. The original commentaries have
completely vanished, and some have doubted whether they ever existed, but
it is at least certain that Buddhaghosa had access to many very early
traditions not recorded elsewhere.

As it stands today the Pāli canon of the Sthaviravādins, including the
scriptures, commentaries and semi-canonical texts, would fill a fair-sized
bookcase. It consists of three sections called “baskets” ( piṭ aka), from the
fact that the long strips of prepared palm-leaf on [Page 267] which the texts
were written were originally stored in baskets. These three are known as the
Vinaya (“Conduct”), Sutta11 (“Sermon”) and Abhidhamma (”Metaphysics“)
Piṭakas.

The Vinaya Piṭ aka contains pronouncements attributed to the Buddha,
laying down numerous rules for the conduct of the Order. With each rule
the circumstances which led the Buddha to propound it are given, and thus
the Vinaya contains much early traditional matter.

The largest and most important of the “Three Baskets “is the Sutta
Piṭaka, which is divided into five “Groups” ( Nikāya):
(1) Dīgha (Long) Nikāya, a collection of long sermons ascribed to
the Buddha, with accounts of the circumstances in which he preached
them.

(2) Majjhima (Medium) Nikāya, shorter sermons.

(3) Saṃ yutta (Connected) Nikāya, collections of brief
pronouncements on kindred topics.

(4) Anguttara (Graduated) Nikāya, a collection of over 2,000 brief
statements, arranged rather artificially in eleven sections, according to
the number of topics treated in each statement. Thus Section Two
contains a discussion on the two things which a man should avoid;
Section Three, one on the trinity of thought, word and deed, and so on.

(5) Khuddaka (Minor) Nikāya, miscellaneous works in prose and
verse, some very ancient, but certainly added later to the canon than
the four other Nikāyas. Among the contents of the Khuddaka are the
Dhammapada (“Verses on Virtue”), the Theragāthā and the
Therīgāthā (“Hymns of the Elder Monks and Nuns), which contain
some of India’s greatest religious poetry, and the Jātaka, a collection
of over 500 poems, briefly outlining folktales and other stories, which
were originally intended to be told in the words of a narrator. The tales
are told in full in a prose commentary attributed to Buddhaghosa,
which is invariably published with the verses. Most of the tales are
secular, and they do not all convey a very exalted message, but they
have all been given an odour of sanctity by being ascribed to the
Buddha, who is said to have told them as recollections of his previous
births as a Bodhisattva, a being destined to become a Buddha. These
racy and vivid stories are great as literature, and will be considered
elsewhere in that aspect (p. 455ff). They are an invaluable source of
social history.

The third Pitaka, Abhidhamma, consists of a number of drily pedantic
works on Buddhist psychology and metaphysics, and is of little interest
except to the specialist. It is certainly later than the other two Piṭakas.

As well as the canon and its many commentaries there are several semi-
canonical works. Chief of these is the “Questions of Menander” [Page 268]
( Milinda-pañha), an account of the discussions of the GrecoBactrian king
and the monk Nāgasena, which is written with such literary and dialectical
skill that it has been suggested, without much evidence, that the author
knew something of Plato. Of a different character are the verse chronicles
which tell the history of Buddhism in Ceylon, and give valuable
information on political and social history also. Of these, the earliest,
Dīpavaṃ sa (the “Island Chronicle”) dates from the 4th century A.D., and
has no literary merit, but the Mahāvaṃ sa (“Great Chronicle”) of the
following century, contains passages of beauty and vigour (p. 457f). It was
continued as the Cūlavaṃ sa (“Lesser Chronicle”) by a succession of
monks down to the fall of the kingdom of Kandy to the British at the
beginning of the 19th century.

The basic propositions of this great body of literature are not
metaphysical, but psychological. Sorrow, suffering, dissatisfaction, and all
the manifold unpleasantnesses which are referred to by the word dukkha,
are inherent in life as it is ordinarily lived; they can only be eliminated by
giving up “thirst” ( taṇ hā), often translated “craving”, which includes
personal ambition, desire, longing, and selfishness of all kinds. According
to orthodox teaching the cause of this “thirst” is the innate but mistaken
conviction of individualitythat there is in each living being a permanent
core, an ego or soul. While this doctrine was subscribed to at a very early
period by all Buddhist sects some modern authorities deny that it was
taught by the Buddha, and claim that he merely taught the abandonment of
selfhood and individualism on the lower plane of everyday life, but
maintained the existence of an eternal soul. This proposition we find hard to
believe, despite certain apparent inconsistencies in the Pali scriptures. If we
can place any reliance at all upon the legend of the Buddha’s life, the
knowledge gained under the Tree of Wisdom was startlingly original, and
not a mere rehash of the lore of the Upanisadic sages, with a comparatively
slight shifting of emphasis.

Whatever the Buddha’s original doctrine, there can be no question about
the fundamental teaching of Buddhism, the kernel of which is contained in
the “Sermon of the Turning of the Wheel of the Law”
( Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta), which the Buddha is said to have
preached to his first disciples at BanĀras This contains the “Four Noble
Truths”, and the “Noble Eightfold Path”, which are accepted as basic
categories by all Buddhist sects. We give it in a somewhat abridged form.

“Thus I have heard. Once the Master was at Banaras, at the deer
park called Isipatana. There the Master addressed the five monks:
[Page 269] “‘There are two ends not to be served by a wanderer.

What are those two? The pursuit of desires and of the pleasure which
springs from desires, which is base, common, leading to rebirth,
ignoble and unprofitable; and the pursuit of pain and hardship, which
is grievous, ignoble and unprofitable. The Middle Way of the
Tathagata12 avoids both these ends; it is enlightened, it brings clear
vision, it makes for wisdom, and leads to peace, insight, full wisdom
and Nirvana. What is this Middle Way?… It is the Noble Eightfold
Path-Right Views, Right Resolve, Right Speech, Right Conduct, Right
Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Recollection and Right Meditation.

This is the Middle Way….

“‘And this is the Noble Truth of Sorrow. Birth is sorrow, age is
sorrow, disease is sorrow, death is sorrow, contact with the unpleasant
is sorrow, separation from the pleasant is sorrow, every wish
unfulfilled is sorrow-in short all the five components of individuality
are sorrow.

“‘And this is the Noble Truth of the Arising of Sorrow. [It arises
from] thirst, which leads to rebirth, which brings delight and passion,
and seeks pleasure now here, now there-the thirst for sensual pleasure,
the thirst for continued life, the thirst for power. “‘And this is the
Noble Truth of the Stopping of Sorrow. It is the complete stopping of
that thirst, so that no passion remains, leaving it, being emancipated
from it, being released from it, giving no place to it.

“‘And this is the Noble Truth of the Way which Leads to the
Stopping of Sorrow. It is the Noble Eightfold Path-Right Views, Right
Resolve, Right Speech, Right Conduct, Right Livelihood, Right Effort,
Right Recollection and Right Meditation.”’37
Though there are many difficulties in interpreting the finer points of this
short sermon its main message is quite clear-sorrow (remembering that the
Pali word dukkha covers a far wider range of feeling than the English word
with which we translate it) is inherent in ordinary life; it is due to craving
for individual satisfaction; it can only be stopped by stopping that craving;
and this can only be done by taking a middle course between self-
indulgence and extreme asceticism and leading a moral and well-ordered
life.

This very simple doctrine was developed in various rather pedantic
forms, most important of which was the “Chain of Dependent Origination”
( Paṭ icca-samuppāda), a series of twelve terms, repeated in more than one
passage of the Pali scriptures, commented on again and again by ancient
and modern scholars, and probably not fully understood by anybody. Out of
Ignorance arises Imagination, thence Self-consciousness, thence Name and
Form (i.e. corporeal existence), thence the Six Senses,13 thence Contact,
thence Feeling [Page 270] (or Emotion), thence Craving, thence
Attachment, thence Becoming, thence Rebirth, and thence all the manifold
ills that flesh is heir to.

The mechanics of this doctrine are indeed obscure, but it shows that the
craving which, according to the Buddha’s first sermon, is at the bottom of
human misery is ultimately due to ignorance—a sort of cosmic ignorance
which leads to the delusion of selfhood. The ignorance primarily concerns
the fundamental nature of the universe, which has three salient
characteristics—it is full of sorrow ( dukkha), it is transient ( anicca), and it
is soulless ( anatta).

The universe is sorrowful. Buddhists would not claim that there was no
happiness in the world, but that in some form or other sorrow was
inevitable in every aspect of life. “As the ocean has only one flavour, the
flavour of salt,” the Buddha is purported to have said, “so has my doctrine
only one flavour—the flavour of emancipation [from sorrow].” 38 In
ordinary existence sorrow cannot be long escaped.

The universe is transient. There is no abiding entity anywhere. In this
Buddhism has much in common with the teaching of Heraclitus. Every
being or object, however stable and homogeneous it may appear, is in
reality transient and composite. Man, who thinks himself to be eternal and
individualized, is actually a compound of five psychosomatic elements—
Body, Feelings, Perceptions, States of Mind, and Awareness. These five
vary from minute to minute and there is no permanent substratum to them.

The old man is evidently not the same person as the baby in arms of seventy
years ago, and similarly he is not the same as the man of a moment ago. At
every instant the old man vanishes, and a new man, caused by the first,
comes into being. Buddhism knows no being, but only becoming.

Everything is resolved into momentary configurations of events.14 The
universe is in continuous flux, and all idea of permanence is part of the
basic ignorance out of which sorrow springs.

Thus there is no immortal soul. The universe is soulless. In
transmigration nothing passes over from one life to another—only a new
life arises as part of the chain of events which included the old. Even the
gods are soulless and the World Soul of the Upanisads is an illusion. The
Buddhism of the Lesser Vehicle is therefore a religion without souls and
without god. No Buddhist teacher was rash enough to deny the existence of
the gods outright, but they are thought of as beings in no way supernatural
or different from man except in their greater happiness and power. In his
search for salvation the true Buddhist by-passes them, for they can neither
[Page 271] help nor hinder him greatly, and they will in any case do what
they can to help him if he keeps to the Middle Way.

On these premisses the machinery of transmigration—a doctrine which
was taken over by Buddhism from the general beliefs of the time—is hard
to explain. If nothing passes from life to life the newborn being cannot be
thought of as in any way connected with the being which has died, and
whose actions have conditioned his present state. Yet the new being suffers
as a result of the actions of the old one. This objection was often raised by
the opponents of Buddhism, and was countered by the analogy of the flame
of a lamp, which might kindle a flame in another lamp and then be
extinguished. If this simile was unconvincing, it was pointed out that the
old man, though not the same person as the young one, suffered illness as a
result of the excesses of his youth, and so one being might suffer as a result
of the evil done by an earlier being who was part of the chain of cause and
effect leading up to his present existence. Terms like “individual”, “person”,
and so on were merely convenient labels for a series of separate momentary
events which continued indefinitely, just as “chariot” was a convenient label
for a collection of pieces of wood and metal put together in a certain
manner.

The only stable entity in Sthaviravada Buddhism was Nirvāṇ a (in Pali,
Nibbāna), the state of bliss reached by the Buddhas and Arhants, or
perfected beings. Nirvana is difficult to understand for the humbler being
who has not experienced it, and some early Western scholars believed that it
implied complete annihilation. A statement attributed to the Buddha: “I
have not said that the Arhant exists after death, and I have not said that he
does not exist… because … this is not edifying, neither does it tend to
supreme wisdom” 39 would suggest that Nirvana was believed to be state
neither of being nor annihilation. The Aristotelian Law of the Excluded
Middle was never strictly applied in Indian thought, and a third state,
transcending both being and not-being, would not be considered an
impossibility. If the whole world was in a state of flux and Nirvana was a
state of rest this too did not present an insuperable paradox, for Nirvana was
outside the universe; it underlay it, but was not part of it.

Such a concept is not very different from that of the World Soul of the
Upanisads, and, far from being looked on as a state of annihilation, Nirvana
was described in brilliantly colourful language—“a glorious city, stainless
and undefiled, pure and white, unaging, deathless, secure and calm and
happy”.40 Nirvana has no definite location, but it may be realized anywhere
and at any time, while still in [Page 272] the flesh. The man who finds it
never again loses it, and when he dies he passes to this state forever, in his
parinirvāṇ a, his “Final Blowing Out”.

The doctrines which we have described are those of the Sthaviravadin
sect of the Lesser Vehicle, which is the only surviving sect of that branch of
Buddhism, and is today dominant in Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Cambodia and
Laos. Other sects of the Lesser Vehicle have now quite disappeared, though
they survived longer in India itself than the Sthaviravādins. Chief among
these was the sect of the Sarvāstivādins (They who say “All is”), who had a
canon in Sanskrit, and who differed from the Sthaviravadins in their view
that the constituents of phenomena ( dharmas) were not wholly momentary,
but existed forever in a latent form. Another important sect was that of the
Sautrāntikas, who maintained that our knowledge of the outside world was
only a feasible inference, and who were well on the way to the idealism of
some schools of the Great Vehicle. A fourth sect, the Sammitāyas, even
went so far as to reject the doctrine of soullessness and to postulate a sort of
soul in the pudgala or person, which passed from life to life. These early
sects of Buddhism probably gave much encouragement to the evolution of
Indian philosophy, as distinct from mystical speculation.

Though the Buddha is said to have discouraged speculation on the origin
and end of the world, Buddhists of the Lesser Vehicle devised a
cosmological scheme, based largely on prevalent Indian ideas, which
accounted for the existence of the world without the intervention of a
creator.

As in all Indian cosmologies the universe is cyclic. Over an enormous
period of time ( mahakalpa) it goes through a process of evolution and


decline, only to evolve once more. The cycle is divided into four great
periods ( asankhyeya). In the first man declines, and at last everything is
destroyed except the highest heaven; the good go to this heaven, and the
sinners to the hells of other universes, which may at that time be passing
through different stages. The second period is one of quiescence. In the
third evolution again begins. The good karma of the beings in the highest
heaven begins to fail, and the “World of Form”, a lower heaven, evolves. A
great being dies in the highest heaven and is reborn in the World of Form as
the god Brahmā. As he is the only living thing therein he is lonely. But
other beings follow him from the highest heaven to the lower. As Brahma
was the first to be born in the World of Form, and their birth agrees with his
wishes, he imagines that he is the creator of the other gods, and of all the
world, which actually comes into existence through cosmic law. Meanwhile
the earth develops, [Page 273] as well as other earths. The first men are
fairy-like beings, but gradually they degenerate and become earthbound (p.

82). The fourth period is one of continuation, marked only by a regular
pattern of comparative advance and decline, forming a series of lesser
cycles within the greater one. This process is repeated for all eternity, but
one great cycle is not exactly like the next. There are “Buddha cycles” and
“empty cycles”, and we are fortunate that we live in a Buddha cycle, in
which four Buddhas (Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa, and
Śākyamuni15) have taught, and a fifth (Maitreya) is yet to come.

The Evolution of the Great Vehicle
It is never claimed in the Pali scriptures that the Buddha was in any way
supernatural. His supreme insight was gained by his own efforts, after many
ages of striving in many different births. But his birth, enlightenment and
death were cosmic events of the highest importance, and his greatness was
such that even the mighty gods Brahma and Śakra (an epithet of Indra
commonly used by the Buddhists) did him reverence, not to speak of the
myriads of lesser deities inhabiting earth and heaven. He is reported to have
said that whoever had faith in him and love for him was assured of a rebirth
in heaven,41 a prospect which, as we know from Asoka’s inscriptions, was
much more intelligible and desirable to the ordinary man than that of the
rarefied and indescribable Nirvāṇa.

When the Buddha died, according to orthodox theory, the chain of his
existence was broken. He finally entered the Nirvana which he had realized
at his enlightenment, and ceased to be an individual, or to affect the
universe in any way. Just before his death he had told his disciples to rely
on the Doctrine for leadership. But soon after his death his followers
evolved the “Three Jewels”, which form the basic profession of faith of
Buddhism, and which every Buddhist, both monastic and lay, repeats to this
day: “I go for refuge to the Buddha; I go for refuge to the Doctrine
( Dharma); I go for refuge to the Order ( Sangha).” Though the theorists
might explain away the first of the Three Jewels, on the obvious
interpretation “going for refuge to the Buddha” implied that the Master, as
distinct from his teaching, was in some way still present, and able to help
his followers.

The Buddha himself probably taught that he was the last of a long
succession of earlier Buddhas, who had lived before him. According to
tradition these former Buddhas were revered even in the historical Buddha’s
lifetime. By Mauryan times their cult was [Page 274] widespread, and was
patronized by Asoka. In the end the orthodox Sthaviravadin school counted
no less than twenty-five Buddhas, not to speak of a large number of
pratyeka-buddhas, who had found the truth for themselves without
guidance, but had not taught it to the world.

The carvings of the stśpas of Bhārhut and Sānchī, executed in the 2nd
and 1st centuries B.C., depict crowds of adoring worshippers reverencing the
symbols of the Buddha. A little later sculptors began to carve images of the
Buddha himself, and within a few generations all Buddhist sects took to
worshipping images. Buddhism kept up with the times, and by the Middle
Ages, even in the shrines of the Lesser Vehicle, the Buddha was worshipped
just as a Hindu god, with flowers, incense, waving lamps, and deep
devotion.

Among the doctrines of Zoroastrianism, which has strongly influenced
other religions both East and West, is that of the Saviour ( Šaošyant), who, at
the end of the world, will lead the forces of good and light against those of
evil and darkness. Under the invading rulers of N.-W. India Zoroastrianism
and Buddhism came in contact, and it was probably through this that the
idea of the future Buddha became part of orthodox belief. If there had been
Buddhas before Gautama there would be Buddhas after him. By the time of


the “Questions of Menander”, around the beginning of the Christian era, the
cult of the future Buddha, Maitreya, was widespread among all Buddhist
sects.

According to the older conceptions the Buddha, in a long series of
transmigrations as a Bodhisattva, wrought many deeds of kindness and
mercy before achieving his final birth as the Sage of the Sakyas; but since
Maitreya and other unnamed Buddhas after him are yet to come, there must
be Bodhisattvas existing at present in the universe, who are working
continuously for the welfare of all things living. The Jātaka stories show
that Bodhisattvas can be incarnated as men, or even as animals; but the
more advanced Bodhisattvas, who have the greatest power for good, must
be divine beings in the heavens. Though neither omniscient nor almighty
these divine Bodhisattvas might be adored and prayed to without any
misgiving, for it was part of their mission to answer prayer, The
Bodhisattva doctrine, a logical development from the older Buddhism, thus
peopled the heavens with mighty forces of goodness, and presented
Buddhism with a new mythology. It was this which formed the hallmark of
the Mahayana, the Great Vehicle.

The Great Vehicle
According to the older doctrine the Bodhisattva works in wisdom and
love through many lives, so that he may become a Buddha, and [Page 275]
ordinary believers are encouraged to follow his example, and win Nirvana
as quickly as possible. Yet since the Bodhisattva is a being of immeasurable
charity and compassion, surely while one suffering individual remains in
the toils of transmigration he will not leave him without help, and enter
Nirvana, where he can be of no further service to the world? So, quite
logically, the Bodhisattva was thought of in the schools of the Great Vehicle
not as a being who was soon to become a Buddha, but as one who would
bide his time until even the smallest insect had reached the highest goal.

The old ideal of the Arhant, the “Worthy”, who achieved Nirvana and
would be reborn no more, began to be looked on as rather selfish. Instead of
striving to become Arhants men should aim at becoming Bodhisattvas, and
by the spiritual merit which they gained assist all living things on the way
to perfection.

The idea of transference of merit is a special feature of the teaching of
the Great Vehicle. According to the Lesser Vehicle a man can only help
another on the Way by example and advice. Each being must be a lamp
unto himself, and work out his own salvation. But the belief in transference
of merit spread very widely, even sometimes among the sects of the Lesser
Vehicle. The numerous Buddhist dedicatory inscriptions throughout India
often contain some such phrase as: “May it be for the welfare of [the
donor’s] mother and father and of all living beings.”
Moreover, the Bodhisattva was thought of not only as a spirit of
compassion but also of suffering. In more than one source is given the vow
or resolve of the Bodhisattva, which is sometimes expressed in almost
Christian terms:
“I take upon myself… the deeds of all beings, even of those in the
hells, in other worlds, in the realms of punishment…. I take their
suffering upon me,… I bear it, I do not draw back from it, I do not
tremble at it,… I have no fear of it,… I do not lose heart…. I must bear
the burden of all beings, for I have vowed to save all things living, to
bring them safe through the forest of birth, age, disease, death and
rebirth. I think not of my own salvation, but strive to bestow on all
beings the royalty of supreme wisdom. So I take upon myself all the
sorrows of all beings. I resolve to bear every torment in every
purgatory of the universe. For it is better that I alone suffer than the
multitude of living beings. I give myself in exchange. I redeem the
universe from the forest of purgatory, from the womb of flesh, from
the realm of death. I agree to suffer as a ransom for all beings, for the
sake of all beings. Truly I will not abandon them. For I have resolved
to gain supreme wisdom for the sake of all that lives, to save the
world.”42
[Page 276] The idea of the Suffering Saviour may have existed in some
form in the Middle East before Christianity, but ideas like this are not
attested in Buddhism until after the beginning of the Christian era. The
Suffering Bodhisattva so closely resembles the Christian conception of the
God who gives his life as a ransom for many that we cannot dismiss the
possibility that the doctrine was borrowed by Buddhism from Christianity,
which was vigorous in Persia from the 3rd century A.D. onwards.

The universe of the Great Vehicle contains numerous Bodhisattvas, chief
of whom, from the earthly point of view, is Avalokiteśvara (“The Lord who
Looks Down”), also called Padmapāṇ i (“The Lotus-Bearer”) (pl. LXXII).

His special attribute is compassion, and his helping hand reaches even to
Avīci, the deepest and most unpleasant of the Buddhist purgatories. Another
important Bodhisattva is Manjusri, whose special activity is to stimulate the
understanding, and who is depicted with a naked sword in one hand, to
destroy error and falsehood, and a book in the other, describing the ten
pāramitās, or great spiritual perfections, which are the cardinal virtues
developed by Bodhisattvas.16 Vajrapāṇ i, a sterner Bodhisattva, is the foe of
sin and evil, and, like the god Indra, bears a thunderbolt in his hand. The
gentle Maitreya, the future Buddha, is worshipped as a Bodhisattva. Also
worthy of mention is Ksitigarbha, the guardian of the purgatories, who is
thought of not as a fierce torturer, but rather as the governor of a model
prison, doing his best to make life tolerable for his charges, and helping
them to earn remission of sentence. Though the Great Vehicle agrees in
theory with the Lesser that the world is full of sorrow, it is fundamentally
optimistic. The world contains much good as well as evil, and there is help
for all who ask. Every living thing, from the humblest worm upwards, is in
a sense a Bodhisattva, for most schools of the Great Vehicle maintain
implicitly or explicitly that ultimately all beings will attain Nirvāṇa and
become Buddha.

The Great Vehicle was not content with creating this pantheon of noble and
beneficient Bodhisattvas. Probably developing from the old heresy of the
Mahāsaṅghika school (p. 261) the idea arose that Gautama Buddha had not
been a mere man, but the earthly expression of a mighty spiritual being.

This being has three bodies; a Body of Essence ( Dharmakāya), a Body of
Bliss ( Sambhogakāya), and a Created Body ( Nirmāṇ akāya), and of these
only the last was [Page 277] seen on earth. The Body of Essence eternally
penetrates and permeates the universe; it is the ultimate Buddha, of which
the other two bodies are emanations, more or less unreal. The Body of Bliss
exists in the heavens, and will continue until the final resolution of all
things into the Body of Essence. The Created Body was a mere emanation
of the Body of Bliss. This reminds us of the Docetic heresy in Christianity,
and it has been suggested that Docetism and the doctrine of the Three
Bodies owe much to a common gnostic source.

The Buddha’s Body of Bliss is the presiding deity of the most important
Mahayana heaven, Sukhavati, the “Happy Land”, where the blessed are
reborn in the buds of lotuses, which rise from a lovely lake before the
Buddha’s throne. This divine Buddha is usually called Amitābha
(Immeasurable Glory), or Amitāyus (Immeasurable Age). He too shares the
compassion of the Bodhisattva, for, though he enjoys endless and infinite
bliss, he maintains an interest in his world, and especially in his heaven. At
his touch the lotuses open, to give birth to the blessed, who are nourished
and grow through the food of his word. According to some Chinese and
Japanese sects whoever calls on his name, however sinful he may have
been, is assured of rebirth in his heaven. Amitabha is, in fact, a Father in
Heaven. He, the historical Gautama Buddha, and the Bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara are closely associated, and play a bigger part in Mahayanist
thought than do other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, because they are chiefly
concerned with this region of the universe and this period of cosmic time,
but there are many other heavenly Buddhas, presiding over other heavens
and other universes. All are emanations of the primal Body of Essence,
which is no other than the Brahman, the World Soul or Absolute of the
Upanisads, in new guise. The Body of Essence is sometimes referred to in
later Buddhist writings as Ādi Buddha, the Primeval Buddha, and is also
described as the Void ( Sunya), the True ( Tattva), Wisdom ( Bodhi), or the
Womb of those who Attain the Goal ( Tathagatagarbha). Moreover it is
Nirvāṇa. The final state, which the Sthaviravadin school found so difficult
to describe in words, was, for most sects of the Great Vehicle, not really
different from the mystical union with the absolute Brahman of the
Upaniṣads. The wheel turned full circle, and the mystical monism which
early Buddhism so strongly opposed found its way into later Buddhism, but
with a new terminology.

Most Buddhist sects of both Vehicles had their own versions of the
Pitakas, but, with the exception of the Pali Pitakas of the Sthaviravadins,
these have not survived in entirety, and in most of the schools of the Great
Vehicle their place was largely taken by later [Page 278] texts, mostly
composed in the early centuries of the Christian era. These are in Sanskrit,
which became the official language of the Great Vehicle in India, though in
other parts of Asia it tended to prefer the local vernacular. Many of these
texts are ostensibly sermons of the Buddha, but of much greater length than
those of the Sutta Piṭaka; hence they were known as Vaipulya Sūtras
(“Expanded Sermons”).

Among the earliest Mahayana texts is the Lalitavistara, a flowery
narrative of the life of the Buddha, containing much more of the
supernatural and the marvellous than the Pali account; this text was utilized
by Sir Edwin Arnold for The Light of Asia, a lengthy poem on the Buddha’s
life which enjoyed much popularity at the end of the last century, and is still
readable, though its style has somewhat dated. Other important scriptures
are the Saddharmapuṇṭ arīka (“The Lotus of the Good Law”), a long series
of dialogues of considerable literary merit; the Vajracchedika (“Diamond
Cutter”), containing important metaphysical writing; the Sukhāvatīvyūha,
describing the glories of Amitabha and his paradise; the Karaṇḍ avyūha,
glorifying Avalokiteśvara; and the Aṣṭ asahasrikaprajñāpāramitā, a
workdescribing the spiritual perfections of the Bodhisattvas (p. 276, n).

Literature on this latter subject was considerable. As well as these sacred
texts the Great Vehicle produced much religious poetry and a great deal of
sectarian philosophical literature, some of very high merit.

The Sthaviravadin commentators were perhaps hampered by the
Buddha’s injunctions against unnecessary speculation, and, though they
could on occasion argue very logically, they produced few works of
systematic philosophy. The Great Vehicle, on the other hand, produced
many. It had two chief philosophical schools, the Mādhyamika and the
Yogācāra.

The Mādhyamika (“Intermediate”) School, so called because it took a
line midway between the uncompromising realism of the Sarvastivadins
and the idealism of the Yogācāra, looked back to one of India’s greatest
philosophers, Nāgārjuna, who, according to tradition, was a contemporary
of Kaniska, and whose Mādhyamika Kārikā formed the basic text of the
school. We have seen that, in almost all Buddhist sects, the universe was
believed to be a flux of momentary but interdependent events ( dharma).

Nāgārjuna showed by very subtle arguments that on final analysis the
cosmic flux was unreal, as was the consciousness which perceived it, and
which was itself part of the flux. Therefore Samsara, the immeasurably long
process of transmigration, did not really exist. If the world of change was


unreal, its contrary, Nirvana, was also unreal. There was therefore [Page
279] no difference between Saṃsāra and Nirvana, which were one and the
same in their common nonentity. In fact if all things were equally unreal,
they were on ultimate analysis one and the same. The One Thing which
alone had real existence could have no predicate it was therefore called by
Nāgārjuna “Emptiness”, or “the Void” ( Śūnyatā).

This philosophical nihilism did not lead Nāgārjuna and his followers to
scepticism or agnosticism. Though nothing but the Void was wholly real,
the world and all that it contained, from Amitabha downwards, had a
qualified practical reality; and the great Void underlying all the universe
was, in fact, the Body of Essence itself, the Primeval Buddha, Nirvāṇa.

Final immeasurable bliss was here and now for all who would perceive it—
not something remote and cold, but the very breath of life, nearer and more
real than one’s own heart. “The life of the world is the same as Nirvana…,”
said the Madhyamikas, “and really there is no difference between them at
all”. 43
The Yogācāra (“Way of Union”) or Vijndnavddin School completely
rejected the realism of the Lesser Vehicle, and maintained a thorough-going
idealism, not even allowing the qualified realism of the Mādhyamikas. The
world was built by the consciousness, and had no more reality than a dream.

The only reality was “Suchness” ( Tathātā), also called Dharmadhātu (freely
translated “the Raw Material of Phenomena”), which was equivalent to
Nāgārjuna’s Void. The Yogacara school, though perhaps less influential
than the Madhyamika, produced many important philosophers and
logicians. Chief of these were Asaṅga, a monk of Peshāwar of the 4th or
5th century, whose Sūtrālaṅ kāra is the earliest text of the school,
Vasubandhu, the younger brother of Asaṅga, and the great logicians
Dignāga and Dharmakirti. Among the most important writings of Yogācāra
is the Lankāvatāra Sūtra, a lengthy text of great subtlety.

The Vehicle of the Thunderbolt
Quite early in the history of the Great Vehicle feminine divinities found
their way into the pantheon. One such was Prañāpāramitā, the Perfection of
Insight, the personification of the qualities of the Bodhisattva. Later, the
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, who were thought of as male, were, like the
gods of Hinduism, endowed with wives, who were the active aspect, the
“force” or “potency” ( sakti) of their husbands. The god was thought of as
transcendent and aloof, while the goddess was active in the world; thus the
god might be best approached through the goddess. The productive activity
of the divine was thought of in terms of sexual union, an [Page 280] idea as
old as the Ṛ g Veda. With the spread of these ideas sexual symbolism, and
even sexual intercourse as a religious rite, were incorporated into the
teachings of some schools of both Hinduism and Buddhism.

With these ideas was combined a new magical mysticism. The Lesser
Vehicle taught that release was obtained by the gradual loss of individuality
through self-discipline and meditation; the Great Vehicle added that the
grace and help of the heavenly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas assisted the
process. The followers of the new teachings taught that it could be best
attained by acquiring magical power, which they called vajra (thunderbolt,
or diamond). Hence the new school of Buddhism was called Vajrayāna, the
Vehicle of the Thunderbolt.

Even the Sthaviravādins taught that the monk who reached a high stage
of detachment and mental training acquired supernatural powers. At all
times there were free-lance Buddhist monks, who did not live regularly in
monasteries under orthodox discipline, and who attempted feats of sorcery
and necromancy, such as the Buddha is said to have condemned. It was
perhaps among these free-lances that the ideas of the new Vehicle
developed, to be codified and given dignity under the Pala kings of Bengal
and Bihār. Even in the 7th century Hsüan Tsang found certain monasteries
permeated with magical practices.

The chief divinities of the new sect were the “Saviouresses” ( Tārās), the
spouses of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. There were also a host of lesser
divinities, many called by the names of demons, such as “outcaste women”
( matangis), demonesses ( pisacis), sorceresses ( yogin īs), and she-ghouls
(ṭ ākinīs). The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with their Tārās were
approximated to the less amiable members of the Hindu pantheon, and were
often depicted with many arms in ferocious poses.

As in the days of the brahmans, it was thought that these deities should
be compelled rather than persuaded. The textbooks outlining the means of
doing this ( sādhana) were called Tantras, and hence the new cult is often
referred to as tantric. By pronouncing the right formula ( mantra) in the
correct manner, or by drawing the correct magical symbol ( yantra), one

might force the gods to bestow magical power on the worshipper and lead him to the highest bliss. Among the many formulæ of tantric Buddhism one is specially famous—the “Six Syllables” Ṣ aḍ akṣ arā), Ṑ m maṇ i padme hūm, still written and repeated thousands of times daily in Tibet. This phrase: “Ah! the jewel is indeed in the lotus!”, may be sexual in significance, mystically repeating the divine coitus of the heavenly Buddha and Prajñāpāramitā, and of Avalokiteśvara and his Tārā.

PLATE LX
[Page 281] Tantric Buddhism did not neglect the techniques of mental
training which were part of all the chief religions of India, but their
direction was altered. Their primary purpose was to obtain supernormal
power. The meditations of the Vajrayana were often positively
psychopathic. The practitioner of the system might so hypnotize himself as
to imagine that he was reborn from the womb of a Tara, to kill his father the
Buddha and take his place. In sexual union with a female devotee he and his
partner would become Buddha and Tara, or he himself might become Tara.

In the sexual rites of tantric Buddhism all taboos were lifted. Even incest
was permitted, for what was sin to the ignorant was virtue to the initiate.

Drinking of alcohol, meat—eating, killing of animals, and sometimes even
of human beings—every imaginable sin—were practised at the tantric
covens. These things were, however, done under strict control, and only by
initiates at sacred ceremonies. Like the Bengali tantricist of later times the
Vajrayana initiate might in his ordinary life be a normal man, whose
occasional religious debauchery served as a catharsis to his evil
psychological propensities and was of real help to him in leading the good
life as he understood it.

The Buddhist Order
Membership of the Buddhist Order was not restricted by caste, but
slaves, soldiers, debtors, and other persons under obligation or in tutelage
might not enter it without the permission of their superior. Novices might be
admitted from the age of eight upwards, but they could only qualify for full
membership of the Order after a long course of study, at the minimum age
of twenty. The rites of admission were simple, involving putting on the
three yellow or orange robes of the Order, ceremonially shaving the head,
and pronouncing the Three Jewels (p. 273) and the “Ten Precepts”. The
latter form a sort of Buddhist decalogue:
(1) “I accept the precept to refrain from harming living beings.

(2) “I accept the precept to refrain from taking what is not given.

(3) “… from evil behaviour in passion.

(4) “… from false speech.

(5) “… from surā, meraya and majjā (alcoholic drinks), which cause
carelessness.

(6) “… from eating at forbidden times (i.e. after midday).

(7) “… from dancing, singing, music and dramatic performances.

(8) “… from the use of garlands, perfumes, unguents and jewellery.

(9) “… from the use of a high or broad bed.

(10) “… from receiving gold and silver.” 20
[Page 282] These precepts were not lifelong vows, but earnest resolves.

They were repeated regularly, and if any monk felt that he could no longer
honestly maintain them he might leave the Order quite freely, though public
opinion tended to frown on the backslider. The vows were often taken for a
definite duration only, as is still done in Burma, where boys on leaving
school often spend some months in a monastery in preparation for adult life.

In this the Buddhist Order sharply contrasts with Christian monasticism.

Of the ten vows the first did not originally involve complete
vegetarianism, though it came to do so in many Buddhist communities. A
monk might eat meat if the animal providing it was not specially killed for
his benefit. The third vow, for the monk, meant absolute celibacy. The fifth
was generally taken to mean abstention from all intoxicants. By the sixth, a
monk might eat no solid food after midday; this, in a warm climate and for
a man not engaged in strenuous work, was no very great hardship,
especially as the monk might take sweetened beverages at any time. In
colder climates, such as that of Tibet, monks often take an evening meal,
which is looked on as medicine. The seventh rule was not taken to include
singing and music for liturgical or other religious purposes. The tenth was
interpreted very liberally in many monasteries. Strictly a monk might own
only eight “requisites”—three robes, a waist-cloth, an alms-bowl, a razor, a
needle, and a cloth to strain his drinking-water in order to save the lives of
any animalculæ it might contain. In fact he often owned much more than
this by the convenient fiction, not unknown in some Christian religious
communities, that his property belonged to the Order, from which he had it
on loan.

The monk had to beg his food from door to door every morning, taking it
back to his monastery for his midday meal. As the monasteries became
wealthy, however, the begging round was often reduced to a mere formality,
or dropped altogether.

While the Buddhist monk resembled his Christian counterpart in his
vows of chastity and poverty, he took no vow of obedience. Each novice or
junior monk had his preceptor, and was expected to treat him with great
respect, but the monk was essentially a free member of a community of free
men. There was no central authority to regulate the many monasteries and
enforce uniformity; each was a law unto itself, guided only by the precepts
of the Master as it had received them, and as it interpreted them. The
constitution of the monastery had elements of democracy about it. The chief
monk, or abbot, was not appointed from above or nominated by his
predecessor, but held office by the suffrage of all the monks in the monastic
parish. The day-to-day business of the monastery was managed by [Page
283] a committee of elder monks, and important decisions, such as the
admission or expulsion of members, could only be made by the committee
and not by the chief. Important business was discussed at meetings of the
whole monastery in chapter (p. 97).

The monks assembled every fortnight on the evenings of the full and new
moons for upavasatha (in Pāli, uposatha), an act of general confession. The
long list of monastic rules ( Prātimokṣ a, in Pāli Pātimokkha) from the
Vinaya Piṭ aka was read, and each monk confessed any breaches which he
had committed during the preceding fortnight. If his fault was serious his
case was referred to a committee of elders, which might impose penance or
expel him from the Order. The ceremony concluded with the preaching of
sermons, to which the pious layfolk of the vicinity listened.

The daily life of the monk was chiefly spent in study and religious
exercises, but he was expected to take his share in the work of the
monastery, cleaning his cell, and sweeping the courtyard and the monastic


buildings, while the elder monks devoted much of their time to teaching the
novices. Among the most important of the monk’s spiritual exercises were
the Four Sublime Moods ( Brahmavihāra), in which, sitting quietly cross-
legged, he endeavoured to fill his mind with the four cardinal virtues of
Buddhism—love, pity, joy, and serenity-and to consider all living beings in
the light of these virtues. A fifth mood was that of impurity, in which he
considered all the vileness and horror of the world and of the life of the
flesh. For those more advanced in sanctity there were more advanced
meditations, which brought the monk very near to the realization of
Nirvāna.

One aspect of the monk’s mental discipline which deserves mention is the seventh element of the “Noble Eightfold Path” (p. 269)—“Right Recollection”. He was taught to train himself to be continually aware of what he was doing, observing himself, as it were, all the time. Every act must be fully conscious, and distraction, carelessness, and lack of consideration were serious faults. When he ate, the monk should be aware of the nature of the act, its purpose, and the transience of the body which he fed, and similarly with every act throughout the day. No doubt few but the most advanced monks were able to keep up this state of “Right Recollection” continuously.
At one time India possessed numerous Buddhist nunneries, though nowmonastic life in Buddhism is confined to men, except in Tibet. The nunswore yellow robes and shaved their heads like the monks, and theirdiscipline was very similar. Though strict rules were laid down forpreserving the respectability of the two branches of the Order, which oftendwelt in adjoining establishments, accusations of [Page 284] immoralitywere sometimes levelled against them by their religious opponents, andthese accusations may have had some foundation. The sexual activity oftantric Buddhism, of course, did notconstituteabreach of the vows, whenperformed in accordance with the rites of the sect.Buddhist Ethics and MoralityBuddhism inculcates a high system of ethics. The Noble Eightfold Path,whereby a man attains Nirvana, is not merely a matter of belief orknowledge, but also of conduct, and the Four Cardinal Virtues of Buddhism(p. 283) are more positive in character than the nonviolenceandabstinenceof the Upaniṣads.The chief of these virtues, love (Pāli, mettā, Sanskrit, maitrī), issomewhat less tinged with emotion than the comparable virtue inChristianity. The term is derived from the word mitra, “a friend”, and mightbe translated “friendliness”, “good will” or “benevolence”. Nevertheless theBuddhist scriptures contain passages which describe mettā with a passionwhich recalls the famous words of St. Paul on the virtue of charity.

“May every living being, weak or strong, large or small, seen or unseen,
near or far, born or yet unborn—may every living thing be full of joy.

“May none deceive another, or think ill of him in any way whatever, or in anger or ill-will desire evil for another.

“Just as a mother, as long as she lives, cares for her only child, so should a man feel all-embracing love to all living beings.

“He should feel boundless love for all the world, above below and across, unrestrained, without enmity. Standing, walking, sitting or lying down,… he should be firm in the mindfulness of love. For this is what men call the Sublime Mood.” 44
In this connexion the following extract is interesting, for it recalls a well- known verse of the Sermon on the Mount.

“A man buries a treasure in a deep pit, thinking: ‘It will be useful in time of need, or if the king is displeased with me, or if I am robbed, or fall into debt, or if food is scarce, or bad luck befalls me.’ “But all this treasure may not profit the owner at all, for he may forget where he hid it, or goblins may steal it, or his enemies or even his kinsmen may take it when he is not on his guard.

“But by charity, goodness, restraint and self-control man and woman alike can store up a well-hidden treasure—a treasure which cannot be given to others,17 and which robbers cannot steal. A wise man should do good thatis the treasure which will not leave him.”45[Page 285] Though the passages quoted above cannot be dated with precision they are certainly pre-Christian, and there is no possibility of Christian influence.
The vow of the Bodhisattva, which we have already quoted (p. 275),gives sufficient indication of the ethics of the Great Vehicle, which teaches an impassioned altruism scarcely to be found elsewhere in the literature of the non-Christian world. Though the Buddhist virtue of mettā seems often rather a state of mind than a spur to benevolent action, the view that faith without works is dead is sometimes expressed, notably in the story of the Buddha and the sick monk.

As the Master was going on a round of inspection, visiting the monks in their cells, he found one who was sick with dysentery, and who had fallen from his bed and lay in his own ordure. With his own hands the Buddhawashed the sick man from head to foot, laid him comfortably on his bed,and gave a new rule to the Order:“Brethren, you have no mother or father to care for you. If you do not care for one another who else will do so? Brethren, he who would care forme should care for the sick.” 46
Though this precept applies primarily to the Order of monks, it was nodoubt under the influence of such teachings that Aśoka established free hospitals, and that Buddhist monks have at all times studied medical lore,and treated laymen as well as their own fellows.

The Buddhist scriptures were chiefly written for and addressed to the monks and nuns of the order, but a number of passages gave special instruction to the layman, and the first five of the “Ten Precepts” (p. 281)were binding on the lay community. According to the first of these noBuddhist could follow the profession of hunter or butcher. The vow not to take life was not generally interpreted as forbidding lawful warfare or thesentencing of criminals to death, and did not preclude Buddhists fromeating meat, if provided by non Buddhist butchers. But Buddhism tended toencourage mildness in justice and vegetarianism, and somewhat discouraged the militarism which prevailed at most periods in ancient India(p. 123). _The second precept, not to take what is not given, included abstention not only from theft, but also from sharp practice in business._

For the laymen the third precept did not, of course, involve absolute celibacy, but permitted lawful marriage. It was usually interpreted as forbidding unnatural sexuality and extra-marital relations. Buddhism laid down no hard and fast rules on the questions of marriage and divorce, and at the present day in Buddhist countries marital laws are largely influenced by local custom. The fourth [Page 286] precept, forbidding false speech,was taken to include lying, perjury and slander, while the fifth forbadealcoholic drinks. Modern Buddhists often put a rather liberal interpretationon this rule, and the same may have been done in ancient days, for in one sermon the Buddha is said to have classed only the first four sins as “vices of action”, and to have included drinking among the six less reprehensible“openings for the swallowing up of wealth”, the others being roaming the streets at unseasonable hours, frequenting festivals, gambling, keeping bad company and idling.

This sermon, the most important Buddhist text on lay morality, is the “Address to Sigala”, 47 in which the Buddha gives instruction to a young layman on his relations with his fellow men, and on the duties of parentsand children, teachers and pupils, husbands and wives, and friends. It breathes a spirit of warm affection and fellowship, not raised to an exalted spiritual level, but of an everyday practical type. The text is too long to quote, and we can only summarize some of its instructions.

Husbands should respect their wives, and comply as far as possible with their requests. They should not commit adultery. They should give their wives full charge of the home, and supply them with fine clothes and jewellery as far as their means permit. Wives should be thorough in their duties, gentle and kind to the whole household, chaste, and careful in housekeeping, and should carry out their work with skill and enthusiasm.

A man should be generous to his friends, speak kindly of them, act in their interest in every way possible, treat them as his equals, and keep his word to them. They in turn should watch over his interests and property,take care of him when he is “off his guard” (i.e. intoxicated, infatuated, or otherwise liable to commit rash and careless actions), stand by him and help him in time of trouble, and respect other members of his family.

Employers should treat their servants and workpeople decently. They should not be given tasks beyond their strength. They should receiveadequate food and wages, be cared for in time of sickness and infirmity, andbe given regular holidays and bonuses in times of prosperity. They shouldrise early and go to bed late in the service of their master, be content withtheir just wages, work thoroughly, and maintain their master’s reputation.

Precepts such as these, which are implicit in the teaching of other religions, are nowhere else so clearly and unequivocally expressed.

Specially noteworthy are the duties of husbands to wives and of masters to servants, which seem to anticipate twentieth century ideas on the rights of women and employees.

Among the most important vehicles of Buddhist ethical teaching are the Jataka stories. These are mostly of secular origin, and many [Page 287] merely inculcate shrewdness and caution in everyday life, as do Æsop’sfables [[Æsop's fables]] (e.g. that given in full on p. 454f). Others teach generosity and self-abnegation in morbidly exaggerated forms, for instance the tale of KingŚivi (known also in Hinduism), who ransomed a pigeon from a famished hawk with flesh cut from his own thigh. Many European readers might well find the very popular story of Prince Visvantara (Pali, Vessantara) distasteful. This prince gave away so much of his royal father’s treasure that he was banished with his wife and children in a carriage drawn by fourhorses. As he left, he gave away the carriage and horses for the asking, and settled in a hut in the forest with his family. Soon he gave his children to a wandering ascetic who needed them to do his begging for him, and finally he disposed of his wife in similar manner. But all ended happily, for those who had asked him for his most precious possessions were gods in disguise,who had decided to test his generosity, and he was at last restored to his family and his patrimony (pl. XXVIII). But many of these old Buddhist stories are of the highest ethical quality, such as that of the monkey who saved the lives of his fellows from the king’s archers at the risk of his own by making himself a living bridge over the Ganges, or that of the noble parrot, who laid down his life for his friends, in a futile attempt to quench aforest fire by drops of water scattered from his wings.


## (III) JAINISM AND OTHER UNORTHODOX SECTS
Jainism
Among the many unorthodox teachers who were contemporary with theBuddha was Vardhamana, known to his followers as Mahāvīra (“the GreatHero”). Jainism, the “Religion of the Conquerors” ( jinas), which hefounded, had a very different history from that of Buddhism. It succeeded inestablishing itself firmly, and in some places became very influential, but it never spread beyond India. Unlike Buddhism, there were no fundamental changes and developments in Jaina doctrine. But though the history of Jainism is less interesting than that of Buddhism, and though it was neverso important, it survived in the land of its birth, where it still has some twomillion adherents, mostly well-to-do merchants.

The legends of Vardhamāna Mahāvīra are less attractive than those of the Buddha and are even more formalized and unreliable, but as he is referred to in the Buddhist scriptures as one of the Buddha’s chief opponents, hishistoricity is beyond doubt. He was born about 540 B.C. and was the son ofSiddhārtha, a chief of the clan of Jñātrikas, [Page 288] the associates of theLicchavis of Vaiśālī; his mother, Triśalā, was the sister of the Licchavi chief Cetaka, _and thus, like the Buddha, he was wholly the product of theoligarchic martial clans which were a powerful political force at the time._

Though he was educated as a prince, and married and had a daughter, his real interest lay in the quest for salvation. At the age of thirty, when hisparents were dead, he left his home for a life of asceticism. At first he followed the practices of an ascetic group called the Nirgranthas (“Free from Bonds”), which had been founded some 200 years earlier by a certain Pārśva. The term Nirgrantha was later used for the members of the orderwhich Mahāvīra founded, and Pārśva was remembered as the twentythird ofthe twenty-four great teachers or Tīrthaṅ karas (“Fordmakers”) of the Jainafaith.

For over twelve years Vardhamana wandered from place to place, begging his bread, meditating, disputing, and subjecting his body to austerities of all kinds. At first he wore a single garment, which he never changed, but after thirteen months he laid this encumbrance aside, and the rest of his life was spent in complete nudity. For some six years his hardships were shared by another ascetic, Gosala Maskariputra, but ultimately the two quarrelled, and Gosala left Vardhamana to found the sect of Ajivikas.

In the thirteenth year of his asceticism Vardhamana found full enlightenment and Nirvāṇa; he became a “Worthy” ( Arhant), a “Conqueror” ( Jina), a “Ford-maker”’. He soon gained a great reputation and a large band of followers, and for thirty years he taught in the Gangetic kingdoms, patronized by the very kings who also patronized the Buddha.

He survived the death of his chief rival, Gosala, and probably also that of the Buddha, and died of self-starvation at the age of seventy-two, in the little town of Pava, near the Magadhan capital Rajagrha. There are conflicting traditions about the date of his death, which was probably in 468 B.C.

For some two centuries the Jainas remained a small community of monks and lay followers, less important than the rival sect of the Ajivikas.

According to a strongly held Jaina tradition Candragupta Maurya joined theorder as a monk on his abdication, and it seems certain that there was anaccession of strength in Maurya times. A serious famine at the end ofCandragupta’s reign led to a great exodus of Jaina monks from the Gangesto the Deccan, where they established important centres of their faith.

Out of this migration arose the great schism of Jainism, on a point of monastic discipline. Bhadrabahu, the elder of the community, who had led the emigrants, had insisted on the retention of the rule of nudity, which Mahāvīra had established. Sthūlabhadra, the leader of [Page 289] the monks who had remained in the North, allowed his followers to wear white garments, owing to the hardships and confusions of the famine. Hence arose the two sects of the Jainas, the Digambaras (“Space-clad”, i.e. naked), and the Śvetāmbaras (“White-clad”). The schism did not become final until the 1st century A.D., and there were never any fundamental doctrinal differences; later most monks of the naked sect took to wearing robes in public, but the division has persisted down to the present day.

According to tradition an oral sacred literature had been passed down from the days of Mahavlra, but Bhadrabahu was the last person to know it perfectly. On his death Sthūlabhadra called a great council at Pataliputra, and the canon was reconstructed as best possible in twelve Aṅ gas, or sections, which replaced the fourteen “former texts “( Pūrvas). This canonwas accepted only by the Śvetāmbaras; the Digambaras claimed that the oldcanon was hopelessly lost, and proceeded to devise new scriptures forthemselves, many of which are still unpublished. The texts of theSvetambara canon were finally settled and reduced to writing at a council atValabhi in Kāthiāwār in the 5th century A.D. By this time the texts hadbecome very corrupt, and one of the Aṅgas had been completely lost, whilenew material had been added to the original canon in the form of the twelveUpāṅ gas, or minor sections, and various lesser works. In the Middle Ages agreat body of commentarial literature was written both in Prakrit andSanskrit, and there were many able philosopher monks, who interpreted thescriptures of the sect. Some monks turned their attention to secular literature and other branches of learning, apparently without losing theirpiety. One of the last great poets in Sanskrit, Nayacandra, of the 14thcentury (p. 431f), was a Jaina monk, as was Mallinātha, the author of the standard commentary on the poems of Kālidāsa. We owe much to the Jainamonks’ love of literature. To copy a manuscript, even a secular one, was considered a work of great religious merit, and thus the old Jainamonasteries of Western India have preserved many rare and otherwiseunknown texts, some of which have still to be published, and many ofwhich are of non-Jaina origin.

In the period between the Mauryas and the Guptas Jainism can be traced from Orissā in the East to Mathurā in the West, but in later times it was chiefly concentrated in two regions—Kāthiāwār, Gujarat and parts ofRajasthan, where the Svetambara sect prevailed, and the central part of the Peninsula, the modern Mysore and South Hyderabad, where theDigambaras were dominant. The Ganges Valley, the original home ofJainism, was little affected by it. #quote a prophet is never recognized in his time and land

The Svetambaras found much support among the chiefs of Western [Page 290] India, and gained a position of great prominence during the reign of the Caulukya king Kumārapāla, who ruled Gujarāt and Kāthiāwār in the12th century. Under the guidance of a great Jaina scholar, Hemacandra,Kumārapāla is said to have instituted a Jaina reformation; but on his deaththe sect lost much of its influence, and though it still flourished it neveragain became so important. Similarly in the South the Digambaras had great influence in the early Middle Ages, thanks to the patronage of manyimportant kings, but this influence gradually diminished as devotionalŚaivism and Vaisnavism grew. There are traditions, which some havedoubted, but which we believe to have a basis of fact, that the Jainas weresometimes severely persecuted. But although Jainism declined it neverdisappeared.

Though the Jaina scriptures are comparatively late in their final form, there is so little divergence in fundamentals between the two great Jaina sects that it seems that the basic teachings of both are very ancient indeed,and are essentially those of Mahavira himself. Jainism, like Buddhism, isfundamentally atheistic, in that, while not denying the existence of the gods,it refuses them any important part in the universal scheme. The world, forthe Jaina, is not created, maintained or destroyed by a personal deity, butfunctions only according to universal law.

The universe is eternal. Its existence is divided into an infinite number ofcycles, each consisting of a period of improvement ( utsarpiṇ ī), and one ofdecline (avasarpiṇī). Each period is to all intents and purposes like the last,containing twenty-four Tirthankaras, twelve Universal Emperors( Cakravartins), altogether sixty-three Great Men( Śālāka-puruṣ as), who liveat regular intervals in the cycle. At the peak period men are of enormoussize and live to a tremendous age. They have no need of laws or property,for wishing-trees ( kalpa-vṛ kṣ a) give them all they need for the asking. Atpresent the world is rapidly declining. The last Tīrthaṅkara of this age haspassed to final Nirvāna, and gradually true religion will be lost—Mahāvīra,in his omniscience, even gave his followers the name and address of the lastJaina of this æon. The process of decline will continue for 40,000 years,when men will be dwarfs in stature, with a life of only twenty years, andwill dwell in caves, having forgotten all culture, even to the use of fire.

Then the tide will turn, and they will begin to improve again, only to decline once more, and so on for all eternity. Unlike the cosmology of the Buddhists and Hindus, that of the Jainas involves no cataclysms of universal destruction.

The universe functions through the interaction of living souls ( jivas, literally “lives”), and five categories of non-living entities ( ajiva): “ether” ( ākāśa), the means or condition of movement [Page 291] ( dharma), the means or condition of rest ( adharma), 18 time ( kāla), and matter ( pudgala).

Souls are not only the property of animal and plant life, but also of entities such as stones, rocks, running water, and many other natural objects not looked on as living by other sects.

The soul is naturally bright, all-knowing and blissful. There are an infinite number of souls in the universe, all fundamentally equal, but differing owing to the adherence of matter in a fine atomic form. This subtle matter, quite invisible to the human eye, is karma, the immaterial entity ofother systems interpreted materialistically. The naturally bright soulbecomes dulled and clouded over by karmic matter and thus acquires first aspiritual and then a material body. The obfuscation of the soul is comparedto the gradual clouding of a bright oily surface by motes of dust. Karma adheres to the soul as a result of activity. Any and every activity induceskarma of some kind, but deeds of a cruel and selfish nature induce more andmore dangerous karma than others. The karma already acquired leads to theacquisition of further karma, and thus the cycle of transmigration continuesindefinitely.

On these premisses transmigration can only be escaped by dispelling the karma already adhering to the soul and ensuring that no more is acquired.

This is a slow and difficult process and it is believed that many souls willnever succeed in accomplishing it, but will continue to transmigrate for alleternity. The annihilation ( nirjarā) of karma comes about through penance,and the prevention ( saṃ vara) of the influx ( āśrava) and fixation (bandha)19of karma in the soul is ensured by carefully disciplined conduct, as a resultof which it does not enter in dangerous quantities and is dispersedimmediately. When the soul has finally set itself free it rises at once to thetop of the universe, above the highest heaven, where it remains in inactiveomniscient bliss through all eternity. This, for the Jainas, is Nirvāṇa.

Though Jaina philosophers developed their doctrines, and evolved atheory of epistemology of great subtlety (p. 502f), these fundamentalteachings remained essentially unaltered. Mahavira and the twenty-threeother Tīrthaṅkaras were adored in the same way as the Buddha and as theHindu gods, but Jainism never compromised in its atheism, and there wasno development in this sect comparable to the Great Vehicle in Buddhism.

Jainism has survived for over 2,000 years on the basis of these austere teachings alone.

[Page 292] Full salvation is not possible to the layman. In this Jainism differs from Buddhism and Hinduism, which concede it in very exceptional cases. To attain Nirvana a man must abandon all trammels, including his clothes. Only by a long course of fasting, self-mortification, study andmeditation, can he rid himself of karma, and only by the most rigorousdiscipline can he prevent fresh karma from entering his soul. Hence amonastic life is essential for salvation. Very early, however, many Jainamonks gave up the rule of nudity, and today few if any monks, even of theDigambara sect, practise it regularly. Both sects of Jainas, however, wouldadmit that it is necessary to full salvation. The universe is now rapidlydeclining, and no souls now reach Nirvana or have any hope of reaching itin the foreseeable future, so in these degenerate days clothes are worn as aconcession to human frailty.

The regimen of the Jaina monk was, and still is, strict in the extreme. At
his initiation his hair was not shaved, but pulled out by the roots. He
subjected himself to many hardships, such as meditating in the full sunlight
of the Indian summer, or maintaining an uneasy posture for long periods on
end, though Jainism did not permit the more spectacular penances of some
Hindu ascetics. The monk’s frugal meals were interrupted by numerous
fasts, and many monks starved themselves to death, following the example
of Mahavira himself.

The life of the monk was governed by five vows, abjuring killing, stealing, lying, sexual activity and the possession of property. These vows were interpreted quite strictly. Acts of violence and killing, whether intentional or not, were the most potent cause of the influx of karma, and were therefore particularly to be avoided. Meat-eating was quite forbidden to monk and layman alike. Even insect life was carefully protected. Like theBuddhist monks, the Jainas strained their drinking-water to save the lives ofanimalculæ. Jaina monks usually carried feather dusters, to brush ants andother insects from their path and save them from being trampled underfoot,and they wore veils over their mouths, to prevent the minute living things inthe air from being inhaled and killed. No lay Jaina could take up theprofession of agriculture, since this involved not only the destruction ofplant life, but also of many living things in the soil. Thus, in its insistenceon ahimsa, or non-violence, Jainism went much further than any otherIndian religion.

It has been suggested that Jainism survived in India, whereas Buddhismperished, because the former sect took better care of its layfolk. The Jainamonks perhaps paid greater attention to the laymen than did the Buddhists,and in Jainism the layman was a definite member of the Order, encouragedto undertake periodical retreats, [Page 293] and to live as far as possible thelife of the monk for specified periods. Like Buddhism, Jainism encouragedthe commercial virtues of honesty and frugality, and at a very early periodthe Jaina lay community became predominantly mercantile. The splendidJaina temples at such places as Mount Abu and Sravana Belgola aretestimonies of the great wealth and piety of medieval Jaina laymen.

Jainism had no special social doctrines. The domestic rites of the layman,such as birth, marriage and death, were those of the Hindus. At one timeJainism maintained a cult of stśpas, in the same way as Buddhism, but thishas not survived, and early in the Christian era the Tīrthaṅkaras wereadored in temples in the form of icons. By the Middle Ages this worshipapproximated to that of the Hindus, with offerings of flowers, incense,lamps and so on. As with Buddhism, the chief gods of the Hindus foundtheir way into Jaina temples in subordinate positions, and though there wasno real compromise with theism the sect easily fitted into the Hindu order,its members forming distinct castes.

Jaina religious literature is generally dull, and often pedantic, and itsethics, though they inculcate such virtues as honesty and mercy, tend to benegative and fundamentally selfish. The virtue of nonviolence in Jainismoften had little of love about it, but merely involved vegetarianism, andprecautions against the accidental killing of small animals. There are,however, passages in the Jaina scriptures which show warmth and humansympathy. Thus, discussing the doctrine of non-violence, the earlyĀcārāṅ ga Sūtra writes:
“A wise man should be neither glad nor angry, for he should know and consider the happiness of all things…. Life is dear to the many who ownfields and houses, who get dyed and coloured clothes and jewels andearrings, and grow attached to them…. Only those who are of controlledconduct do not desire these things; therefore, knowing birth and death, youshould firmly walk the path.

“For nothing is inaccessible to death, and all beings are fond ofthemselves, they love pleasure and hate pain, they shun destruction andcling to life. They long to live. To all things life is dear.”48More typical of Jaina moral teachings are the following verses, said tohave been spoken by Mahāvīra to Gautama, one of his disciples (not, ofcourse, to be confused with Gautama the Buddha).

“As the dead leaf when its time is up falls from the tree to the ground, so is the life of man.

Gautama, always be watchful!

[Page 294] “As the dewdrop that sways on a blade of grass lasts but a moment, so is the life of man.

Gautama, always be watchful!

“For the soul which suffers for its carelessness
is whirled about in the universe,
through good and evil karma.

Gautama, always be watchful!

“When the body grows old and the hair turns white,
and all the vital powers decrease…
despondency and disease befall, and the flesh wastes and decays.

Gautama, always be watchful!

“So cast away all attachments,
and be pure as a lotus, or as water in autumn.

Free from every attachment,
Gautama, always be watchful!” 49
As an example of Digambara teaching we give a few verses, remarkable
for their conciseness, by the 4th century monk Pūjyapāda.

“Body, house, wealth and wife,
sons and friends and enemies—
all are different from the soul.

Only the fool thinks them his own.”

“From all directions come the birds
and rest together in the trees;
but in the morning each goes his own way,
flying in all directions.”

“Death is not for me. Why then should I fear?

Disease is not for me. Why then should I despair?

I am not a child, nor a youth, nor an old man—
All these states are only of my body.”

“Time and again in my foolishness I have enjoyed
all kinds of body and have discarded them.

Now I am wise!

Why should I long for rubbish?”

“The soul is one thing, matter another—
that is the quintessence of truth.

Whatever else may be said
is merely its elaboration.”50

### The Ājivikas
A third unorthodox sect which emerged at the same time as Buddhism and Jainism was that of the Ājivikas, a body of ascetics who [Page 295]were under a rigorous discipline similar to that of the Jainas, whichinvolved complete nudity. The doctrines of the founder of the sect, GosalaMaskariputra, bear a generic likeness to those of his contemporary andformer friend Mahavira. Like Mahavira, he looked back to earlier teachersand ascetic groups, whose doctrines he refurbished and developed.

According to both Buddhist and Jaina tradition he was of humble birth; hedied a year or so before the Buddha, about 484 B.C., after a fierce altercationwith Mahavira in the city of Śrśvastī. His followers seem to have combined with those of other teachers, such as Pūraṇa Kāśyapa the antinomian andPakudha Kātyāyana the atomist, to form the Ājivika sect. After a period ofprosperity in Mauryan times, when Aśoka and his successor Daśaratha presented caves to the Ājivikas, the sect rapidly declined, and only retainedsome local importance in a small region of Eastern Mysore and the adjacentparts of Madras, where it survived until the 14th century, after which wehear no more of it.

No scriptures of the Ājivikas have come down to us, and the little weknow about them has to be reconstructed from the polemic literature ofBuddhism and Jainism. The sect was certainly atheistic, and its main featurewas strict determinism. The usual doctrine of karma taught that though aman’s present condition was determined by his past actions he couldinfluence his destiny, in this life and the future, by choosing the right courseof conduct. This the Ajivikas denied. The whole universe was conditionedand determined to the smallest detail by an impersonal cosmic principle,Niyati, or destiny. It was impossible to influence the course oftransmigration in any way.

“All that have breath, all that are born, all that have life, are without power, strength or virtue, but are developed by destiny, chance and nature,and experience joy and sorrow in the six classes [of existence]. There are…8,400,000 great æons ( mahākappa), through which fool and wise alike musttake their course and make an end of sorrow. There is no [question of]bringing unripe karma to fruition, nor of exhausting karma already ripened,by virtuous conduct, by vows, by penance, or by chastity. That cannot bedone. Samsara is measured as with a bushel, with its joy and sorrow and itsappointed end. It can neither be lessened nor increased, nor is there anyexcess or deficiency of it. Just as a ball of string will, when thrown, unwindto its full length, so fool and wise alike will take their course, and make anend of sorrow.”51
[[2021-12-03]]
Though nothing that a man could do would in any way influence his future lot Ajivika monks practised severe asceticism, because the force of destiny compelled them to do so, although their religious opponents accused them of licentiousness and immorality.

The Dravidian Ājivikas developed their doctrines in a way [Page 296] resembling Buddhism of the Great Vehicle. Gosala became an ineffable divinity, like the Buddha in the Mahayana system, while the doctrine of destiny evolved into a Parmenidean view that all change and movement were illusory, and that the world was in reality eternally and immovably at rest. This view bears a certain resemblance to Nāgārjuna’s doctrine of “the Void”.

### Scepticism and Materialism.

Buddha, Mahavira, Gosala, and many lesser teachers of their period ignored the gods, but they were not thoroughgoing atheists and materialists.

All admitted the existence of supernatural beings of strictly limited powers,and all accepted the fundamental doctrine of transmigration, though they interpreted its mechanics individually. Some thinkers, however, rejected all immaterial categories completely, and their influence may have been widerthan appears from the religious texts of the period. In the fairly early KathaUpanisad the interlocutor Naciketas (p. 157) questions Yama, the god ofdeath, in these terms: “There is doubt about the state of a man who is dead -some say he is, others, he is not.” “On this point”, Yama replies, “even thegods formerly had their doubts. It is not easy to understand.” At this timeunbelief must have been fairly widespread.

Ajita Kesakambalin (Ajita of the Hair-blanket, no doubt so called from the garb of his order), a contemporary of the Buddha, was the earliest known teacher of complete materialism.

“Man,” he said, “is formed of the four elements. When he dies earthreturns to the aggregate of earth, water to water, fire to fire, and air toair, while his senses vanish into space. Four men with the bier take upthe corpse; they gossip [about the dead man] as far as the burning-ground, where his bones turn the colour of a dove’s wing and hissacrifices end in ashes. They are fools who preach almsgiving, andthose who maintain the existence [of immaterial categories] speak vain

and lying nonsense. When the body dies both fool and wise alike are cut off and perish. They do not survive after death.” 52If we are to believe the Buddhist scriptures, Ajita founded a sect ofmonks. The Buddha condemned them as having no good motive for theirasceticism, the degree of which is nowhere made clear. It is possible that,like the Epicureans, they were not so much an ascetic order as a fraternityof men with common aims, cultivating together the simpler pleasures oflife. In any case, an undercurrent of materialism is traceable in Indianthought from this time onwards. Religious and philosophical literature,whether Hindu, Buddhist or Jaina, devotes much space to attacking the eviltenets of the Cārvākas [Page 297] or Lokāyatas, as the materialist schoolswere called. Throughout the period which we treat these unbelievers arereferred to with scorn and disapprobation, which sometimes seems tocontain an undertone of fear, as though the pious authors thought it reallypossible that the materialists might shake the foundations of the establishedorder. Materialist and irreligious undercurrents are traceable in some secularliterature, such as the Arthaśāstra and the Kāmasūtra.

PLATE LXII
The general attitude of the materialist schools, according to their adversaries, was that all religious observance and morality were futile. A man should make the most of life and get what happiness he could out of it.

The frugal virtues of Buddhism and Jainism were rejected.

“As long as he lives a man should live happily and drink ghee, though he run into debt, for when the body is turned to ashes how can there be any return to life?”53 A man must not turn back from pleasure for fear of concomitant sorrow. He must accept occasional sorrow gladly, for the sake of the joy which he finds in the world, as he accepts the bones with the fish or the husk with the corn.

“Whoever turns in fear from the joy that he sees before him is a fool, no better than an animal.” 54 Their opponents ascribe only base ideals to the materialists, and there is no definite evidence that they had any ethical doctrines, but one verse attributed to them shows that they were not blind to the warm ties of family and friendship.

“If a man really left his body,and passed on to the other world,would he not come back once more,drawn by his love for his kin?”55Besides numerous quotations attributed to materialists in religious andphilosophical works one materialist philosophical text has survived. This isthe Tattvopaplavasiṃ ha (freely “The Lion Destroying all Religious Truth”)written by a certain Jayarasi in the 8th century A.D. The author was an out-and-out Pyrrhonist denying the possibility of any certain knowledge at all,and he demolished with able dialectic, to his own satisfaction at any rate, allthe basic presuppositions of the chief religious systems of his day.



## (IV) HINDUISM
Development and Literature
As well as the aristocratic religion of the brāhmaṇs, the Buddhist and Jaina scriptures mention popular cults, connected with earth [Page 298] spirits ( yakṣ as), snake-spirits ( nāgas), and other minor deities, centred round sacred spots or caityas (p. 262). Very early a god named Vasudeva was widely worshipped, especially in Western India. It was to this god thatthe Besnagar column, to which we have more than once referred, waserected. The inscription on the column shows that by the end of the 2ndcentury B.C. the cult of Vasudeva was receiving the support of the rulingclasses, and even of the Western invaders. Soon after this Vasudeva wasidentified with the Vedic god Viṣṇu, if indeed the identification had notalready been made, and further syncretisms were taking place. Nārāyaṇa, agod of obscure origin mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa literature, was alsoidentified with Viṣṇu, whose name was by now closely connected with thatof Krsna, one of the heroes of the martial traditions which were beingbrought together at this time to form the great epic, the Mahābhārata.

The character of Viṣṇu, and of the gods associated with him, developedthrough the centuries, as further popular divinities were in one way oranother identified with him. Among some of the lower orders theriomorphiccults prevailed, especially in Eastern Mālwā, where a divinity in the form ofa boar was worshipped. By Gupta times the cult of the divine boar wasassimilated to that of Visnu. A pastoral flute-playing deity, popular amongherdsmen and of uncertain origin, was identified with the hero Krsna, bynow recognized as an incarnation of Viṣṇu. The brahmanic heroParaśurāma was similarly accounted for, while in medieval times the heroof the second great Indian epic, Rama, was also brought into the Vaisnavite pantheon.

Simultaneously a fertility deity, whose cult may have been kept alive innon-brahmanic circles from the days of the Harappā culture, rose inprominence. This was Siva, identified with the Vedic Rudra and usuallyworshipped in the form of the phallic emblem ( linga). With Śiva were laterassociated certain other popular divinities, such as Skanda and the elephant-headed Gaṇeśa. At the end of the Gupta period goddesses rose toprominence, together with magical cults, religious sexuality, and animalsacrifice in a new form, which increased in importance throughout the earlyMiddle Ages.

The final form of Hinduism was largely the result of influence from the Dravidian South. Here, on the basis of indigenous cults fertilized by Āryaninfluences, theistic schools had arisen, characterized by intense ecstaticpiety. It was this devotional Hinduism, propagated by many wanderingpreachers and hymn-singers in the medieval period, which had the greatesteffect on Hinduism as it exists today.

During this period an enormous body of sacred literature was produced.

The Vedas, Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, theoretically still the [Page 299]most sacred of all India’s religious literature, were studied only by thosewho had undergone the ceremony of initiation, and became more and morethe preserve of the brāhmaṇs, who themselves often interpreted themfiguratively in the light of the new doctrines. The real scriptures ofHinduism, as distinct from brahmanism, were available to all, even to menof low caste and to women. These were the Epics, the Purāṇ as, the booksof Sacred Law, which we have treated elsewhere (p. 112f), and numeroushymns and religious poems. For the learned there was a voluminousliterature of commentaries, and many treatises on various aspects oftheology and philosophy.

The two great Epics were originally secular, and in their literary aspect
will be treated later (p. 407f). Very early, probably before the Christian era, the Mahābhārata began to receive religious interpolations, and was soon looked on as a sacred text. The most sacred of these interpolations is thefamous Bhagavad Gītā, itself a compilation of material from varioussources, to which we shall often refer in the course of this chapter; butmuch literature on the Sacred Law, as well as religious legends of manykinds, has found its way into the Epic which, as it exists at present, formsan encyclopedia of early Hinduism. An important appendix to theMahābhārata is the Harivaṃ sa, giving the legend of the god Krsna in adeveloped form. The second epic, the Rāmāyaṇ a, was also secular in itsearliest form, but at a comparatively late period, probably after the age ofthe Guptas, an introductory and a final canto were added, together withother interpolations, which raised the text to the status of a sacred scripture.

The Puranas (“Ancient Stories”) are compendia of legends and religious instructions. There are eighteen chief Puranas of which perhaps the most important are the Vāyu, Viṣṇ u, Agni, Bhaviṣ ya and Bhāgavata Purāṇ as. In their present form they are not very ancient, none going back earlier than the Gupta period and all containing interpolations, but much of their legendary material is very old indeed.

Much later religious poetry is of small literary value, and has little more sanctity than have “Hymns Ancient and Modern” in the Church of England.

Certain poems, however, are looked on by modern sects as very sacred,especially the Gītā Govinda, a collection of interlinked religious songs bythe 12th-century Bengali poet Jayadeva (p. 428f). Some medieval stotras orhymns of praise, notably those attributed to the theologian Śaṅkara, haveconsiderable literary merit, and are looked on with great respect. ThePeninsula produced much vernacular sacred poetry during our period, someof which is of great value, and is considered to be very holy. [Page 300] Abeautiful collection of moral aphorisms in Tamil verse, the Tirukkural(“Sacred Couplets”), attributed to Tiruvalluvar, perhaps dates from the 4thor 5th centuries A.D., though some authorities would put it much earlier.

Later, from the 7th to the 10th centuries, were composed the eleven sacred books ( Tirumurai) of the Tamil Saivites, anthologies of hymns by the sixty- three Nāyanārs, or Teachers. Chief of these eleven works are the Tevāram, containing songs by the three poets Appar, Ñānasambandar, and Sundaramūrti, and the Tiruvāśagam of Māṇikka Vāśagar. The TamilVaiṣṇavites at about the same period produced the Ndldyiram (“FourThousand”), a collection of stanzas attributed to the twelve Alvars or saintsof the sect. Similar collections of devotional poetry, still looked on locallyas very sacred, were composed at the end of our period in Canarese andTelugu. At a later time much devotional literature was written in the Āryanvernaculars, but none survives from the period before the Musliminvasions, except perhaps the works of some of the Maratha Vaisnavitehymn singers, Jfinnesvar, Namdev and a few others, who, according totradition, lived at the end of the 13th century.

We cannot here catalogue the great mass of religio-philosophical literature of Hinduism, some of which will be mentioned in the followingpages.

Visnu
To the Vaisnavite, or the devotee of Visnu, this god is the source of the universe and of all things. According to the most famous cosmic myth of Hinduism he sleeps in the primeval ocean, on the thousand-headed snake Sesa. In his sleep a lotus grows from his navel, and in the lotus is born thedemiurge Brahma,20 who creates the world. Once the world is created Visnuawakes, to reign in the highest heaven, Vaikuntha. He is usually depicted asa four-armed man of dark blue colour, crowned and seated on his throne,bearing in his hands his emblems, the conch, discus, mace and lotus,wearing the holy jewel called Kaustubha round his neck, and with a tuft ofcurly hair ( Srivatsa) on his chest. He rides the great eagle Garuda, generallyshown with a half-human face, who is perhaps the survival of an ancienttheriomorphic cult, and who was already associated with Vasudeva, one ofVisnu’s early forms, when Heliodorus erected his column at Besnagar.

Visnu’s spouse, Laksmi, is an important goddess in her own right.

Visnu’s status as the Universal God, of whom all other gods are aspects or emanations, appears as early as the Bhagavad Gītā.

[Page 301] “Now I will tell the chief of my holy powers….

though there is no end to my fullness.

I am the self in the inmost heart of all that are born….

I am their beginning, their middle and their end….

I am the beginning, the middle, the end, of all creation,
the science of the soul among sciences,
of speakers I am the speech,
of letters I am A. 21
“I am unending time,
I am the ordainer who faces all ways,
I am destroying death,
I am the source of all that is to be….

I am the dice-play of the gamester,
I am the glory of the glorious,
I am victory, I am courage,
I am the goodness of the virtuous….

I am the force of those who govern,
I am the statecraft of those who seek to conquer,
I am the silence of what is secret,
I am the knowledge of those who know,
and I am the seed of all that is born….

“There is nothing that can exist without me.

There is no end to my holy powers…
And whatever is mighty or fortunate or strong
springs from a portion of my glory.”56
Though his counterpart Śiva has a rather ferocious and dangerous side to
his character, Visnu is generally thought of as wholly benevolent. The god
works continuously for the welfare of the world, and with this in view has
from time to time incarnated himself, wholly or partially. The earliest
version of this doctrine is contained in the Bhagavad Gītā, wherein Krsna
reveals himself as the ever-active godhead incarnate.

“In essence I am never born, I never alter.

I am the lord of all beings
and the full master of my own nature,
yet of my own power I come to be.

“Whenever the Sacred Law fails, and evil raises its head,
I take embodied birth.

To guard the righteous and root out the sinners,
and to establish the Sacred Law,
I am born from age to age.” 57
[Page 302] The Avataras (“descents”) or incarnations of Visnu are,
according to the most popular classification, ten. The divinities and heroes
composing the list were adopted by Vaisnavism at different times, but all
were incorporated by the 1 th century. It may be that the Vaisnavite doctrine
of incarnation owes something to the Buddhist and Jaina doctrines of
former Buddhas and Tirthaikaras, which are certainly attested earlier. An
incarnation might be total or partialfor “whatever is mighty or fortunate or
strong springs from a portion of my glory.” In this sense every good or great
man was thought of as a partial incarnation of Visnu. The ten chief
incarnations, however, are of a more special type, for in them the god is
believed to have taken flesh to save the world from imminent danger of
total destruction. They are as follows:
(1) The Fish ( Matsya). When the earth was overwhelmed by a universal
flood Visnu took the form of a fish, who first warned Manu (the Hindu
Adam) of the impending danger, and then carried him, his family, and the
seven great sages ( rsis) in a ship, fastened to a horn on his head. He also
saved the Vedas from the flood. The fish legend first appears in the
brāhmanas, and the Noah’s Ark theme suggests Semitic influence. The Fish
incarnation was never widely worshipped.

(2) The Tortoise ( Kurma). Many divine treasures were lost in the flood,
including the ambrosia ( amrta), 22 with which the gods preserved their
youth. Visnu became a great tortoise, and dived to the bottom of the cosmic
ocean. On his back the gods placed Mount Mandara, and, twining the divine
snake Vasuki around the mountain, churned the ocean in the manner in
which an Indian dairyman churns butter, twirling the mountain by pulling
the snake. From the churned ocean emerged the ambrosia, and various other
treasures, including the goddess Laksmī. The story is probably a piece of
very early folklore, but the identification of the tortoise with Visnu is
comparatively late, and, though frequently mentioned in literature, this
incarnation had little real importance.

(3) The Boar ( Varāha). A demon, Hiraniyāksa, cast the earth once more
into the depths of the cosmic ocean. Visnu took the form of an enormous
boar, killed the demon, and raised the earth on his tusk (pl. XXXVII c). The
legend looks back to the brāhmanas, but probably developed through a
primitive non-Āryan cult of a sacred pig. The cult of the Boar incarnation
was important in some parts of India in Gupta times.

(4) The Man-Lion ( Narasimha). Another demon, Hiranya [Page 303]
kasipu, had obtained a boon from Brahma ensuring that he could not be
killed either by day or night by god, man or beast. Thus safeguarded he
persecuted both gods and men, including his pious son Prahlada. When
Prahlada called on Visnu for help the god burst from a pillar of the demon’s
palace at sunset, when it was neither night nor day, in a form half man and
half lion, and slew Hiranyakasipu. Narasimha was worshipped as their
special divinity ( istadevatā) by a small sect, and was often depicted in
sculpture.

(5) The Dwarf ( Vāmana). A demon named Bali gained control of the
world, and commenced a course of asceticism, by which his supernatural
power so increased that he menaced even the gods. Visnu appeared before
him in the form of a dwarf, and asked as a boon as much land as he could
cover in three strides. When the boon was granted the god became a giant,
and in three strides covered earth, heaven and the middle air, leaving only
the infernal regions to the demon. The three steps of Visnu are as old as the
Ṛ g Veda, but other popular elements were incorporated into the story.

(6) Parasurāma (Rāma with the Axe). Visnu took human form as the son
of a brahman Jamadagni. When his father was robbed by the wicked King
Kartavirya, Paraśurāma killed the latter. Jamadagni was in turn killed by the
sons of Kartavirya, after which the enraged Paraśurāma destroyed all the
males of the ksatriya class twenty-one times in succession. Though
Paraśurāma is frequently referred to in literature, he seems rarely to have
been specially worshipped.

(7) Rama, Prince of Ayodhya and hero of the Rāmāyana. Visnu
incarnated himself in this form to save the world from the oppressions of
the demon Rāvana. To the European his story is rather a matter of literature
than of religion and will be told in a later chapter (p. 412ff). Rāma may
have been a chief who lived in the 8th or 7th century B.C., and in the earliest
form of the story he has no divine attributes. Though he was believed to be
an earlier incarnation than Krsna, his cult developed later than Krsna’s, and
does not appear to have been very important until the end of our period.

Rāma is usually depicted as of dark hue, often bearing a bow and arrow. He
is attended by his faithful wife Sita, the personification of wifely devotion,
and often also by his three loyal brothers, Laksmana, Bharata and
Śatrughna, and by his friend and helper, the monkey-god Hanumant. To his
devotees Rama combines the ideals of the gentle, faithful husband, the
leader brave in hardship, and the just and benevolent king. It is perhaps
significant that his cult only became really popular after the Muslim
invasion.

(8) Krsna was undoubtedly the most important of the incarnations of
Visnu. His legend in its final form is very long and can only be outlined
briefly here.

[Page 304] Krsna was born at Mathurā, of the tribe of the Yadavas. His
father was Vasudeva, and his mother was Devaki, the aunt of the ruling
King Kamsa. It was prophesied that Kamsa would be killed by Devaki’s
eighth son, so he set out to destroy all her children. But Krsna and his elder
brother Balarāma were saved, and were brought up as the children of thecowherd Nanda and his wife Yasoda. Kamsa, hearing that the boys hadescaped his clutches, ordered the slaughter of all the male children in hiskingdom, but Nanda smuggled the boys away, first to Vraja and then toVrndavana, districts not far from Mathurā which are still very sacred toKrsna.In his childhood the incarnate god performed many miracles, killingdemons, and sheltering the cowherds from a storm by holding MountGovardhana over their heads with his finger; he also played numerouschildish pranks, such as stealing Yasoda’s butter. In his adolescence he hadmany amours with the wives and daughters of the cowherds ( gopis), andaccompanied their dances on his flute. His favourite was the beautifulRadha.But his youthful days soon ended. Kamsa traced him and made furtherattempts on his life. Krsna then gave up his idyllic pastoral life, and turnedon his wicked cousin. He slew Kamsa, and seized the kingdom of Mathurā,but, pressed between Kamsa’s father-in-law, Jarasandha king of Magadha,	and an unnamed Yavana king of the North-West, he was forced to leave hiskingdom, and with his followers founded a new capital at Dvaraka inKathiawar. Here he made Rukmini, daughter of the king of Vidarbha(modern Berar), his chief queen, and amassed a total of over 16,000 wivesand 180,000 sons. His adventures at this stage of his career include thedestruction of wicked kings and demons all over India. Throughout thestory of the Mahdbhdrata he appears as the constant friend and advisor ofthe five Pandavas, and he preached the great sermon of the Bhagavad Gitato Arjuna before the battle which is the centre of the epic story.After seeing the Pandavas safely installed in the Kuru land, Krsnareturned to Dvaraka. Here ominous portents beset the city, as the Yadavachiefs quarrelled among themselves. Krsna banned strong drink, in the hopeof staving off the evil day, but, on the occasion of a festival, he relaxed theban. The Yadava chiefs began to brawl, and the whole city was soon inuproar. Krsna, for all his divinity, could do nothing to quell the feud, whichinvolved the whole people. His son Pradyumna was killed before his eyes,and his faithful brother BalaRāma wounded to death; nearly all the chiefs ofthe Yadavas were slain. Krsna dejectedly wandered in a forest near the city;there, as he sat musing on the loss of his friends and family, a hunter spiedhim through the undergrowth and mistook him for a deer. An arrow piercedhis heel, which, like that of Achilles, was his one vulnerable spot, and hedied. The city of Dvaraka was then swallowed by the sea.Of the many elements which have gone to the making of this story that ofKrsna as hero was the earliest to have been given a place in orthodoxtradition. A Krsna son of Devaki is mentioned as early as the Upanisads58as studying the new doctrines of the soul, and it [Page 305] seems certainthat there is some historical basis for the legend of the hero-god; butevidently tales of many heroes from many ages and many parts of Indiahave been fused together in the Krsna myth, including some which seemrather inconsistent with the general character of the conquering hero, suchas that of his somewhat ignominious retreat from Mathurā. Other elementsin the story, such as the destruction of the Yadavas and the death of the god,are quite un-Indian in their tragic character. The themes of the drunkenbrawl leading to general slaughter, of the hero slain by an arrow piercing hisone vulnerable spot, and of the great city engulfed by the sea, are wellknown in European epic literature, but do not occur elsewhere in that ofIndia, and are not hinted at in the Vedas. The concept of the dying god, sowidespread in the ancient Near East, is found nowhere else in Indianmythology. Kamsa, the wicked cousin, seems to echo Herod, and perhapsalso Acrisius, the cruel grandfather of Perseus. Some parts of the story maybe derived from very ancient stories, handed down and developed by Āryanwarriors from the days before they entered India; others are of indigenousorigin; and yet others are possibly inspired by garbled versions of tales fromthe West.Krsna in his pastoral and erotic aspect is evidently of different originfrom Krsna the hero. The name means “black”, and the god is usuallydepicted as of that colour. Perhaps the oldest clear reference to the pastoralKrsna is in the early Tamil anthologies, where “the Black One” ( Mayin)plays his flute and sports with milkmaids. He may have been originally afertility god of the Peninsula, whose cult was carried to the North bynomadic tribes of herdsmen. A tribe which appeared in Malwa and theWestern Deccan early in the Christian era, the Abhiras, is thought to haveplayed a big part in the propagation of the worship of Krsna Govinda(“Lord of Herdsman”, 23 a very common epithet of the god in this aspect).The young Krsna’s erotic exploits have been the source of much romanticliterature which, superficially, contains but a faint religious element.Invariably, however, the love of the god for the cowherds’ wives isinterpreted as symbolic of the love of God for the human soul. The notes ofKrsna’s flute, calling the women to leave their husbands’ beds and dancewith him in the moonlight, represent the voice of God, calling man to leaveearthly things and turn to the joys of divine love. So Jew and Christian alikehave interpreted the Song of Songs, and so many mystical poets of allreligions have depicted their spiritual experience. Despite its luxurianteroticism the legend [Page 306] of the Divine Cowherd has produced greatreligious poetry (p. 428f), and inspired many pious souls.The third element of the Krsna legend is that of the child god. This isdefinitely the latest part to be assimilated, and its origin is quite unknown.Can it be partly inspired by tales brought by Christian merchants orNestorian missionaries to the west coast of India in the early Middle Ages?Most authorities would deny this, but we do not reject the possibility out ofhand. In any case, the story of the child Krsna, often depicted in latersculpture as a plump infant crawling on all fours, gave the god a rarecompleteness. As hero he met the worshipper’s need of a divine father andelder brother; as the young cowherd, he was a divine lover; and as infant, ason. The cult of the child Krsna made a special appeal to the warmmaternity of Indian womanhood; and even today the simpler women ofIndia, while worshipping the divine child, so delightfully naughty despitehis mighty power, refer to themselves as “the Mother of God”.Vasudeva, the popular god of Western India in the early centuries B.C.,was early identified with Krsna, and it may be that the name, falselyinterpreted as a patronymic, resulted in the tradition that Krsn. a’s fatherwas called Vasudeva (with short a in the first syllable). Other deities,originally independent, were associated with Krsna in one way and another.Chief of these was his elder brother Balarama, also called Halayudha (”Armed with a Plough”) and Sankarsana. Balarama, bearing a woodenplough on his shoulder, was originally an agricultural deity. Traditionally hewas a heavy drinker, and had some of the characteristics of a Silenus.Temples to him existed at one time, but his importance waned in the MiddleAges, as that of Krsna increased. Less important were the cults of Krsna’sson Pradyumna, of his grandson Aniruddha, and of his friend Arjuna, thePandava hero. The chief feminine associate of Krsna was Rādhā, thefavourite mistress of his youth, who was often worshipped with him in thelate Middle Ages. Rukminī, his chief queen, also received some reverence.(9) Buddha, the last historical incarnation of Visnu. According to mosttheologians the god became Buddha in order to delude the wicked, leadthem to deny the Vedas, and thus ensure their damnation. Jayadeva’s GītāGovinda, however, which contains one of the earliest lists of incarnations,states that Visnu became Buddha out of compassion for animals, 59 in orderto put an end to bloody sacrifice. This probably gives a clue to the truebackground of the Buddha avatāra. He was included in the list, as otherdeities were included, in order to assimilate heterodox elements into theVaisnavite fold: Until quite recently the temple of the Buddha at Gayā wasin the [Page 307] hands of Hindus, and the teacher was there worshipped byHindus as a Hindu god; but in general little attention was paid to theBuddha avatara.(10) Kalkin, the incarnation yet to come. At the end of this dark ageVisnu will appear in the form of a man mounted on a white horse, with aflaming sword in his hand. He will judge the wicked, reward the good, andrestore the age of gold. This is a late addition to Vaisnavite myth, and doesnot play a very important part in literature or iconography, though it is saidthat many simple Hindus have taken the Kalkin very seriously, and long forhis arrival just as oldfashioned Christians look forward to the secondcoming of Christ. Christian parallels have been found, especially with thehorseman of the Book of Revelation, 60 but the main inspiration of theKalkin may have come from Buddhism, which taught the coming ofMaitreya Buddha long before the Vaisnavites devised the Kalkin.Zoroastrian ideas may also have helped in the formation of the myth.ŚivaAlmost as popular as the numerous forms of Visnu was Śiva, whoevolved from the fierce Vedic god Rudra (p. 238), with whom mergedelements of a non-Āryan fertility deity. Though developed Śaivite sectsoften made of their chosen divinity a wholly moral and paternal father inheaven, giva’s character, unlike that of Visnu, is ambivalent. He lurks inhorrible places, such as battlefields, burning-grounds and crossroads,which, in India as in Europe, were looked on as very inauspicious. Hewears a garland of skulls and is surrounded by ghosts, evil spirits anddemons. He is death and time ( Mahakkla), which destroy all things.But he is also a great ascetic, and the patron deity of ascetics generally.On the high slopes of the Himalayan Mount Kailasa Śiva, the great yogi,sits on a tiger skin, deep in meditation, and through his meditation the worldis maintained. He is depicted thus as wearing his long matted hair ( jata) in atopknot, in which the crescent moon is fixed, and from which flows thesacred river Ganges. In the middle of his forehead is a third eye, emblem ofhis superior wisdom and insight. His neck is black, scarred by adeadlypoison which was the last of the objects churned from the cosmicocean, and which he drank to save the other gods from destruction. Snakes,of which he is the lord, encircle his neck and arms. His body is coveredwith ashes, a favourite ascetic practice. Beside him is his weapon, thetrident, while near him are his beautiful wife Pārvatī and his mount, the bullNandi.Though in this aspect giva is continually wrapped in meditation, he [Page308] can, in his divine power, divide his personality. Not only is he the godof mystical stillness, but also the Lord of the Dance ( Nataraja) (pl. LXVI).This aspect of giva is specially popular in the Tamil country, wherereligious dancing was part of the earliest known Tamil tradition. In hisheavenly palace on Mount Kailasa, or in his southern home, the temple ofCidambaram or Tillai (near the seacoast about fifty miles south ofPondicherry), mystically identified with Kailasa, Śiva dances. He hasinvented no less than 108 different dances, some calm and gentle, othersfierce, orgiastic and terrible. Of the latter the most famous is the tandava, inwhich the angry god, surrounded by his drunken attendants ( ganas), beatsout a wild rhythm which destroys the world at the end of the cosmic cycle.A further form in which the god is worshipped is known as the “South-facing” ( Daksinamurti) (pl. LXVIII); in this aspect he is the universalteacher, depicted in an informal pose, with one foot on the ground and theother on the throne on which he sits, and with one hand raised in a gestureof explanation. This form of Śiva perhaps owes something to Buddhistinspiration.But Śiva was and still is chiefly worshipped in the form of the liiga (pl.XXVIb), usually a short cylindrical pillar with rounded top, which is thesurvival of a cult older than Indian civilization itself. Phalli have been foundin the Harappā remains. Early Tamil literature refers to the setting up ofritual posts, which seem to have been phallic emblems. The cult of thelifiga, at all times followed by some of the non-Āryan peoples, wasincorporated into Hinduism around the beginning of the Christian era,though at first it was not very important. As early as the Ṛ g Veda, Rudra,the mountain god, was connected with plants and animals. The hornedithyphallic god of Mohenjo Daro, surrounded by animals, may well be theprototype of Siva, as the patron of reproduction in men, animals and plants.In this form he is known as Paśupati (“Lord of Beasts”) and is oftenrepresented in South India as a four armed man, with one hand in anattitude of blessing, the second open, as though bestowing a boon, an axe inthe third, and a small deer springing from the fingers of the fourth (pl.LXVIIb).Some Saivite sects declare that Śiva has performed a series of avataras,but these are pure imitations of those of Visnu and have never played a bigpart in Saivite thought. The god has, however, manifested himself fromtime to time in theophanies, or taken temporary incarnation to destroydemons or test the virtue of warriors or sages. Numerous legends are told ofhim, some of them quite uncomplimentary. The most famous of theselegends is that of his [Page 309] marriage to Pārvatī, the daughter ofHimalaya, the personified mountains.The gods were troubled by the demon Taraka, and it was prophesied that hecould only be destroyed by the child of Śiva and the Daughter of theMountains. But Śiva was continually wrapped in meditation, and theprospect of his producing offspring seemed to the other gods to be faintindeed. However Pārvatī, the beautiful daughter of Himalaya, was sent attheir behest to wait upon Siva, but though she made many attempts to winthe god’s attention he took no notice of her, and in the course of her effortsKama, the lovegod, who had done his best to help her to win him, was burntto ashes by the flames from Siva’s third eye. At last Plrvati decided tofollow the god in his asceticism. Laying aside her ornaments she became ahermitess on a nearby peak, and in this guise Śiva noticed her and fell inlove with her. They were married at a great ceremony at which all the godstook part, and soon Pārvatī gave birth to the war-god Skanda, who, when hegrew to manhood, destroyed the demon Taraka.In South India a rather similar story is told of the marriage of Siva andMinaksi, daughter of a Pandyan king of Madurai, and the event iscommemorated by one of the most famous and splendid of South Indiantemples.The Relation of Visnu and SivaThe Relations of Visnu and Siva From the beginning of the Christian era,if not before, most educated Hindus have been either Vaisnavites orSaivites-that is to say they have looked on either Visnu or giva as the highgod, or indeed as the only God, the others being merely secondaryexpressions of the divine, holding rather the same positions as the saints andangels in the mind of the Roman Catholic. Thus the Vaisnavite does notdeny the existence of Siva, but believes that he is merely one god amongmany, the creation or emanation of Visnu or of his demiurge Brahma. In thesame way the Śaivite looks on Visnu as an emanation of Siva. Occasionallythis difference of viewpoint has led to friction and some degree ofpersecution, but generally the two great divisions of Hinduism have rubbedalong happily together, in the conviction that, on ultimate analysis, both areequally right. Hinduism is essentially tolerant, and would rather assimilatethan rigidly exclude. So the wiser Vaisnavites and Saivites recognized veryearly that the gods whom they worshipped were different aspects of thesame divine being. The Divine is a diamond of innumerable facets; twovery large and bright facets are Visnu and Siva, while the others representall the gods that were ever worshipped. Some facets seem larger, brighter,and better polished than others, but in fact the devotee, whatever his sect,worships the whole diamond, which is in reality [Page 310] perfect. Themore devout Hindus, even when illiterate and ignorant, have always beenfundamentally monotheist. Thus in the Bhagavad Gita Krsna says:“If any worshipper do reverence with faithto any god whatever,I make his faith firm,and in that faith he reverences his god,and gains his desires,for it is I who bestow them.”61With this background of tolerance it is not surprising that attempts weremade to harmonize Vaisnavism and Śaivism. As early as Gupta times a holytrinity of Hinduism, the Trimūrti or triple form, was evolved, of Brahma thecreator, Visnu the preserver, and Viva the destroyer. The doctrine of theTrimūrti was occasionally popular in some circles, and is proclaimed in thefine hymn of Kalidasa, which inspired a once well-known poem ofEmerson:“Praise to you, O Trinity,one before creation,afterwards dividedin your three qualities!…“You, the one causeof death and life and birth,in your three formsproclaim your own glory…“In the cycle of your day and nightall things live and all things die.When you wake we live,when you sleep we perish….“Hard and soft, large and small,heavy and light, you are all things.You are both substance and form,ineffable in power….“You are the knower and the known,you are the eater and the food,you are the priest and the oblation,you are the worshipper and the prayer.” 62Early western students of Hinduism were impressed by the parallelbetween the Hindu trinity and that of Christianity. In fact the parallel is notvery close, and the Hindu trinity, unlike the Holy Trinity of Christianity,never really “caught on”. All Hindu trinitarianism [Page 311] tended tofavour one god of the three; thus, from the context it is clear that Kālidāsa’shymn to the Trimūrti is really addressed to Brahmi, here looked on as thehigh god. The Trimūrti was in fact an artificial growth, and had little realinfluence.Another significant syncretism was the god Harihara (Hari being a title ofVisnu and Hara of Śiva), worshipped in the form of an icon whichcombined characteristics of both gods. The cult of Harihara developed inthe middle ages, and had some success in the Deccan, where Hariharatemples were patronized by Vijayanagara kings, and where the god is stillworshipped.The Mother GoddessThe Mother Goddess Mother Goddesses were worshipped at all times inIndia, but between the days of the Harappā Culture and the Gupta periodthe cults of goddesses attracted little attention from the learned andinfluential, and only emerged from obscurity to a position of realimportance in the Middle Ages, when feminine divinities, theoreticallyconnected with the gods as their spouses, were once more worshipped bythe upper classes.The goddess was the śakti, the strength or potency of her malecounterpart. It was thought that the god was inactive and transcendent,while his female element was active and immanent, and by the Guptaperiod the wives of the gods, whose existence had always been recognized,but who had been shadowy figures in earlier theology, began to beworshipped in special temples. In the early 5th century an inscription ofWestern India tells of a certain Mayūrāksaka,“minister of the king, who established, to gain merit,this most awful temple,a temple filled with demonesses,…sacred to the Mothers, who shoutmost loudly in the thick darkness,where the lotuses are shakenby the fierce windsaroused by magic spells.”63From this time onwards the Mother Goddess increased in importance,until the wave of devotional Vaisnavism swept Northern India early in theMuslim period, and stopped the progress of her cult, which is still strong inBengal and Assam, and is known in other parts of India.The chief form of the Mother Goddess was that of the wife of Siva,called, in her benevolent aspect, Pārvatī (“Daughter of the Mountain”),Mahidevi (“the Great Goddess”), Sati (“the Virtuous”), [Page 312] Gaurī (”the White One”), Annapūrnā (” Bestower of Much Food”), or simply “theMother” ( Mātā, Tamil Ammai). In her grim aspect she was known as Durg(” Inaccessible”), Kali (“the Black One”), and Candī (“the Fierce”). Theterrible Tamil war-goddess Korravai, who danced among the slain on thebattlefield and ate their flesh, though independent in origin, was earlyidentified with her. In her fierce aspect she is often depicted as a horriblehag (pl. LXX), frequently with many arms bearing different weapons, withfierce carnivorous tusks, a red tongue lolling from her mouth, and a garlandof skulls. Her mount is a lion, and she is sometimes shown as a sternlybeautiful woman, slaying a buffalo-headed demon in the manner of St.George and the dragon (pl. XLIIb). The more gentle aspect of the goddessis that of a beautiful young woman, often portrayed with her lord Siva. Aninteresting iconographical development is that of the Ardhandrisvara, afigure half Śiva and half Pārvatī, representing the union of the god with hissakti. As Śiva is worshipped in the linga or phallic emblem, so Durgā isworshipped in the female emblem, or yoni. According to legend Pārvatī, inthe incarnation before that in which she became the bride of Siva, had beenborn as Sati, the daughter of the sage Daksa, and had then also become thewife of the great god. When her father quarrelled with her divine lord sheflung herself into the flames of his sacrificial fire, and the ashes of her yonifell in various spots in India, which became the pīthas, or sacred shrines ofher cult.Lesser GodsAs well as Visnu, Śiva and Durgā, many other gods were worshipped.Unlike the gods of the Veda, the new gods of Hinduism were no longerclosely tied to natural phenomena, but were thought of moreanthropomorphically.Brahmā, the Prajāpati of later Vedic times, had a history of slow decline.In the early Buddhist scriptures he and Indra were the greatest of the gods,and in the Mahābhārata he was still very important; but though depicted inmedieval sculpture, sometimes with four faces, he was little worshippedafter Gupta times. A single temple of Brahmā, by the sacred lake Puskaranear the modern Ajmer, is the only one known.The numerous solar deities of the Vedas were merged in Hinduism into asingle god, usually known as Sūrya (” the Sun”) (pl. XXXVII a). In Guptaand medieval times there existed numerous temples of the sun, especially inWestern India, which was open to Zoroastrian influence, and some of hisworshippers seem to have looked on him as the greatest god of all.Messrs Faber & Faber, Royal Academy Trustees and Birmingham Museum and Art GalleryColossal Bronze Buddha.

He had no independent cult, but was worshipped as one ofthe nine planets (p. 491). The cult of the planets was popularized by thegrowth of astrology in medieval times, and representations of them arefairly numerous.Indra, the Vedic war-god, lost much of his prestige but gained newattributes. Mounted on his elephant Airavata, he was guardian of the easternquarter of the universe, and ruler of one of the lower heavens, Amaravati.Under an alternative name, Sakra, perhaps originally a different god, he wasamong the chief divinities of early Buddhism, second only to Brahmā. Bythe Middle Ages he had few temples or worshippers.Varuna, the all-seeing god of the Vedas (p. 236ff), descended from hisheavenly palace to become a god of the waters, but he remained theguardian of the western quarter of the universe. The cult of Varunadisappeared early, though Tamil fishermen long worshipped a marine deity,called Varunaṉ, in the emblem of a “shark’s horn”. This god, however, isclearly an indigenous Tamil divinity who had acquired an Āryan name.Yama, guardian of the southern quarter, the death-god of the Vedas, wasstill remembered, though rarely if ever specially worshipped. His role hadsomewhat altered, for he was no longer the cheerful lord of paradise, but astern judge of the dead, ruling only over the purgatories where the wickedsuffered until their rebirth. The idea of a divine judge, theoreticallyunnecessary according to the doctrine of karma, may have been importedfrom the West, where it was known in many cults. Sometimes Yama, aidedby his clerk Citragupta, is described as weighing the deeds of the souls ofthe dead in a balance, rather like the Egyptian Thoth.The northern quarter was ruled by the god Kubera, lord of precious [Page314] metals, minerals, jewels, and wealth generally. This god, under thealternative name Vaiśravana, first appears briefly and faintly in later Vedicliterature, and is well known in Buddhism and Jainism. He dwells in thebeautiful jewelled city of Alaka, near Mount Kailasa, and commands hostsof gnomes ( guhyaka) and fairies ( yaksa). He is usually depicted as adwarfish figure with a large paunch. He was the object of a cult, though notof an important one.These four gods, Yama, Indra, Varuna and Kubera, were known asLokapālas, or Guardians of the Universe. In late texts four further guardiansof the intermediate quarters were added— Soma in the North-East, Vayu (thewind-god) in the North-West, Agni in the South-East, and Sūrya in theSouth-West. Of these Agni, the firegod, was still important at the time ofthe Epics, but he too lost much of his hold on the imagination in later times,while Vayu, the windgod, was a vague and tenuous deity, except in the lateschool of Madhva (p. 333).The war-god Skanda, also called Kumāra (“The Prince”), Kārtikeya and,in the South, Subrahmanya, was probably originally a non-Āryan divinity.He was the son of Śiva and Pārvatī and his sole function, according toorthodox tradition, was to slay the demon Taraka, which scarcely accountsfor his great popularity. From the beginning of the Christian era the cult ofSkanda was widespread in North India, though it declined somewhat inmedieval times. In the South it was even more important, for the name andattributes of the god were imposed on the chief deity of the ancient Tamils,Murugan, by which name Skanda is still sometimes known in the Tamilcountry. Murugan in his original form was a mountain god, worshipped inbacchanalian dances, at which he was impersonated by a medicine-manholding a spear ( velaṉ), whom the dancers identified with the god. Hearoused passion and erotic frenzy in girls and women, and the dances ofMurugan were evidently orgiastic. The Tamil Murugan was armed with aspear, and joined his fierce mother Korravai in her cannibal feasts on thebattlefield; hence his identification with the Āryan Skanda is not surprising,though Murugan’s original character as a fertility god is evident even today.Skanda is usually depicted as a handsome young man, often with six faces,mounted on a peacock.Ganesa or Ganapati (pl. LXIVc), “Chief of the Gaṇas” (a class ofdemigod attendant on Śiva), is the second son of Śiva and Pārvatī, and isone of the best known Indian divinities in the West. He has an elephant’shead with one broken tusk and a fat paunch, and he rides on a rat. Amongthe latest of the gods of the Hindu pantheon, he is not attested before the 5thcentury A.D., and was of little importance before the Middle Ages. Evidentlyhe is the survival of a primitive non-Aryan [Page 315] elephant god, but inHinduism he has become mild and cultured. He is the “Lord of Obstacles”( Vighnesvara), and is worshipped at the beginning of all undertakings toremove snags and hindrances. He is particularly interested in literary andeducational activities, and is the patron of grammarians; manuscripts andprinted books often begin with the auspicious formula Sri-Ganesayanamah, “Reverence to Lord Ganesa”. The cheerful and benevolentelephant-god was, and still is, revered by nearly every Hindu, whetherVaisnavite or Saivite. A small medieval sect looked on him as their chiefgod, but his status has generally been comparatively humble, thoughimportant.Hanumant, the monkey god, the son of Vayu and the friend and servantof Rāma, was no doubt a popular deity long before his incorporation in thepantheon. He is still an important village god, worshipped in many shrinesin the form of a monkey with more or less human body. He is a beneficentguardian spirit, and in his honour monkeys are generally looked on assacred.Kama (“Desire”), known by many other names and epithets, was theIndian love-god. Like his European counterpart he is depicted as ahandsome youth, armed with a bow and arrow, but the Indian Eros has abow of sugar-cane strung with a row of bees, and his arrows are flowers, Heis attended by a troop of nymphs ( apsarases), one of whom carries hisstandard, which bears a sea-monster. Kama is referred to in the “Hymn ofCreation”(p. 248) and in certain other Vedic passages as being the firstbornof the primeval chaos, but this kama is certainly not the Hindu love-god, butvaguely personified cosmic desire. On the strength of these early referencesit was generally believed by the theologians of Hinduism that Kama had noparents, but emerged spontaneously at the beginning of time to act as acatalyst in the universal process. His flowery arrows affect gods and menalike, and have only once been known to fail in their purpose-when Kamaattempted to rouse the passion of the great god Śiva, and was burnt to ashesfor his pains (p. 309), to be restored to life through the entreaties of hisfavourite wife, the goddess Rati (“Pleasure”). He is frequently referred to inliterature and was evidently a popular deity among young people of bothsexes, honoured at a great annual festival (p. 207). The Buddhist Mara (“theSmiter”), was sometimes identified with Kama but had sinister attributes,and was a sort of Satan, the personification of the world, the flesh and thedevil. His temptation of the Buddha is one of the most famous episodes ofBuddhist legend.All the gods have complementary goddesses, their wives, but most ofthese are pale reflexions of their lords, bearing the same names withfeminine terminations (e.g. Indrāṇ ī, Brahmāṇ ī, etc.). They [Page 316] wereoften worshipped in a group, usually of seven, to which the gods Kartikeyaand Ganesa were sometimes added, and portrayals of these goddesses(Mātrkā, Ambikā, “the Little Mothers”) are fairly common in medievalsculpture (pl. LXIVc). As well as Durga, who must rank as one of the threechief deities of Hinduism, other goddesses were important, however.Laksmi (“Fortune “), the wife of Visnu, also often called Sri, was thegoddess of good luck and temporal blessing. In some legends she is said tobe coexistent with Viṣṇu, but according to others she appeared in her fullbeauty, like Aphrodite, at the churning of the primeval ocean (p. 302). Sheis usually portrayed as a woman of mature beauty, seated on a lotus andoften with a lotus in her hand, attended by two elephants, who sprinklewater on her from their trunks. Though never an object of a special cult, hericons are numerous, and she was much worshipped as a subsidiary deity.She was believed to incarnate herself as the wife of the incarnation ofViṣṇu, and thus she was worshipped as Sītā, the spouse of Rāma, asRukmiṇī, the chief queen of Krsna, or as Radha, the favourite of his youth.Sarasvatī (pl. Lb), the wife of Brahmā, had an autonomous role as thepatron of art, music and letters. In the Ṛ g Veda she was a sacred river, but inlater Vedic literature was identified with a hypostatic goddess of temporaryimportance, Vac (” Speech “). She was depicted as a beautiful fair youngwoman, often with a vīṇā, or Indian lute, and a book in her hand, andattended by a swan.24 Traditionally she was the inventor of the Sanskritlanguage and the Devanagari script. Sarasvati has always been worshippedby students, writers and musicians, and her cult is still maintained.Demigods and SpiritsAs well as these greater gods there were an infinite number of lesserones. Every village had its local god or goddess ( gramade-vatā), often arude image or fetish, set up under a sacred tree. Some of these villagefertility deities, through a process of assimilation, attained widespreadpopularity. Local goddesses were often vaguely identified with Durga, butwere never thoroughly incorporated into the mythological scheme, orprovided with husbands, and they maintained an autonomous existence onthe fringes of the orthodox pantheon. Chief of such goddesses was Śītalā(“the Cool”), called in the Tamil country Mariyammai (“Mother Death”),the goddess of smallpox, worshipped for prevention and cure, especially bymothers on behalf of their children. Similarly the snake-goddess Manasa[Page 317] (pl. XLV b) protected from snakebite. A male deity of this type,widely popular in the Tamil countryside from ancient days, was Aiyanar, abeneficent guardian deity much revered by peasants, and sometimesthought of as a son of Siva. The cities of ancient India, like those of theclassical world, had their guardian deities, who might be importantmembers of the pantheon, but were often of only local significance. Besidesthese local gods the world was full of demigods and spirits, good and evil.The snake-spirits ( Nāga) (pl. XLIb), half-human, but with a serpent’s tail,were very ancient objects of worship. They dwelt in the beautifulunderground city of Bhogavati, and guarded great treasures, some of whichthey occasionally bestowed on mortals whom they favoured. They couldtake wholly human form, and more than one dynasty of ancient Indiaclaimed descent from the union of a human hero and a nāginī. Probably theprototypes of the nagas were the dark primitive tribes, met by the Aryans intheir expansion over India, for a primitive people called Nagas exists inAssam to this day; but the cult of serpents is so widespread in India that thenagas must certainly owe much to aboriginal snake cults.The Yakṣ as, especially associated with the god Kubera, were a sort ofgnome or fairy, worshipped by country people. Before the Christian eratheir cult was widespread, but.they lost their significance as the great godsof Hinduism became more widely worshipped. They were generally lookedon as friendly to men, but their womenfolk might sometimes be malevolent,and ate little children.The Gandharvas survived from Vedic times as servants of Indra andheavenly musicians. Associated with them, and sometimes thought of as asubdivision of their order, were the Kinnaras, also heavenly musicians, whohad human heads and horses’ bodies, and thus resembled the classicalcentaurs, with whom they may be connected.The Gandharvas were all male. Their female counterparts were theApsarases, in Vedic times connected with water, but later translated toheaven. They were beautiful and libidinous, and specially delighted intempting ascetics in their meditations. Thus Menaka the apsaras seduced thegreat sage Visvamitra, and conceived Sakuntala, the heroine of Kālidasā’sfamous drama (p. 435ff). Another apsaras famous in story was Urvaśī, theheroine of another drama of Kalidasa, the story of whose love for the mortalking Puriiravas (p.405 ff) is as old as the Ṛ g Veda. Sometimes the apsarasesappear in the role of valkyries, raising slain heroes from the battlefield andbearing them to heaven to be their lovers.A further group of demigods was that of the Vidyādharas or [Page 318]heavenly magicians, mysterious beings who lived in magic cities in the highHimalayas. Like the Vedic munis (p. 243) they could fly through the air andtransform themselves at will, and they were generally favourable to men.The Rsis (” sages “or more literally “seers “), were the composers of theVedic hymns, and other legendary wise men of olden times, who had beentranslated to heaven, where they enjoyed a status comparable to that of thegods. Chief of these were the “Seven Rsis”, identified with the stars of theGreat Bear-Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha.Other important rsis were Kaśyapa and Daksa, said in some stories to havebeen the progenitors of gods and men; Narada, who invented the vīnā andwas a sort of patron saint of music; Visvamitra, a ksatriya who by his pietyand asceticism raised himself to brāhman status, and who is heard of inmany legends; Brhaspati, the preceptor of gods and demons, who began hiscareer in Vedic times as a god, but whose status fell to that of a ṛṣi, whowas also identified with the planet Jupiter (pl. LIIIb), and who is said tohave founded the materialist system of philosophy and the science ofstatecraft; and Agastya, who taught the Southerners religion and culture.Somewhat less exalted than the rsis were the Siddhas, a large class of saintswho had won a place for themselves in heaven by their piety.Chief among evil spirits were the Asuras, or demons. The word asurawas in Vedic times applied to certain gods (p. 236), but in Hinduism it isused for a group of heavenly spirits who are continually at war with thegods, whose power they sometimes shake, but never conquer. Moreimmediately dangerous to men were the various classes of goblin, such asthe Raksasas, most famous of whom was Rāvaṇa the ten-headed demonking of Laṇkā (Ceylon), whom Rama defeated and killed. Few raksasas hadthe same power as Rāvaṇa, but all were frightful and dangerous, takingterrible forms and lurking in dark places at night, to kill and eat men andotherwise distress them. Somewhat less terrible were the Piśācas, who, likethe nagas, may have had a material basis in a wild tribe, since a very basedialect of Prākrit was attributed to them. Both these classes of demonhaunted battlefields, charnel grounds, and places of violent death, as did aspecial class of demon, the Vetala, or vampire, which took up its abode incorpses. Finally the night was haunted by ghosts ( preta, bhuta), the nakedspirits of those who had died violent deaths, and for whom sraddha had notbeen performed. These miserable beings were very dangerous to men,particularly to their own surviving relatives.

Hindu worship was not confined to the propitiation of gods and [Page319] demigods, for the whole of nature was in some sense divine. Great andholy men were reverenced, both during their lives and for long after theirdeaths, for they contained a portion of godhead. Thus the sixty-threeNāyaṉars of Tamil Śaivism and the twelve Alvars of Tamil Vaisnavism stillenjoy the status of demigods, as do other great religious teachers amongtheir followers.

Not only men, but animals and plants were and still are holy, notably, ofcourse, the cow. According to one legend the cow Surabhi, the mother of allcows, was one of the treasures churned from the cosmic ocean. The “fiveproducts of the cow” ( pancagavya)—milk, curd, butter, urine and dung-were all of great purifying potency, especially when combined in a singlemixture. Despite her sanctity, there was no cow-goddess, and Surabhi andthe various “wishingcows” of legend, by milking which all desires werefulfilled, had no temples in their honour. The living beast was revered, notas representative of any deity, but in her own right. The bull, on the otherhand, received honour largely as the mount of Siva; the image of Nandi isfound in most Śaivite temples and honoured with occasional offerings.

After the cow the snake was perhaps the most revered animal of ancient India. Legendary serpents, such as Śesa (p. 300) and Vasuki (p. 302), gave the snake prestige, but the cult no doubt sprang from very primitive levels,since the deadly snake is revered all over the world by uncivilized peoplesas an emblem of both death and fertility. An offering to snakes, made at thebeginning of the rainy season, was part of the regular domestic ritual ofHinduism. Anthills were respected as the home of snakes. Other animals,though associated with various divinities, played little part in Hindu cults.

The monkey, now much revered by peasants and simple folk in many parts of India, is not referred to as specially sacred in early Hindu texts.

Tree cults, common the world over among ancient peoples, were widespread in India, where each village had its sacred tree or grove. Specially sacred were the pippala or aśvattha (pīpal, Ficus religiosa), thesanctity of which spread to Buddhism, and the vaṭa or nyagrodha, thebanyan (Ficus indica), the secondary roots of which, reaching down from itsbranches, formed the basis of much religious symbolism. Many other treeswere more or less sacred, notably the aśoka (p. 202), to which womenprayed for children. There were also sacred plants, such as the tulasī, a typeof basil, which was sacred to Visnu, and which is still grown in thecourtyard of many Hindu homes and tended with great care. Two types ofgrass, kuśa and darbha, were also sacred from Vedic times onwards. TheVedic soma plant, however, was forgotten.[Page 320] Every hill or mountain had some degree of sanctity,especially the Himalayas, which were the foothills of Mount Meru, thecentre of the world. Around Meru, on mountains which reached to theheavens, dwelt the gods. Vaikuntha, the home of Visnu, was neversatisfactorily identified, but Kailasa, the mountain of Śiva, was recognizedas a certain peak in the Central Himalayas which has long been a place ofpilgrimage. Numerous other mountains and hills in many parts of Indiawere famous for their sanctity. Even rocks often had a religioussignificance, especially if upright and vaguely resembling the linga of Śiva.

The ammonite ( śālagrāma), a fossilized shellfish, was recognized as one of the symbols of Visnu.

Rivers were also sacred, especially, of course, the Ganges ( Ganga),which sprang from the foot of Visnu, flowed over the sky in the form of themilky way ( Mandākinī), and then fell to earth from the matted locks ofŚiva. Ganga was often personified as a goddess in her own right, like hergreat tributary Yamunā, the Jamnā. Other rivers held specially sacred werethe Sarasvatī, which was believed to flow underground and join the Gangesat her confluence with the Jamna at Prayaga (Allahābād), the Narmadā, theGodāvarī, the Krsnā (modern Krstnā) and the Kāviri. Certain lakes, notablyManasa in the high Himalayas near Mount Kailasa, and Puskara, nearAjmer, were also sacred, and even cities were divine (p. 200, n).

### Cosmogony
Hindu cosmology was slow in evolving, and in its final form was perhaps later than the cosmology of the Buddhists and Jainas. According to this system the cosmos passes through cycles within cycles for all eternity. The basic cycle is the kalpa, a “day of Brahmā”, or 4,320 million earthly years.

His night is of equal length. 360 such days and nights constitute a “year of Brahmā” and his life is 100 such years long.25 The largest cycle is therefore 311,040,000 million years long, after which the whole universe returns to the ineffable world-spirit, until another creator god is evolved.26 In each cosmic day the god creates the universe and again absorbs it.

During the cosmic night he sleeps, and the whole universe is gathered up into his body, where it remains as a potentiality. Within each kalpa are fourteen manvantaras, or secondary cycles, each lasting 306,720,000 years, with long intervals between them. In these periods the world is recreated, and a new Manu appears, as the progenitor [Page 321] of the human race.

We are now in the seventh manvantara of the kalpa, of which the Manu is known as Manu Vaivasvata.

Each manvantara contains seventy-one Mahāyugas, or æons, of which a thousand form the kalpa. Each Mahāyuga is in turn divided into four yugas or ages, called Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali (p. 207). Their lengths arerespectively 4,800, 3,600, 2,400, and 1,200 “years of the gods”, each ofwhich equals 360 human years. Each yuga represents a progressive declinein piety, morality, strength, stature, longevity and happiness. We are atpresent in the Kali-yuga, which began, according to tradition, in 3102 B.C.,believed to be the year of the Mahābhārata War.

The end of the Kali-yuga, according to many epic passages, is marked by confusion of classes, the overthrow of established standards, the cessation of all religious rites, and the rule of cruel and alien kings. Soon after this theworld is destroyed by flood and fire. This view is propounded strongly intexts which date from about the beginning of the Christian era, when alienkings did in fact rule much of India, and established practices were shakenby heresies such as Buddhism and Jainism. An earlier tradition would placethe Mahābhārata War c. 900 B.C. (p. 39), according to which the 1,200 years of the Kali-yuga, if read as human years and not as “years of the gods “, would at this time be nearing their end. Evidently some pious Hindus thought that the dissolution of the cosmos was imminent. Perhaps it is to the departure of this fear in later times that we must attribute the devising of the “years of the gods “, which made the dissolution of the world comfortably distant. Most medieval texts state that the cosmic dissolution occurs only after the last cycle of the kalpa, and that the transition from one æon to the next takes place rapidly and calmly; the expectation of the Kalkin (p. 307), who will not destroy but regenerate the world, could not otherwise be harmonized with the scheme of the yugas. In this, its final form, the Hindu system of world-cycles is clearly an imperfect synthesis of more than one independent doctrine; the manvantaras, especially, do not fit tidily into the scheme, and must surely be derived from a source different from that of the Mahāyugas.

The system of the four yugas immediately brings to mind the four ages of
ancient Greece-and indeed the Indian yugas are sometimes named after
metals-gold, silver, copper and iron. A similar doctrine of four ages existed
in ancient Persia, and the three schemes may have been borrowed from a
common source.

The act of creation was thought of in more than one manner. The school
called Sāṉ khya (p. 324f) and some lesser schools postulated the existence
of primeval matter ( prakrti), of which the creator made use [Page 322] to
form the world, but the Vedanta school, certainly the most influential in the
Middle Ages, maintained that everything in the universe, souls and matter
alike, was produced from God’s own essence. The motive of creation was
explained by the Vedanta school as the “sport” ( līlā) of the World Soul, and


the creation of the cosmos was thought of on the analogy of the production
of a work of art from the mind of an artist.

The Soul, Karma and Samsara
The doctrine of karma, elaborated in Upanisadic times and adopted by
Buddhism and Jainism, was also part and parcel of Hinduism. According to
the Hindu definition karma (literally “work,” or “deed”) was the unseen
ripening of past actions, and though not in Hinduism a substantial category,
as in Jainism, it was thought of as accumulating and dispersing. Through
karma the body of the next life, divine, human, animal or hellish, was
acquired; and on previous karma depended a man’s character, fortune and
social class, and his happiness and sorrow. Every good act brought its
result, sooner or later, in happiness, and every evil act in sorrow. Some
Hindu philosophies even thought it theoretically possible to draw up a sort
of karmic balance sheet.

The belief in karma does not necessarily involve fatalism. A fatalist
strain often appeared in Hindu thought, but most teachers disapproved of it.

Our present condition is inevitable, but only because of the karma accruing from our past deeds. We cannot escape the law of karma any more than we can escape the law of gravity or the passage of time, but by judgement and forethought we can utilize karma to our own advantage.

The process of transmigration was interpreted somewhat variously, but all schools agreed that the soul does not transmigrate in a state of nudity, but with a sheath or series of sheaths of subtle matter; the condition of the sheaths depends on the balance of previous good and evil karma, and the new birth is determined by the nature of the sheaths which surround thesoul. The subtle body of transmigration is deprived of sense-organs,including mind, the sixth sense, and therefore the soul cannot normallyremember previous births or the passage from one body to another. Veryadvanced souls, however, can sometimes recapture memories of previousexistences, and some sects evolved a special technique for doing so. Soulsare liable to transmigration throughout the life of the god Brahmā, though atthe end of each cosmic day, or kalpa, they return to his body aspotentialities only. On the death of Brahmā, at the final dissolution of theuniverse at the end of a hundred Brahmā-years, [Page 322] they areabsorbed into the World Spirit and their karma is annihilated.

Saṃsāra, the continual passage from body to body, often compared to an ever-rolling wheel, is infinitely tedious, and Hinduism inherited the desire for release from transmigration which was almost universal in Indian thought. Conceptions of the state of release or salvation ( mukti) and the means of obtaining it differed widely.

## The Six Systems of Salvation
Early in the Christian era, if not before, there was a theoretical classification of the various schools of thought looked on as orthodox, and the Saddariana or “Six Doctrines” became a regular feature of Hinduism.

The Six Schools were actually of differing origin and purpose, but all were brought into the scheme by being treated as equally valid ways of salvation.

They were divided into three groups of two, which were thought to be related and complementary. These were: Nyāya and Vaiśeṣ ika; Sā khya and Yoga; and Mī;māmsā and Vedānta.

Nyāya (“Analysis”) was rather a school of logic and epistemology than of theology. It looked back to a teacher, Aksapada Gautama, the Sūtras or aphorisms attributed to whom are probably no earlier than the Christian era.

Logic was forced into the scheme as a means of salvation by the contention that clear thinking and logical argument were essential means to the highest bliss, and thus a religious basis was given to what was essentially a system of reasoning (p. 50 if).

Vaisesika (“the School of Individual Characteristics”) was complementary to Nyāya, and perhaps older, and in medieval times the two merged into what was virtually a single school. While Nyaya specialized inlogic, Vaisesika was rather interested in physics than theology. The earliesttext of the school is the Sūtras of the legendary founder, Ulūka Kanāda,which had numerous exponents and commentators, the greatest of whomwas Prasastapada of the 5th century. The basic tenet of Vaisesika, held incommon with Jainism and some schools of Buddhism, was that nature isatomic. The atoms are distinct from the soul, of which they are theinstrument. Each element has individual characteristics ( visesas), whichdistinguish it from the four other non-atomic substances ( dravyas), whichthe school recognizes-time, space, soul and mind. The atoms are eternal, butin the great dissolution at the end of the life of Brahmā they are separatedone from another, and all things are destroyed. The new Brahma utilizes theold atoms to create the world afresh. Vaisesika thus postulated a dualism ofmatter and soul, and declared that [Page 324] salvation depends on fullyrecognizing the atomic nature of the universe, and its difference from thesoul. 27

Sāṅ khya (“the Count”) is perhaps the oldest of the six systems, beingmentioned in the Bhagavad Gītā and occurring in a primitive form in theUpaniṣads. Its legendary founder was the ancient sage Kapila, but theearliest surviving text of the system is the Sāṅ khyakārikā of Iśvarakrsna,perhaps of the 4th century A.D. Sāṅkhya resembles Jainism in its rigiddualism and fundamental atheism. It teaches the existence of twenty-fivebasic principles ( tattva), of which the first is prakrti-a term usually looselytranslated “matter”. Creation, or rather evolution, is not due to the operationof a divinity, but to the inherent nature of prakrti. From prakrti develops (2)Intelligence ( buddhi, also called mahat “the Great One”), and hence isproduced (3) Self-consciousness ( ahankṅ ra). Prakrti has in fact evolvedinto an active divinity. Through self-consciousness emerge the five subtleelements ( tanmātra), invisible matter in its most ethereal form; the five are(4) “ether” ( ākāśa), (5) air, (6) light, (7) water and (8) earth. From the subtleelements the material elements ( mahābhāta) emerge (9–13). Working onthis material, Self-consciousness then produces the five organs of sense(jnānendriya): (14) hearing, (15) touch, (16) sight, (17) taste and (18) smell,and the five of action ( karmendriya): (19) speech, (20) grasping, (21)walking, (22) evacuation and (23) procreation. Each of these organscorresponds to an element, in respective order. Finally Self-consciousnessproduces the twenty-fourth of the basic components of the world, mind( manas), looked on as a sixth sense, which acts as intermediary between allthe ten organs and the outside world. This remarkable and fantastic doctrineof cosmic evolution, interpreted in simple terms, implies that bodies, andindeed the whole cosmos, are products of the ego ( ahahnkra), conceived asbasically material.But there is another tattva, the twenty-fifth. This is Purusa, literally “thePerson”, the soul. As in Jainism, there is an infinite number of souls in theuniverse, all equal, eternally inactive spectators of the evolution of prakṛti.Purusa is not dependent on prakrti nor prakṛti on puruṣa—a universe isconceivable completely devoid of soul and yet evolving in the same way asthe universe we know, for intelligence, personality and mind are not parts ofthe soul. Yet the souls in some way become involved in matter, and theirsalvation lies in realizing their difference from it.

A very important feature of Sāṅkhya metaphysics is the doctrine of the
three constituent qualities ( guna), causing virtue ( sattva), passion [Page325] ( rajas) and dullness ( tamas). In its undeveloped state cosmic mattercontains these three in equilibrium, but as the world evolves one or other ofthe three preponderates in different objects or beings, and the proportionsaccount for the values of the universe. Sattva guṇ a, the quality of virtue, ispresent in all things tending to truth, wisdom, beauty and goodness; thequality of passion inheres in all that is fierce, violent, energetic, forceful oractive; while dullness is found in what is dark, stupid, gloomy, wretched orunhappy. This threefold classification affected many aspects of Indian lifeand thought and its influence reached far beyond the Sāṅikhya schoolwhich made it its own.

The dualism of soul and matter and the fundamental atheism of Sāṅkhyawere somewhat modified in the Middle Ages as a concession to theprevalent monism and theism. Purusa literally means “person” or “man”,and prakrti is of feminine gender. It is not surprising that the latter waspersonified as the wife of the former, especially by the tantric sects. Theinactive purusa of the earlier system became a generator, and the cold andrather pedantic Sāṅkhya, in a much modified form, became the commonproperty of popular Indian religion of later times.

Yoga, the name of the fourth system, is a word well known in the West,and is connected etymologically with the English word “yoke”. It may befreely translated “spiritual discipline” or “application “. The term is looselyused to imply all the religious exercises and acts of self-mortification ofIndian religion, the earnest follower of such practices being a yogī. In thisbroad sense yoga has been part of the teaching of every Indian sect, but itwas also the name of a distinct school, which emphasized psychic trainingas the chief means of salvation. The basic text of this school is the YogaSūtras of Patañjali; this teacher was traditionally identified with a famousgrammarian believed to have lived in the 2nd century B.C., but the Sūtras intheir present form are probably several centuries later.

The metaphysical ideas of the Yoga school were originally closely akin to those of Sāṅkhya, but they differed in that they brought a deity into the picture. The God ( Iśvara) of Yoga was not a creator, but a specially exaltedsoul, which had existed for all eternity without ever being enmeshed inmatter. Thus the god of Yoga resembled the Buddha of the Lesser Vehicle,or the glorified Tīrthaikara of Jainism, never coming in contact with hisworshippers, but invaluable as an example. He was specially symbolized inthe sacred syllable OM, which in the Yoga school was much revered, asgiving insight into the sublime purity of the soul and thus aiding meditation.

A Yoga [Page 326] theism soon developed, however, and the God of later Yoga texts differs little from that of other schools.
The course of training of the yogī was divided into eight stages, reminding us of the eightfold path of Buddhism, but far less practical:
(1) Self-control ( yama), the practice of the five moral rules: non- violence, truthfulness, not stealing, chastity, and the avoidance of greed.
(2) Observance ( niyama), the regular and complete observance of the above five rules.
 (3) Posture ( āsana), sitting in certain postures, difficult without practice,
which are thought to be essential to meditation. The most famous of these is padmāsna, the “Lotus Posture”, in which the feet are placed on the opposite thighs, and in which gods and sages are commonly depicted.
(4) Control of the Breath ( prānāyāma), whereby the breath is held and controlled and the respiration forced into unusual rhythms, which are believed to be of great physical and spiritual value.
(5) Restraint ( pratyāhāra), whereby the sense organs are trained to take no note of their perceptions.
(6) Steadying the Mind ( dhāranā), by concentration on a single object, such as the tip of the nose, the navel, an icon, or a sacred symbol.
(7) Meditation ( dhyāna), when the object of concentration fills the whole mind.
(8) Deep Meditation ( samādhi), when the whole personality is temporarily dissolved.

Yoga was sometimes developed in special and rather dubious ways,especially by the tantric schools of the Middle Ages. The course of trainingoutlined above was known as “Royal Yoga” ( rājayoga), but other yogasystems developed, such as the “Yoga of Spells” ( mantrayoga), whichtaught the continual repetition of magic syllables and phrases as a means ofdissociating the consciousness; the “Yoga of Force” ( hathayoga), whichemphasized the importance of physical means such as special acrobaticexercises and very difficult postures, and sometimes advocated sexual unionas a means of salvation; and the “Yoga of Dissolution”( layayoga), oftenidentified with hathayoga, based on certain ancient Indian physiologicalnotions, which play a big part in the form of yoga sometimes taught byWestern practitioners.The chief vein of the body, known as suśumna, runs through the spinalcolumn. Along it at different points are six “wheels” ( cakra), orconcentrations of psychic energy. At the top of the vein susumna, within theskull, is sahasrāra, a specially powerful psychic centre symbolically referredto as a lotus. In the lowest “wheel”, behind the genitals, is the kundalini, the“serpent power”, generally in a quiescent state. By yogic practices thekundalinl is awakened, rises [Page 327] through the vein susumna, passesthrough all the six “wheels” of psychic force, and unites with the topmostsahasrāra. By awakening and raising his kundalini the yogī gains spiritualpower, and by uniting it with sahasrāra he wins salvation.The awakened kundalini gives to the yogī superhuman power andknowledge, and many yogīs have practised yoga rather for this than forsalvation. Some adepts of this form of yoga have developed powers whichcannot fully be accounted for by European medical science and whichcannot be explained away as subjective, but the physiological basis of laya-and hatha-yoga is certainly false; there is no kundalini, susumna orsahasrāra. The ancient mystical physiology of India needs further study,not only by professional Indologists, but by open-minded biologists andpsychologists, who may reveal the true secret of the yogī. For whatever wemay think about his spiritual claims there is no doubt that the advanced yogīcan hold his breath for very long periods without suffering injury, cancontrol the rhythm of his own heart-beats, can withstand extremes of heatand cold, can remain healthy on a starvation diet, and, despite his austereand frugal life and his remarkable physical contortions, which would ruinthe system of any ordinary man, can often survive to a very advanced agewith full use of his faculties.Mimāmsa (“Enquiry”), differed in origin from the other systems in that itwas not so much a school of salvation as of exposition. Its original purposewas to explain the Vedas, and it was virtually a survival of brahmanism.The earliest work of the school is the Sūtras of Jaimini (perhaps of the 2ndcentury B.C.), which set out to show that the Vedas are eternal, self-existent,and wholly authoritative, and to defend their authenticity against all comers.This led to some development of logic, dialectics and semantics in theschool. Sabarasvamin (? 6th century) the greatest of Mīmāmsā scholars, hadmuch to say on law. It was only in the 7th and 8th centuries that the schooldeveloped a full philosophy of salvation, according to which respect for theVedas and observance of their rules were essential first steps on the road.By the time of Kumarila (8th century) the Mimamsa school was beginningto merge with the Vedanta.Vedānta (“the End of the Vedas”), also called Uttara Mīmāmsā (“later
Mīmāmsā “), is the most important of the six systems, and, in its many sub-
schools, it has produced the characteristic features of modern intellectualHinduism. The basic text of the system is the Brahma Sūtras ofBadarayana, written early in the Christian era, which have been commentedon by many scholars of all ages, down to the present day. Vedanta is still aliving school, and modem theologians and mystical [Page 328] teacherssuch as Vivekananda and Aurobindo Ghose, and philosophers such as Sir S.

Radhakrishnan, are all Vedantists. The doctrines of Vedanta were based on
the Upanisads, and gave logical and organized form to their many mysticalspeculations. The classical Vedanta is that of the great philosopher Śaṅkara(? 788–820), a South Indian Śaivite brāhman, who in a short lifetimecomposed extensive commentaries on the Brahmā Sūtras and the chiefUpanisads, travelled all over India preaching his doctrines, and founded anorder of Hindu monks.

Śaṅkara was an orthodox brāhman, for whom all the Vedic literature was
sacred and unquestionably true. To harmonize its many paradoxes he hadrecourse to an expedient already known in Buddhism (p. 279), that of adouble standard of truth. On the everyday level of truth the world wasproduced by Brahmā, and went through an evolutionary process similar tothat taught by the Sāṅkhya school from which Śaṅkara took over thedoctrine of the three guṇas. But on the highest level of truth the whole

phenomenal universe, including the gods themselves, was unreal-the worldwas Maya, illusion, a dream, a mirage, a figment of the imagination.Ultimately the only reality was brāhman, the impersonal World Soul of theUpanisads, with which the individual soul was identical. As in theUpanisads, salvation was to be obtained by recognition of this identitythrough meditation. Sankara’s brāhman is not really different from the“Void” or the Nirvana of Mahayana Buddhism (p. 277), a fact wellrecognized by Sankara’s opponents, who called him a crypto-Buddhist.Śaṅkara’s greatness lies in his brilliant dialectic. By able use of logicalargument, and, we must admit, by interpreting some phrases veryfiguratively, he reduced all the apparently self-contradictory passages of theUpanisads to a consistent system which, though not unchallenged, hasremained the standard philosophy of intellectual Hinduism to this day. Thecomparison of Śaṅkara in Hinduism with St. Thomas Aquinas in theRoman Catholic Church is a very fair one.The doctrine of Śaṅkara is often known as advaita (“allowing nosecond”, i.e. monism) or kevalādvaita (strict monism).

## Theism and Devotion
The sect of the Bhāgavatas, worshippers of Vasudeva, identified withKrsna and Visnu, was active at least a century before Christ. A little laterarose a sect of Pasupatas, devotees of Pasupati, or Śiva. We know littleabout the early history of these sects, but it is certain that they were theistic,and stressed the merits of worship rather than of sacrifice. In the MiddleAges their doctrines were given a philosophy.

A widespread Vaisnavite school, known as the Pāñcarātra (“Five [Page
329] Nights”, of uncertain significance), gave a cosmological basis to themyths of Vasudeva-Krsna, by identifying him and his family with cosmicemanations, and thus building a system of evolution similar to those of themore orthodox six systems, of which we have described the Sāṅkhyan as atypical example. From Vasudeva, identified with Visnu, the ultimatepersonal godhead, developed Sankarsana (another name of Kṛsna’s brotherBalarama) at the beginning of time; this emanation was identified withprakrti, or primal matter. The two produced Pradyumna (Krsna’s son)identified with manas or mind; thence arose Aniruddha (Kṛsna’s grandson)who was self-consciousness ( ahaṅ kāra). Only then did the three gunasevolve, and with them Brahmā the demiurge.

In the Pāñcarātra system Safikarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are notmerely aspects of the divine character, but gods in their own right, as theywere with the early Bhagavatas. The gods are thus simultaneously one andmany. There is no question here of different levels of truth, as in Śaṅkara’ssystem, but of an eternal paradox. The soul is one with God, but at the sametime it is an individual. Even in the state of full salvation it retains enoughindividuality to realize the bliss of union with the godhead. The Pāñcarātradoctrine of emanations ( vyśha) may have developed in Kashmir, where it isbelieved that the earliest texts of the school were written; but it found acomplementary development in the Tamil country, where a great growth ofdevotional religion was taking place at the same time.

The devotion ( bhakti) of the early Bhāgavatas, as exemplified in the Bhagavad Gītā, had been somewhat restrained in its expression. By the lessspiritually developed worshipper the god was probably not realized as anever-present and indwelling spirit, but as a mighty and rather distant king,to be adored from afar. This is the spirit of the Gupta hymn to the Sunquoted above (p. 313) and even in general of the Bhagavad Gītā itself.

When Kṛsna reveals himself as the supreme god and shows his transcendent form, Arjuna falls to the ground in terror, unable to bear theawful splendour of the theophany. The god admittedly states that he is inthe heart of all beings, that he raises his worshippers from the sea oftransmigration, and that they are very dear to him; but he is still rather GodTranscendent than God Immanent. Arjuna compares Kṛsna’s relation to himto that of friend and friend, father and son, lover and beloved; but his chieffeeling at the revelation of Kṛsna’s divinity is one of awe:“You are the father of the universe, of all that moves and all that moves not,its worshipful and worthy teacher.

You have no equal-what in the three worlds could equal you, O power
beyond compare?

[Page 330] “So, reverently prostrating my body,
I crave your grace, O blessed lord.

As father to son, as friend to friend, as lover to beloved,
bear with me, God.

“I rejoice that I have seen what none has seen before,
but my mind trembles with fear.

Graciously show me again your earthly form,
Lord of the Gods, Home of the World.” 65
Thus the early bhakti was inspired by feelings rather of respect than of
love. Divine grace was the condescension of a mighty potentate, ster and
functional. His glory was the glory of an emperor, which the ordinary
mortal could hardly contemplate.

Buddhism may have influenced the new form of piety which appeared in medieval times, for the concept of the Bodhisattva, looking down in love and pity and helping all creation, was probably earlier than any comparableidea in Hinduism. But the new form of devotion seems to have developedfirst in the Tamil country. One of its earliest expressions is a remarkablepoem of the collection called the “Ten Odes “, almost certainly earlier thanthe 7th century. This is the “Guide to the Lord Murugan “, a description ofthe chief shrines of the old Tamil god, which the worshipper is advised tovisit in turn. Throughout most of the poem the god retains his wild andprimitive character, with the attributes of the northern Skanda added (p.314); but at last the worshipper meets him face to face.

“When you see his face, praise him with joy,
worship him with joined palms, bow before him,
so that his feet touch your head….

“Holy and mighty will be his form,
rising to heaven, but his sterner face
will be hidden, and he will show you
the form of a young man, fragrant and beautiful;
and his words will be loving and gracious—
‘Don’t be afraid—I knew you were coming!’”66
Here surely we find a new conception of godhead struggling to express
itself, the idea of a god who feels an intense love for men, and to whom the
worshipper can return the same love. This found its first full expression in
the hymns of the early Tamil devotees ( Nāyanārs and Ālvārs), which are
among India’s greatest contributions to the world’s religious literature.

The devotion of the Tamil hymnodists is no longer reverence for atranscendent deity, but ecstatic love for an immanent one. The love [Page331] of God, moreover, is reflected by the worshipper in love for hisfellows. In the Tamil word aṉ bu we have something more closelyapproaching the Christian virtue of love than any Sanskrit term. Moreoverthe Tamil devotees often worshipped their God with a deep sense of sin andinadequacy, which is rarely to be found in contemporary Āryan religiousliterature, and recalls the Vedic hymns to Varuna.

“You are father, you are mother,
you are elder brother,
you are all kinsmen,
you are fair women, and abundant riches.

You are family, friends and home,
fount of pure wisdom, of wisdom to press onward.

You are gold, you are jewel, you are pearl—
You are lord, Rider on the Bull,28 you are bliss.” 67
“‘O most desired, O king, O lord, eternal form,
my fortune, supreme mystic!’ Thus I sang each day.

My gold! My hill of coral! in love of you …
I have journeyed far to see the bright flower of your feet.”68
“A sinner, I have left the way of love and service.

Too well I have known the meaning of sickness and pain.

I will go now and worship.

How foolish I have been! How long can I be parted
from my pearl, my mighty jewel, my diamond, Lord of the
shrine of Ārūr?”69
“He whom the King of Gods knows but in part, the God of
Gods,
The triple Lord, who makes, preserves and ends
the lovely universe, the Primal Form,
the Ancient of Days, the Lord of Pārvatī,…
came in his grace and took me for his own,
so now I bow to none, and revere him alone.

I am among the servants of his servants,
and I shall bathe in joy, and dance and sing.” 70
“Into my vile body of
flesh you came, as though it were a temple of gold,
and soothed me wholly and saved me,
O Lord of Grace, O Gem Most Pure.

Sorrow and birth and death and illusion
you took from me, and set me free.

O Bliss! O Light! I have taken refuge in you,
and never can I be parted from you.” 71

[Page 332] This impassioned devotionalism gradually affected the whole religious outlook of the Tamil country. The great Śaṅkara himself, though he maintained the rigid Upanisadic doctrine of salvation by knowledge, wasthe reputed author of some fine devotional poems in Sanskrit. It was only tobe expected that the new forms of worship should receive formal shape, andbe harmonized with the Upanisads. This was done in different forms by aseries of Dravidian theologians who succeeded Śaṅkara.

Chief of these was Ramanuja, a brāhman who taught in the great templeof Śrīrangam. He is said to have lived from 1017 to 1137, but the first dateis in all probability several decades too early. Like Śaṅkara he taught inmany parts of India, and claimed to base his doctrines on earlier sources,writing lengthy commentaries on the Brahma Sūtras, the Bhagavad Gītāand the Upanisads. Ramanuja’s system was founded on that of thePāñcarātras, but his emphasis was rather different. He admitted theusefulness of ritual observances, but only in qualified measure, and he alsoadmitted Śaṅkara’s doctrine of salvation by knowledge, but declared thatthose so saved would find a state of bliss inferior to the highest. The bestmeans of salvation was devotion, and the best yoga was bhakti-yoga, suchintense devotion to Visnu that the worshipper realized that he was but afragment of God, and wholly dependent on him. Another means ofsalvation was prapatti, the abandonment of self, putting one’s soulcompletely in the hands of God, trusting in his will, and waiting confidentlyfor his grace.

Ramanuja’s God was a personal being, full of grace and love for hiscreation. He could even override the power of karma to draw repentantsinners to him. Unlike the impersonal World Soul of gankara, which madethe illusory universe in a sort of sport ( lila), Ramanuja’s God needed man,as man needed God. By forcing the sense Ramanuja interpreted the wordsof Kṛsna, “the wise man I deem my very self” 72 to imply that just as mancannot live without God, so God cannot live without man. The individualsoul, made by God out of his own essence, returned to its maker and livedforever in full communion with him, but was always distinct. It shared thedivine nature of omniscience and bliss, and evil could not touch it, but itwas always conscious of itself as an I, for it was eternal by virtue of itsbeing a part of godhead, and if it lost self-consciousness it would cease toexist. It was one with God, but yet separate, and for this reason the systemof Rāmānuja was called visistādvaita, or “qualified monism”. Ramanujawas not as brilliant a metaphysician as Śaṅkara, but Indian religion perhapsowes even more to him than to his predecessor. In the centuriesimmediately following his death [Page 333] his ideas spread all over India,and were the starting-point of most of the devotional sects of later times.

Many later theologians developed Ramanuja’s teaching, and in the Tamilcountry two main doctrinal divisions arose, analogous to the Arminians andCalvinists of early Protestantism. The Northern School taught that salvationcould only be obtained “on the analogy of the monkey”; God saved souls asthe monkey carries her young to safety, clinging to her body-some effort onthe part of the believer was needed. The Southern School taught salvation“on the analogy of the cat”; just as a cat picks up her kittens in her teeth, soGod saves whom he wills, with no effort on their part.

A teacher who developed Ramanuja’s doctrines in surprising directions was Madhva, who taught in the 13th century. This Canarese theologian broke completely with the Upanisadic doctrine of the unity of God and the human soul, and taught dualism ( dvaita). He explained away as figurative all the passages of scripture which maintained monism, and declared thatVisnu, individual souls and matter were eternally and completely distinct.Visnu has full power over both souls and matter, and saves the formerentirely by his grace, which is only granted to those who live pure andmoral lives. Evil souls are predestined to eternal damnation, which isconceived as infinite remoteness from God-while souls of mediocre qualitywill transmigrate eternally.

An interesting feature of Madhva’s theology is the important part playedby the wind-god Vayu, the son of Visnu, who is his agent in the world, andhas some of the features of the Holy Ghost of Christian theology.29 Theresemblances of Madhva’s system to Christianity are so striking thatinfluence, perhaps through the Syrian Christians of Malabar, is almostcertain. The sharp distinction between God and the soul, the doctrine ofeternal damnation, and the status of Vayu are obvious points of similarity.

In the legends about Madhva there are stories of miracles which must surelyhave been borrowed from the Gospels: as a boy he successfully disputedwith learned brahmans in a temple; when he undertook asceticism a voicefrom heaven proclaimed his greatness; he fed multitudes with handfuls offood; he walked on water; and he stilled the raging ocean with a glance.

Saivism too developed a theology adapted to the devotional literature ofthe hymnodists. The early literature of the Pāūupatas and other Saivitesects, called Agamas and written in Sanskrit, was supplemented, and thenvirtually superseded, by texts in Tamil repeating much of the oldertheology, but incorporating the devotional faith of the Nāyanārs. A series offourteen such texts, all written by the 14th [Page 334] century, forms thebible of the Śaivasiddhānta, and is among the most influential religiousliterature of South India.

Tamil Saivism teaches the reality of the three categories, God ( Pati, “Lord”), souls ( pasu, literally “animals”) and matter ( pasa, “bond”). Insalvation the soul is united, but not identified, with the deity. Tamil Śaivismthus goes further in the direction of dualism than the qualified monism ofthe Vaisnavite Ramanuja. Its most striking feature is the disappearance ofall the harsh, capricious and amoral attributes of the old Siva. In hischaracter as bestower of karma he is pure justice, and his justice is but anaspect of his love for his creatures. He is ready at their call, and manifestshimself to them in whatever form they worship him.

“His form is love, his qualities, his knowledge are love,
his deeds are love, his hands and feet are love, all his attributes
are love.

Unfathomable godhead assumes all these for the welfare of all
things living.”73
“In his love the Lord punishes
that the sinner may mend his ways
and follow the right.

All his acts flow from his love.

“Goodness, love, grace and gentleness,
courtesy, friendship and modesty,
honesty, penance and chastity,
charity, respect, reverence and truthfulness,
purity and self-control,
wisdom and worship—
all these together are perfect virtue,
and are the word of the loving Lord.”74
Tamil Śaivism perhaps approached nearer to thorough-going
monotheism than any other Hindu sect.

“Whatever god you accept, he is that god.

Other gods die and are born, and suffer and sin.

They cannot reward,
but he will see and reward your worship!”75
“We worship some god-our parents for instance—
but they do not reward us, even when they seem to show us
their grace,
for all these gods are under the command of the Almighty,
and through them he fulfils our prayers.

“If Śiva alone rewards us, loving him is the highest virtue,
and the worship of other gods is of little use.

Dharma is his will; he has no desires
except to do good-so be firm in his worship.” 76
[Page 335] In Kashmīr another school of Saivism arose, known as Trika
or Triad, from the fact that the sect had three chief scriptures. This school,


unlike the Tamil Saivasiddhanta, was monistic, and shared Sankara’s doctrine of the unreality of the phenomenal world, which, it declared, only existed because the soul failed to recognize its true nature. For the school ofthe Trika salvation came with an act of recognition or suddenenlightenment, rather like the sudden conversion of old-fashionedNonconformity. The greatest name in Kashmir Saivism is that of AbhinavaGupta (10th century), a brilliant theorist both in theology and poetics.

A third important Śaivite sect was that of the Lingayats or Viraśaivas,founded by Basava, a minister of King Bijjala Kalacuri who usurped thethrone of the Calukyas of Kalyani in A.D. 1156. This sect is noteworthyrather for its cult and social doctrines than for its theology, which is a“qualified monism” with few striking features. Basava opposed imageworship; in his sect the only sacred symbol is the linga of Śiva, a smallspecimen of which is constantly carried on the person of the believer.

Basava completely rejected the Vedas and the authority of the brāhmanclass, and ordained a new priesthood— the jangamas. He opposedpilgrimage and sacrifice and instituted complete equality among hisfollowers, even to the equality of women, who were permitted to remarryon the death of their husbands. Among other Āryan practices which Basavacondemned was cremation, and his followers are still usually buried. It ispossible that he was influenced by what he had heard of Islam. TheLingāyats still retain their individuality, though they have nowcompromised with orthodoxy in some respects, and are an important sect inparts of Hyderabad and Mysore. Their sacred literature is mainly inCanarese and Telugu.

## Hindu Rites and Ceremonies
Whereas the basic rite of the Vedic religion was sacrifice ( yajña), that ofHinduism is worship ( pūjā). In general a god is worshipped in the form ofan icon (arcā), which has been sanctified by special rites, after which it isbelieved that the divinity has in some sense taken up his abode in it. Thoughdevotees often ask for boons at the feet of the idol, pūjā is not so much anact of prayer as of homage and entertainment. The god is offered water forwashing the feet, flowers and betel quids, like an honoured guest. In themorning he is ceremonially awakened with the sound of music, the ringingof bells, and the blowing of conches. He is washed, dried and dressed. He ishonoured with flowers, garlands, incense and swinging lamps; he is fed,usually with rice and fruit, of which he eats the subtle part, [Page 336]leaving the gross material food for his worshippers, or to be given to thepoor. In many temples he is taken to his bedroom at night, where he joinshis wife or wives. In the larger shrines he is fanned by attendants andentertained by dancing girls like any ancient Indian king. On festival dayshe tours the city in a splendid car, often pulled by his devotees, followed bylesser gods in their cars, musicians, bearers of yak’s-tail flywhisks ( cauri),parasols and fans, and dancers.

The temple originated as a small wooden hut, enshrining a rough icon orfetish, and by Gupta times India was probably as much a land of temples asshe is at present. The heart of the temple was the central shrine, the home ofthe chief divinity. Usually a “tank” or a flight of steps leading down to ariver adjoined the temple, for ritual ablution, important at all times, had bynow become an essential part of religious observance. The temple mightalso contain a meeting hall, where the Epics, Puranas, and other non-Vedicsacred literature were recited for all who wished to listen, and a rest-housefor pilgrims was also often provided, as well as many other offices andannexes, some of which served the social needs of the people.

Congregational worship of the Christian or Islamic type was unknown inearly Hinduism, though it developed in a few medieval sects. Theworshipper went to the temple either alone or in a family group, made hisofferings, and departed. In the greater temples the acts of worshipperformed by regular officiants might be watched by a large number ofpeople, but they were rather an audience than a congregation.

Though the formal animal sacrifices of the Vedic period graduallydisappeared, a new type of bloody sacrifice, almost certainly adopted fromthe non-Āryan aboriginals, became popular in the Middle Ages. Such ritesrarely if ever took place in Vaisnavite sects, but some Śaivites and manydevotees of Durga adopted the new type of sacrifice. The animals were nolonger killed with complicated ritual, but decapitated before the sacred icon,in such a way that some of the blood fell on it. The ritual slaughter ofanimals was justified by the doctrine that the soul of the victim wentstraight to heaven, but it was not approved by the best minds of the times,and its survival in Bengal and elsewhere is a matter of shame to mostmodern Hindus.

Favourite animals for sacrifice were buffaloes, goats, sheep and cockerels. Human sacrifice was also practised. Theoretically the execution of every criminal was a sort of sacrifice, and his soul was thought to be purged of guilt. The victims of human sacrifice were thus often criminalsprovided by the secular arm, but victims were also obtained by moredubious means. We read of girls being kidnapped to serve as humansacrifices in secret rites, and of a temple of [Page 337] Durga at which adaily human sacrifice was offered. Voluntary human sacrifice, or religioussuicide’ in various forms, became quite common in the Middle Ages,especially in the Deccan, where numerous inscriptions commemorate themany pious souls who, in fulfilment of vows, or to ensure the success oftheir king, leapt from pillars and broke their necks, cut their own throats, ordrowned themselves in a sacred river. The last rite of the sati was, in oneaspect, a human sacrifice.

Another form of religious ceremony was that practised by the sects whichworshipped feminine divinities. These sects are generally known as tantric(from their scriptures, called tantras), saktic (from their worship of the sakti,or personified energy of the god), or “left-hand” (from the fact that thegoddess sits on the left of her lord). Their members believed that the usualHindu rites and ceremonies, though not wholly ineffectual, were onlysuitable for the ordinary worshippers of the goddess; the adepts, who hadundergone long rites of initiation, practised other ceremonies of muchgreater efficiency, similar to those of the Buddhists of the “Vehicle of theThunderbolt” (p. 280f). The tantric rites involved the breaking of all theusual taboos of Hinduism. Small groups of initiates met at night, often in atemple or private house, but also frequently in a burning-ground, among thebones of the dead. The group formed a circle, seated around thecircumference of a large circular magical diagram (yantra, maṇḍdala)drawn on the ground. Though the members of the circle might includebrāhmaṇs and outcastes, there was no class distinction at the ceremony-allwere equal, and no ritual pollution occurred from their contact. Afterregular evening worship, the propitiation of ghosts, and other rites, thegroup would indulge in the five Ms ( panca-makara): madya (alcoholicdrink), māmsa (meat), matsya (fish), mudrā (symbolical hand gestures,known in other branches of Indian religion, and in dance and drama, p.

385), and maithuna (sexual intercourse). The rites concluded with the


worship of the five elements, to which the five Ms mysteriouslycorresponded. Among some tantric groups the last of the five Ms involvedpromiscuous copulation, while the members of others brought their wives tothe circle. With yet other groups those rites which were reprehensible toorthodoxy were performed only symbolically.The remarkable “black mass” of the tantric sects, whether in Buddhismor Hinduism, became very popular in Eastern India in the late medievalperiod. It is still sometimes practised, but quite without publicity, and it isprobable that with the growth of puritanism and rationalism, the number oftantric groups in India is now very small indeed.

## Hindu Ethics
At the bottom of most Hindu writing on ethics and morality lay the concept of the three ends of life (p. 170), and the full recognition that individuals of different classes and ages had different duties and standardsof conduct. The ascetic should set his whole mind on unworldly things, butthe layman was encouraged to blend the claims of religion, profession andmaterial pleasure into a harmonious whole. This aspect of Hindu moralitywe have touched on already in other contexts and need not discuss further.

To the uninitiated Westerner the usual moral attitude of Hinduism,especially before the great changes of modern times, must seem a strangemixture of reason and taboo. The following passage, taken from theMānasollāsa, a text on the duties and amusements of kings attributed to the12th-century Deccan king Somesvara III Calukya, illustrates perfectly thisaspect of Hindu morals.

“A king should avoid (1) untruth and (2) treachery, (3) illicit
inter
course with women, and (4) eating what is forbidden.

“He should shun (5) envy and (6) contact with outcastes, he
should (7)
revere all the gods, and satisfy (8) cows and (9) brahmans,
“(10) reverence his ancestors, and (11) feed his guests, (12)
obey his
preceptors, (13) practise penance, and (14) bathe in sacred
waters.

“He should (15) nourish the poor, and (16) the orphan and
widow,
(17) the afflicted, and (18) his kin, and (19) his servants,
“and (20) protect those who come to him for refuge.

These are the twenty conditions of a successful reign.” 77 This passage shows that great emphasis was placed on such virtues ashospitality, charity and honesty, but piety, in the sense of the performance ofsuch religious acts as worship, pilgrimage, and the feeding of cows andbrahmans, was equally if not more important. The maintenance of taboos oncontact with untouchables and eating forbidden food (not only meat, butfood handled by low-caste persons or left over from a previous meal) wasnot clearly distinguished from honesty and self-control. At all times,however, the more intelligent teachers realized that mere outwardobservance was not as meritorious as inner goodness. Thus in the lawbookof Gautama, after a catalogue of the forty religious rites which the Āryanshould practice, we read:
“There are eight virtues of the soul-compassion for all beings, patience, contentedness, purity, earnest endeavour, good thoughts, freedom from greed, and freedom from envy. Whoever performs the sacred rites without possessing these eight virtues does not come to Brahmā or to his heaven; but if a man has performed only one rite and has all eight good qualities he comes to Brahmā.”78
[Page 339] Many other sources give lists of virtues like this, all tending to encourage an earnest kindliness and tolerance in human relations. The doctrine of non-violence, qualified though it was, had a real effect on Hindu life, going far beyond mere restrictions on the killing of animals. All Hindutexts teach mercy, compassion and friendliness, but positive benevolence,except in the form of almsgiving, is less prominent, though often amonglists of virtues we find “desire for the welfare of all beings”. A positiveethic of love and forgiveness is a feature of much Tamil sacred literature.

We quote from the maxims of the early Tirukkural:
“Men without love think only of self,
but the loving strip themselves to the bone for others.”
“For a kindness done without expecting reward
heaven and earth are hardly sufficient recompense.”
“The joy of the avenger lasts but a day.

The joy of the peacemaker lasts forever.”
“They are great who fast and do penance,
but they who forgive wrongs are even greater.”
“This, they say, is the highest wisdom—
to return no harm to them that harm you.” 79
This exalted ethical tone is to be found in much Tamil literature,
notably in the Nāladiyār, a collection of moral verses of somewhat
later date than the Tirukkural, and in the devotional hymns which we
have quoted elsewhere. But it is not only in Tamil literature that we
find the call to love and kindness.

“Visnu is most pleased with him who does good to others,
who never utters abuse, calumny or untruth,
who never covets another’s wife or wealth,
and who bears ill will to none,
who neither beats nor slays any living thing,
who is ever diligent in the service of the gods
and of brāhmans and his teachers,
who always desires the welfare of all creatures,
as of his children and of his own soul.”80
If the general ethical outlook of Hinduism favoured tolerance and kindliness, it was not equalitarian, and recognized the needs of a society divided into many sections and classes with varied functions. A man’s relations with his social inferiors should naturally differ from his relations with his betters. His standards of conduct differed [Page 340] according to his own social class. The virtues of the brāhman, such as the recitation of the Veda, were sin to the śūdra, while the śūdra might legitimately do things, such as drinking spirits, which were forbidden to the brāhman.Similarly the child, the student, the householder and the ascetic, had theirown codes and standards. Certain broad principles applied to all sections ofthe community, but beyond these no detailed code of morality wasuniversally binding. Each group had its own rules of conduct, varyingwidely.

It is with this background in view that we must read the most famous ethical text of ancient India, the Bhagavad Gītā. Though this work containsmuch theology, its kernel is ethical, and its teaching is set in the frameworkof an ethical problem. The hero Arjuna awaits in his chariot the beginningof battle. In the ranks of the enemy are his old friends, relatives andteachers, men whom he has known and loved all his life. Though convincedof the justice of his cause his spirits begin to sink, and he feels that hecannot fight against those who are so dear to him. He turns to Kṛsna, who isacting as his charioteer, and asks his advice. Kṛsna first explains that thedeath of the body does not involve the death of the soul and iscomparatively unimportant:
“He who thinks this [soul] is the slayer
and he who thinks this is the slain
do not understand.

It neither slays nor is it slain.

“It is never born and never dies,
nor, once it exists, does it cease to be.

Unborn, eternal, abiding and ancient,
it is not slain when the body is slain…
“As a man puts off his worn out clothes
and puts on other new ones,
so the embodied puts off worn out bodies
and goes to others that are new.

“Weapons do not cleave it,
fire does not burn it,
waters do not wet it,
wind does not dry it.

“It cannot be cleft or burnt,
or wetted or dried.

It is everlasting, it dwells in all things,
firm, unmoving, eternal….

[Page 341] “To be born is certain death,
to the dead, birth is certain.

It is not right that you should sorrow
for what cannot be avoided….

“If you do not fight this just battleyou will fail in your own lawand in your honour,and you will incur sin.” 81Then Kṛsna develops his teaching on the topic of human activity. Theright course is not the inactivity of the meditating sage, for this attempt toput works on one side is impossible and futile. God him self is continuallyactive, and man also should act; but, as far as possible, he should actwithout attachment, without personal desires or ambition. He must fulfil hisfunction in the society of which he is a member, doing all things for theglory of God.

“There is nothing in the three worlds which I need,
nothing I do not own,
nothing which I must get—
and yet I labour forever.

“If I did not always work unwearying …
men would follow my ways.

The worlds would perish if I did not work—
I should bring back chaos, and all beings would suffer.

“So, as the unwise work with attachment,
the wise should work without attachment,
O son of Bharata,
and seek to establish order in the world….

“Cast all your acts upon me,
with your mind on the Highest Soul.

Have done with craving and selfhood.

Throw off your terror, and fight!…
“For there is more joy in doing one’s own duty badly
than in doing another man’s duty well.

It is joy to die in doing one’s duty,but doing another man’s duty brings dread.”82The teaching of the Bhagavad Gītā is summed up on the maxim “yourbusiness is with the deed, and not with the result”. In an organized societyeach individual has his special part to play, and in every circumstance thereare actions which are intrinsically right— from the point of view of the poetwho wrote the Gītā they are those [Page 342] laid down by the Sacred Lawof the Aryans and the traditions of class and clan. The right course must bechosen according to the circumstances, without any considerations ofpersonal interest or sentiment. Thus man serves God, and in so far as helives up to this ideal he draws near to God.

The stern ethics of the Gītā are clearly intended as a defence of the old established order against the attacks of reformers and unbelievers. The virtue of the brāhman is wisdom, of the warrior, valour, of the vaiśya,industry, of the śūdra, service; by fulfilling his class function to the best ofhis ability, with devotion to God and without personal ambition, a man willfind salvation, whatever his class. It may be that the author of the Gītāsought merely to convey this message, rather barren and uninspiring when thus condensed. But behind his teaching was the fervour of a great religiouspoet, which transcended the narrow framework of contemporary social andreligious law. Hence the inspiration of the Bhagavad Gītā has been widelyfelt in India from the time of the Guptas to the present day, and it has beencommended by Christians and Muslims, as well as by the Hindus, whosemost influential scripture it is. No one has so ungrudgingly admitted hisdebt to its doctrine of tireless and unselfish service as Mahatma Gāndhī,who so strongly opposed the two features of ancient Indian society whichthe Gītā itself was in part written to defend—militarism and the classsystem.

## (v) NON-INDIAN RELIGIONS
If we are to believe a very old tradition the first Christian converts in India were made by the Disciple Thomas himself, soon after the Crucifixion. The Indian king Gondophernes sent to Syria for a skilful architect to build him a new city, and the envoy returned with St. Thomas, who told the king of a City not made with hands, and converted him and many members of his court. St. Thomas afterwards preached in other partsof India, and died a martyr’s death at the hands of a king called in Christiantradition Misdeos, who cannot be identified. The historicity ofGondophernes, however, is unquestioned (p. 60), and the story in its mainoutline is not impossible, for at the time contact between India and the Westwas close, and an enterprising missionary could easily have travelled fromPalestine to India. Roman Catholics believe that the tomb of St. Thomas isto be found in the cathedral at Mailapur, a suburb of Madras, though theevidence for the Saint’s martyrdom there is not sufficient to satisfy thehistorian.

Several rather unreliable references to other early missions [Page 343]exist in church tradition, but the first certain evidence of Christian activityin India is found in the “Christian Topography” of Cosmas Indicopleustes,an adventurous Alexandrian monk of the 6th century, who left an account ofhis travels. He states that there were churches in Malabar and Ceylon, in thehands of Persian priests, and supervised by a Persian bishop at Kalliana(perhaps the modern Cochin). It is clear that the Indian Christians hadembraced the Nestorian heresy, which was then widespread in Persia. TheNestorians were active missionaries, and their intrepid monks even crossedthe wastes of Central Asia and founded successful churches in China.

Whatever truth there may be in the legend of St. Thomas, it seems that these missionaries, no doubt following in the wake of Persian merchants,were chiefly responsible for establishing the Christian community in SouthIndia. When, at a later date, Islam stamped out both Zoroastrianism andChristianity in Persia, the Indian Christians turned for guidance to thepatriarch of Antioch, and has maintained contact with Syria to this day.

When European travellers again visited India they noticed the Christianchurches of the South. Marco Polo, at the end of the 13th century, saw thetomb of St. Thomas, and remarked on its popularity as a place ofpilgrimage. But the Syrian church was corrupt. There is no evidence thatIndian Christians ever accepted the doctrine of transmigration, but manyHindu customs had been adopted, and the Malabar Christians, like theBuddhists and Jainas before them, were in the process of becoming a ratherheterodox Hindu sect. Jesuit missionaries of the 16th and 17th centuriessucceeded in preventing further decadence. One section of the Syrianchurch in India accepted the authority of Rome, while the other, whichremained true to Antioch, reformed and purified itself.

It is in this connexion that we find the first record of an Englishmanvisiting India. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that in A.D. 884 KingAlfred, to fulfil a vow, sent an envoy to India with rich gifts for the tomb ofSt. Thomas. Florence of Worcester, writing some 200 years later, adds thatthe name of the envoy was Swithelm, and that he returned safely. Williamof Malmesbury, on the other hand, gives his name as Bishop Sigelinus, and states that he brought back a rich present of jewels and spices from the localIndian king, who, if the story is true, must have been the Cōla King Āditya Ior one of his chiefs. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is generally reliable, and itis reasonable to believe that Alfred sent the envoy, but “India” for 9thcentury Europe was a very loose term, embracing many vaguely knownparts of Asia and Africa, and we cannot be sure that the envoy actuallyvisited the tomb of St. Thomas at Mailapur, or even that it [Page 344] wasin existence at the time. The discrepancy in the names given to the envoy bythe two later chroniclers shows that the tradition was not vividlyremembered, and adds to our suspicion.

On the other hand we know that Christian pilgrims undertook verydifficult journeys in order to visit holy places. At the time Islam was notviolently anti-Christian, and the pilgrim might have found his way acrossEgypt without difficulty, and thence in an Arab merchant vessel to SouthIndia. It is pleasant to picture the brave English cleric, whatever his name,telling the Cōla king through Arab and Tamil interpreters of King Alfred’sbattles with the Danes, and King Alfred, several years later, listening to theenvoy’s account of the wonders of India and sampling the rare spices of theTamil land. Whatever our doubts, we cannot but hope that the story ofBishop Sigelinus is a true one.

As well as Christians small communities of Jews settled in Malabar. Theearliest certain reference to this community is a 10thcentury charter bywhich the king of the Ceras, Bhaskara Ravivarman, gave lands andprivileges to a Jew named Joseph Rabbān; but the tradition of the Jews ofMalabar tells of a large settlement at Cochin in the 1st century A.D. In anycase a small Jewish community has existed in India for well over amillennium. One branch has mixed closely with the local Malayālīinhabitants and its members now have typical Indian complexions andfeatures; the other branch retains its racial purity, and is still evidentlySemitic.

Another non-Indian religious community was that of the Zoroastrians,now generally known as Pārsīs. Under Achæmenid and Sasanian emperorsZoroastrianism was certainly practised in parts of N.-W. India, and hadsome influence on Hinduism and Buddhism, but no very clear traces of aZoroastrian community have survived there. Though Zoroastrian merchantsfrom Persia may have settled on the west coast of India very early, we haveno record of them until after the Arab conquest of Persia, when Zoroastrianrefugees came to India in appreciable numbers. According to the Pārsīs’own traditions one band of refugees settled first at Diu in Kathiawar, andthen at Thana, near Bombay, in the early 8th century.

Yet another community was that of the Muslims. Arabs visited India longbefore the days of Muhammad, and there is evidence of small Muslimcommunities in many of the coastal towns of the Peninsula from the 8thcentury onwards. The Mappila (Moplah) community of Malabar isundoubtedly descended from settlers and converts of long before the daysof Muslim invasion of India. There is, however, no clear evidence of anyinfluence of Islam on Hinduism until after the Muslim conquest.

[Page 345] Thus India, though always loyal to her indigenous cults, gave a welcome to those of the West. If we except the uncertain tradition of St.Thomas’ martyrdom there is no good evidence of the persecution of any of these non-Indian sects. Their members quietly pursued their own cults,small but significant elements in the religious life of the coastal cities, whilethe great body of Hindus were scarcely aware of the alien faiths, and in noway antagonistic to them. This capacity for toleration contributed to thecharacteristic resiliency of Hinduism, and helped to assure its survival.

8Throughout this section and generally in this book we employ Sanskrit forms of Buddhist names and terms, for the sake of consistency. The reader who goes on to more detailed study may meet them in their Pali forms, as used by the Sthaviravada Buddhists.

9We cannot, of course, rely on the verbatim accuracy of the account of the Buddha’s death, and this passage, which occurs in the Pali version,33 seems to be an interpolation directed against Mahayana schools which claimed to possess secret teachings of the Buddha.

10Most modern Buddhists claim that the last meal was of truffles, and the Pali phrase sūkara-maddava, “sweetness of pigs”, is certainly ambiguous.34But early commentators took it to mean a choice cut of pork.” 3511The Pāli form.

23Govinda is probably a Prakrit word, absorbed by Sanskrit in its original form. The correct Sanskrit equivalent would thus be Gopendra. On the orthodox assumption that the word is pure Sanskrit its translation would be “Cow-finder”.

25Brahmā is said to be now in his fifty-first year.

26Though the terms “day “and “year of Brahma” are commonly used, the god whose life contains the universe is, as we have seen, thought of by Vaiṣṅnsavites as Visnu and by Śaivites as Śiva, and Brahmā is a mere demiurge, the god in his creative aspect.

VIII
THE ARTS: ARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE,
PAINTING, MUSIC AND THE DANCE


## THE SPIRIT OF INDIAN ART
[Page 346]
NEARLY all the artistic remains of ancient India are of a religious nature, or were at least made for religious purposes. Secular art certainly existed, for literature shows that kings dwelt in sumptuous palaces, decorated withlovely wall-paintings and sculpture, though all these have vanished. Muchhas been said and written about Indian art since, some forty years ago,European taste began to doubt the established canons of the 19th centuryand looked to Asia and Africa for fresh æsthetic experience. Since thenmost authorities on the subject, Indian and European alike, have stressed thereligious and mystical aspect of Indian art. While admitting the realism andearthiness of the earliest sculpture, most critics have read the truths ofVedanta or Buddhism into the artistic remains of our period, and haveinterpreted them as expressions of deep religious experience, sermons instone on the oneness of all things in the Universal Spirit.1One student at least disagrees with this interpretation. There are indeed afew remains which seem imbued with an intensity of religious feeling rarein the art of the world, but it is the full and active life of the times which ischiefly reflected in the art of ancient India, at first directly, as at Bhārhut,Sānchī and Amarāvatī, then with a gentle idealism, as at Ajanta, and finallyin the multitude of figures, divine and human, carved on the many templesof the Middle Ages. In all these phases there is a horror vacui and anintense vitality which remind us rather of this world than the next, andsuggest to us the warm bustle of the Indian city and the turbulent pullulationof the Indian forest.

Gothic architecture and sculpture are vertical. Spire and arch pointupward, and as the style develops the spire becomes taller and the archmore pointed. The Christs, saints and angels of the Middle Ages in Europeare often disproportionately tall, and their tallness is accentuated by longgarments reaching to the ankles. Their poses are generally restful, and theyrarely smile. Medieval European art was truly religious; its conventionsseem to have been [Page 347] deliberately designed to lead theworshipper’s thoughts away from the world of flesh to the things of thespirit. Much of it was the work of pious monks, or of men with deepreligious vocations.

The tendency of Indian art is diametrically opposite to that of medievalEurope. The temple towers, though tall, are solidly based on earth. Theideal type is not abnormally tall, but rather short and stocky. Gods anddemigods alike are young and handsome; their bodies are rounded and well-nourished, often by European standards rather effeminate. Occasionallythey are depicted as grim or wrathful, but generally they smile, and sorrowis rarely portrayed. With the exception of the type of the dancing Śiva thesacred icon is always firmly grounded, either seated or with both feet flat onthe ground. We need hardly mention that all Indian temple sculpture, Hindu,Buddhist and Jaina alike, made full use of the female form as a decorativemotif, always scantily dressed, and nearly always in accordance with Indianstandards of beauty.Asceticism and self-denial in various forms are praised in much Indianreligious literature, but the ascetics who appear in sculpture are llusuay wellfed and cheerful. As an example we may cite the colossal rock-cut medievalimage of the Jaina saint Gommateśvara (pl. LIX) at Śravana Belgolā inMysore. He stands bolt upright in the posture of meditation known askĀyotsarga, with feet firm on the earth, and arms held downwards but nottouching the body, and he smiles faintly. The artist must have tried toexpress the soul almost set free from the trammels of matter, and about toleave for its final resting place of everlasting bliss at the top of the universe.Whatever the intentions of the artist, however, Gommatesvara is still anordinary young man of his time, full of calm vitality. The saint is said tohave stood for so long in meditation that creepers twined round hismotionless legs, and these are shown in the sculpture; but, though intendedto portray his sanctity, they do but emphasize that he is a creature of theearth whom the earth pulls back.

Ancient India’s religious art differs strikingly from her religiousliterature. The latter is the work of men with vocations, brahmans, monksand ascetics. The former came chiefly from the hands of secular craftsmen,who, though they worked according to priestly instructions and increasinglyrigid iconographical rules, loved the world they knew with an intensitywhich is usually to be seen behind the religious forms in which theyexpressed themselves. In our opinion the usual inspiration of Indian art isnot so much a ceaseless quest for the Absolute as a delight in the world asthe artist found it, a sensual vitality, and a feeling of growth and movementas regular and organic as the growth of living things upon earth.



## THE EARLIEST ARCHITECTURE
[Page 348] Of the visual arts of ancient and medieval India much architecture and sculpture and a little painting have survived. As most of the existing sculpture was intended to be ancillary to architecture we deal with the latter first.k

The utilitarian brick buildings of the Harappā Culture, strong and competent though they were, had apparently little æsthetic merit, and will not be mentioned here. With the exception of the walls of Rajagrha (p. 198),which also have no artistic value, we have no significant architecturalremains between the Harappā period and that of the Mauryas. This was dueto the fact that few if any buildings were made of stone during this time.Megasthenes mentions that the palace of Candragupta Maurya, thoughvery large and luxurious, was built of carved and gilded wood, and theearliest stone buildings to have survived were evidently modelled onwooden originals. We must not assume, from the complete lack of materialremains, that Indian building in the Mauryan period, or even before, wasmean or primitive. The Mauryan monolithic columns prove that thecraftsmen of those days had a thorough mastery of working in stone, and ifthe great cities of Mauryan times were built of wood we must attribute thischiefly to the comparative scarceness of stone in the Gangetic Plain and theabundance of timber where it is now scarce. There is no evidence of acultural advance in the Middle Ages, when building in stone becamecommon, but rather of a decline. The adoption of stone as a buildingmedium was due partly to foreign contacts, but also to the gradualdisappearance of timber forests from the more populous and civilizedregions of India.

The wonderful Mauryan columns with their finely carved capitals fall rather under the head of sculpture than of architecture, for most of thosewhich survive had no architectural purpose. Fragments of similar columns,found at Patna, supported the roof of a palace, which has been reasonablyidentified as that of Aśoka. The remains of the Patna pillared hall are sofragmentary that the plan of the building cannot be accuratelyreconstructed, but it was evidently a large one. At this time, however, stonebuildings must still have been very rare. All the Mauryan pillars and otherproducts of Mauryan stonemasons come from the same quarry, at Chunar,not far from Banāras, and all bear the stamp of the same school. They arethe work of craftsmen who had learnt much from Persia, and perhaps a littlefrom Greece, but had given their output distinctive Indian characteristics.

Their workshops were probably maintained by the Mauryan kings, and [Page 349] vanished with the dynasty. Working in stone had then to make a new beginning in India.

## THE STŪPA
The stupa began as an earthen burial mound, which was revered by the local population, and we have seen that the cult of stūpas was taken up byBuddhism, and that Aśoka raised stūpas in the Buddha’s honour all overIndia (p. 263). Only one stūpa, in Nepal, survives in the form in which thegreat emperor left it, but excavations of existing stūpas have shown thecharacter of the earlier ones. They were large hemispherical domes,containing a central chamber, in which the relics of the Buddha were placedin a small casket, often beautifully carved in crystal. The core of the stūpawas of unburnt brick, and the outer face of burnt brick, covered with a thicklayer of plaster. The stūpa was crowned by an umbrella of wood or stone,and was surrounded by a wooden fence enclosing a path for the ceremonialclockwise circumambulation ( pradaksind), which was the chief form ofreverence paid to the relics within it. 1In the period between the Mauryas and the Guptas much wealth andenergy were spent on Buddhist architecture, and the older stilpas weregreatly enlarged and beautified. Of these three are specially noteworthy-those at Bhārhut in Madhya Bharat, Sānchī in the old Bhopal state, andAmarāvatī in the lower Kīstna Valley. The Bhārhut stupa, perhaps in itspresent form dating from the middle of the 2nd century B.C., is importantchiefly for its sculpture, and the stūpa itself has now vanished. That atSānchī, on the other hand, is one of the most striking architectural remainsof ancient India (pl. XIb).In the 2nd century B.C. the old Sānchī stūpa was enlarged to twice itsoriginal size, becoming a hemisphere of about 120 feet in diameter. It wasthen faced with well-cut masonry laid in regular courses, and, besides thelower path on ground level, an upper terraced path some 16 feet from theground was added. The old wooden railings were replaced by stone ones 9feet high, tenoned and mortised in imitation of carpentry. Finally, towardsthe end of the 1st century B.C., four glorious gateways ( torana) were addedat the four cardinal points. Lesser stūpas and monastic buildings surroundedthe great stūpa (fig. xviii).


The Sānchī gateways (pl. XXVII) are perhaps more noteworthy [Page 350] for their carved ornamentation than their architecture. Each consists of two square columns, above which are three curved architraves supported by animals or dwarfs, the whole reaching some 34 feet above ground-level.

The construction of these gateways, from the technical point of view, isprimitive, and it has been suggested that their design is based on the log orbamboo portcullis of the ancient Indian village.3 The finish, on the otherhand, is remarkably good, and the carvings are among the most fresh andvigorous products of the Indian sculptor (pl. XXVIII).In respect of size few Indian stūpas greatly exceeded that of Sanchl, butin Ceylon the stūpa reached tremendous proportions. The AbhayagiriDagaba at Anuradhapura, the capital of the early kings of Ceylon, was 327feet in diameter, and larger than some of the pyramids of Egypt. It reachedits present size, after a succession of enlargements, in the 2nd century A.D.Fig. xviii. stūpas and Monasteries at Sānchī. (Reproduced from Percy Brown’s “IndianArchitecture (Buddhist and Hindu)”, published by D. B. Taraporevala Sons & Co. Ltd., Bombay)In India stūpa architecture became more and more ornate. The stūpa ofAmarāvatī (fig. xix), which in its final form was completed c. 200 A.D., waslarger than that of Sānchī, and its two promenades were adorned withcarved panels (some of which can be seen in the British Museum) tellingthe story of the life of the Buddha. Meanwhile in Northern India stūpasgrew taller in proportion to their bases. They were often set on square

platforms, which in Burma and Indonesia were developed into stepped pyramids, the largest of which [Page 351] is the enormous stūpa of Borobodūr, in Java, built in the 8th century A.D. Pinnacles became higher, and developed towards the spiring forms of the present-day temples of Burma and Siam.  Of later Indian stūpas the two most famous are those of Sarnath andNālandā. The tall stūpa of Sarnath (pl. XIIa), near Banāras, the scene of theBuddha’s first sermon, of which now little more than the inner coreremains, was once a most imposing structure of beautifully patternedbrickwork with a high cylindrical upper dome rising from a lowerhemispherical one, and large images of the Buddha set in gable ends at thecardinal points. In its final form it dates from the Gupta period. The stūpa atNālandā (pl. XIIb), seven times successively enlarged, in its present ruinedstate gives the impression of a brick pyramid with steps leading up to itsterraces. It was originally a tall stūpa raised on a high base, with a smallerstūpa at each corner, but the monument underwent so many alterations inGupta and Pāla times that it is now difficult for the untrained eye torecognize its original form at any one stage of its development.Fig. xix.-The Stiipa of Amaravatl. (Reproduced from Percy Brown’s “Indian Achitecture(Buddhist and Hindu)”, published by D. B. Taraporevala Sons & Co. Ltd., Bombay)Around the great stūpas were lesser ones, often containing the ashes ofmonks famous for their piety and learning, and a whole complex ofbuildings-monasteries, shrine-rooms, preaching halls and resthouses forpilgrims (fig. xviii). At the greater Buddhist sites such as Nālandā thegroups of monastic buildings were often [Page 352] surrounded by fortress-like walls. In their present partial dilapidation these heavy domessometimes seem a little forbidding. Originally the limewashed or plasteredstūpa shone brilliantly white in the tropical sunlight, its pinnacle, nowgenerally broken, rising like a golden spear from the ceremonial stoneumbrella on top of the dome. Then it must have given a differentimpression. The great Ruvanvili Dāaiba at Anuradhapura in Ceylon, whichin recent years has been restored and is once more used in Buddhistworship, rising white in the distance out of the plain, shows the stūpa at itsbest, as a worthy emblem of a great religion.

## CAVE TEMPLES
Of the centuries before the Gupta period the chief architectural remains, other than stūpas and their surrounding gateways and railings, are artificialcaves, excavated for religious purposes. Early specimens show a slavishimitation of carpentry which proves conclusively that the art of building instone was still in its infancy. Thus two of the caves of Barabar Hill, nearGayā, dedicated by Aśoka to Ājīvika monks, are in the form of a plainrectangular outer hall, at one end of which is an inner chamber with acurved wall and overhanging eaves. The caves were evidently substitutedfor a standardized religious meeting place consisting of a round thatchedhut standing in a courtyard, and their designer could not transcend thepattern to which he had been used. Similar dependence on wooden modelsis evident in many other features of design until the Gupta period.

The caves of the Barabar and Nāgārjunī Hills are quite unadorned, with the exception of one at Nāgārjunī, near Barabar, which has a comparatively simple carved entrance, added during or soon after the Mauryan period. Theinner walls of all the caves are finely polished, no doubt by workmen of theschool which was responsible for the polish of the Aśokan columns.Later cave temples and monasteries are to be found in many parts ofIndia, but it was in the Western Deccan, under the Satavahana Empire andits successors, that the largest and most famous artificial caves wereexcavated. The oldest Deccan cave, at Bhaja, near Poona, consists of a deepapsidal hall, cut in solid rock, with a row of plain octagonal pillars near thewalls, which support curved ribs carved to represent the barrel vaulting of awooden building. At the further end of the hall is a small stūpa, also cutfrom solid rock, and the outside of the cave has a facade, carved like agable, with smaller ornamental gables on either side. Beside this cave,which was a meeting hall for Buddhist monks and lay worshippers, is asecond cave [Page 353] consisting of a broad cutting into the rock, leadingto five cells, which were the dwellings of the monks.

From these beginnings the cave temples developed in size and splendour.The finest single example is the great caitya hall at Karli (pl. XIII),probably made about the beginning of the Christian era. This is cut 124 feetdeep into the rock, and is of the same general pattern as that at Bhājā andmany other caves of the Western Deccan, but much developed in size andsplendour. The columns are no longer plain and austere, but, by a processwhich can be traced through earlier stages, they have become heavy andornate. Each is set on a square stepped plinth, and rises from a bulbousbase, which is carved to represent a large pot with base and rim; this is
another survival of wooden construction, for the octagonal wooden pillarsof earlier days were bedded in large earthenware pots [Page 354] to protectthem from ants and other insects. Each pillar carries a complicated group ofhorses and elephants with riders to support the roof, which is carved inimitation of the timber rafters of barrel vaulting. The caitya or shrine at theend of the hall is much enlarged in comparison with those of other caves.

The simple facades of the earlier caves were developed into elaborately carved verandas, usually with a large window, the full size of the gable-end, which let light into the hall (pl. XIVa). The Karli cave has three fine entrances, and a frieze of relief sculpture on the lower levels, with small carved gable-ends above.

With the caitya halls the associated rock-cut monasteries or sanhārāmasalso developed in size and splendour. As a cave monastery became toosmall for its inhabitants a new cave was cut nearby and so the complex ofcaves grew over the centuries. The most famous of these cave groups is thatof Ajanta, in the north-west corner of Hyderābād. Here no less than twenty-seven caves, some going 100 feet deep into the rock, were excavated in thehorseshoe curve of a hillside, not far from the great trade route leading fromthe North to the Deccan (pl. XIV). The earliest caves date from the 2ndcentury B.C., while others are as late as the 7th century A.D. The splendidsculpture and lovely paintings with which they are adorned make them oneof the most glorious monuments of India’s past (p. 377f).

Perhaps even more impressive are the later cave temples of Ellora, near Aurangabad, some thirty miles from Ajanta. Here are no less than thirty-four caves, constructed from the 5th to the 8th centuries A.D., most of themHindu but some Buddhist and Jaina. The crowning achievement of Ellora isthe great Kailasanatha Temple, excavated on the instructions of theRāstrakūta emperor Kīstna I (c. A.D. 756–773). With this the concept of thecave temple was transcended, for the king was not satisfied with a merehollow in the rock. The entire rock face was cut away and a splendid templecarved like a statue from the hillside, complete with shrineroom, hall,gateway, votive pillars, lesser shrines and cloisters, the whole adorned withdivine figures and scenes large and small of a grace and strength rarely seenagain in Indian art (pl. XV). The ground plan of Kailasanatha is of about thesame size as the Parthenon, and it is half as high again. The labournecessary to construct it, however, was less than that which would berequired to build a comparable temple of masonry, for transport created noproblem, and the process of construction, beginning at the top of the cliffand working down to the base, avoided the need of scaffolding. But noconsiderations of this kind can disparage the glory of [Page 355]Kailasanatha, “the most stupendous single work of art executed in India “.4Kailasanatha is not the earliest temple hewn from solid rock. Others areto be found at Mamallapuram, on the sea-coast some thirty miles south ofMadras, where seventeen temples, none very large in size, were carvedfrom outcropping hillocks of granite under the patronage of 7th centuryPallava kings. The most famous of these, the “Seven Pagodas”, still showthe influence of wood construction, and are of a distinctive style, possiblylooking back to Dravidian prototypes.

The latest cave-temples of importance are those of Elephanta, a beautiful
little island off Bombay. These, in the same style as those of Ellora, arefamous for their sculpture, especially for the great Trimūrti figure of Śiva(p. 372). After these no important caves were excavated. Indians had longknown the art of building in stone. The Kailasanatha Temple, carved inexact imitation of masonry, showed the dissatisfaction with the older caveform. The great period of medieval temple building had begun.

## TEMPLES
The earliest free-standing religious building of which traces remain is a small round hall, probably originally containing a Buddhist stūpa, at Bairat near Jaipur; this dates from the 3rd century B.C., and was made of brick and wood; little but the foundations now exist, and the form had no future.

The next landmark in temple architecture is the temple generally known,
from the modern name of the site, as that of Jandiāl, excavated from one of
the mounds which covered the city of Taksasila. This, one of the importantbuildings of the Greek city, contained a square inner sanctuary, a meetinghall and a courtyard, and its outer and inner entrances were each flanked bytwo large pillars of orthodox Ionian pattern. The Jandial temple wasprobably Zoroastrian, and had no direct successors, but the influence ofWestern architecture is clearly to be seen in Kashmir, where columns ofHellenic type were used throughout the medieval period, in conjunctionwith distinctive pyramidal roofs and arches surmounted by pointed gables,which give the Kashmīr style an almost Gothic appearance. Most famous ofKashmīr’s early temples is the Temple of the Sun at Martand, dating fromthe 8th century. There are no remains of free-standing Hindu templeserected before the Gupta period, though by this time they must long havebeen built in wood, clay and brick. From the Gupta period, however, severalexamples survive, chiefly in Western [Page 356] India, all showing thesame general pattern. Pillars were usually ornate, with heavy bell-shapedcapitals surmounted by animal motifs, and the entrances were often carvedwith mythological scenes and figures. All the Gupta temples were small,and most had flat roofs. Their masonry was held together without mortar,and was far larger and thicker than was necessary for the comparativelysmall buildings. Evidently their builders had not yet fully mastered theirtechnique, and were still thinking in terms of the cave. The finest Guptatemple, that of Deogarh near Jhānsī, probably of the 6th century, marks agreat advance. Here iron dowels were used to hold the masonry together,and a small tower rose above the sanctum. The portal veranda wascontinued all round the building, making a covered walk.The standard type of the Hindu temple, which has persisted from the 6thcentury to the present day, was not fundamentally different from that of theancient Greeks. The heart of the temple was a small dark shrine-room( garbhagrha), containing the chief icon. This opened on a hall forworshippers ( mandapa), originally a separate building, but usually joined tothe shrine-room by a vestibule ( antarāla). The hall was approached by aporch ( ardhamandapa). The shrine-room was generally surmounted by atower, while lesser towers rose from other parts of the building. The wholewas set in a rectangular courtyard, which might contain lesser shrines, andwas often placed on a raised platform.

The medieval period in India was, like the Middle Ages in Europe, an
age of faith. With better techniques of stone construction new temples
sprang up everywhere to replace earlier wooden buildings, and kings andchiefs vied with one another in their foundation. Strict canons of design inboth architecture and sculpture were laid down in textbooks ( silpasastra),some of which survive.5 The technique of architecture was not faradvanced, despite the great achievements of the period. Though archesoccur in the cave temples and in Kashmir, the art of making a true arch,dome or vault, seems to have been ignored, although corbellingthe buildingup of an arch or dome by overlapping courses of brick or masonry-waswidely practised, and produced work of great beauty. Mortar was known,but rarely used, for the style of archless and domeless architectureemployed made it virtually unnecessary.

The temple was ornately decorated, often even to the dark shrineroomslighted only by flickering oil-lamps. Despite this ornateness theapprenticeship of his tradition in rock architecture gave the architect astrong sense of mass. Heavy cornices, strong pillars, [Page 357] wide inproportion to their height, and the broad base of the śikhara, or tower, giveto Indian temple architecture a feeling of strength and solidity, only in partcounteracted by the delicately ornate friezes, and the many figures in highor low relief which often fill the whole surface of the temple wall.Considering the size of the land, Indian temple architecture is remarkablyuniform, but authorities distinguish two chief styles and numerous schools.The Northern or Indo Āryan style prefers a tower with rounded top andcurvilinear outline, while the tower of the Southern or Dravidian style isusually in the shape of a rectangular truncated pyramid. The stages ofstylistic development are clearer in the South than in the North, where manyancient temples were destroyed by the Muslim invaders. We thereforeconsider the styles of the Peninsula first.Temple building gained much from the patronage of the Pallava andCalukya kings in the 6th-8th centuries. Important early temples of theformer dynasty are to be found at Mamallapuram, already referred to (p.355), and Kāñcī, while the Calukyas left temple remains at their capitalBadami, and the nearby site of Aihole, both in Hyderābād. Both styles showthe gradual emancipation of the architect from the techniques of carpentryand cave architecture. The apogee of the Pallava style was reached in theShore Temple at Mamallapuram (pl. XVIa) and the Kailasanatha Temple ofKāñcī, built early in the 8th century. The latter has a pyramidal towerformed of two courses of small barrel vaults, surmounted by a solid cupolasuggesting a Buddhist stūpa.

The style of the Pallavas was developed further under the C61a dynasty(10th-12th centuries), the finest products of which are the great temple ofŚiva at Tanjore, built by Rajaraja the Great (985–1014), and the temple builtby his successor, Rajendra I, at his new capital of Gangaikondacolapuram,near Kumbakonam. The former was probably the largest temple built inIndia up to that time; the comparatively modest tower of the Pallava stylewas replaced by a great pyramid, rising from a tall upright base andcrowned with a domed finial, the whole being nearly 200 feet high. This setthe style of the Dravidian sikhara, which has continued with some variationdown to the present day. Both these temples contain elaborate pillared hallsand beautiful decoration.

In the next phase of Dravidian architecture the emphasis shifted from the
tower above the chief shrine to the entrance gateway of the surrounding
wall. Though there are a few records of the desecration of temples by
hostile sectarians or invaders, it is difficult to find a practical reason for thegrowing custom of surrounding South Indian [Page 358] temples withstrong and high walls, unless this was done in imitation of the palaces ofkings, with which the temples had much in common. From the 12th centuryonwards it became usual to fortify the temple, often with three squareconcentric walls, with gates on the four sides. The gates were surmountedby watch-towers or gatehouses, and these developed into soaring towers( gopuram), generally much taller than the modest sikhara over the centralshrine. The entrance tower was usually in the form of an oblong pyramid,with its broadest side parallel to the wall (pl. XIXa). The new style is oftencalled Pāndyan, from the name of the dynasty which supplanted the Cōlasin the Tamil country, and the kings of which were responsible for buildingwalls and gateway towers round many existing shrines. The styleintroduced more elaborate ornamentation, and the use of animal forms inpilasters and columns, including the rampant horses and leogryphs whichgive a distinctive character to late Dravidian architecture.

The culmination of the Pandyan style lies in the mighty temple
complexes of Madurai, Śrīranam, and elsewhere, which are strictly outside
our period, belonging in their present form to the 17th century. The greattemple of Madurai is the most famous and beautiful of these (pl. XIXb), butthe largest is the Vaisnavite temple of Srirangam (fig. xv, p. 201), which iscontained in an outer wall measuring 2,475 by 2,880 feet, and has six innerwalls, all with gopurams, surrounding a shrine of comparatively modestproportions These later towers were covered with sculptured figures.

While these developments were taking place in the Tamil country, other
styles developed in the Deccan, under the Calukyas, Rastrakutas and
Hoysalas. The earliest Calukyan temples closely resemble the Guptan instyle. By the 8th century they had developed individual features, includingthe wide overhanging eaves which became characteristic of the medievaltemples of the Central Deccan. The later Calukyas and Hoysalas (1 th-14thcenturies) developed a more elaborate style. Their temples were no longerbuilt on a rectangular plan, but were polygonal or stellate, raised on a tallsolid platform of the same shape as the building. These temples give astrong feeling of flatness, for platforms and walls alike are covered withrather narrow carved friezes of elephants, horsemen, geese, monsters ( yāli),and scenes of mythology and legend (pl. XVII). The grotesque mask( kīrtimukha) 2 became very common as a decorative [Page 359] feature, andturned columns, often ornately carved, were widely used. The largest andmost famous temples of this style, at Halebid (Dorasamudra, the Hoysalacapital) and Bēlūr, have no towers, and it is thought that they were notcompleted. Some smaller temples of the same period have towers, notablythe charming temple of Somnathpur (pl. XVIb), which has three low dome-like sikharas, their breadth emphasized by parallel mouldings. Its profusionof pillars, and its abhorrence not only of blank spaces but even of planesurfaces and straight lines, tend to give this style an impression ofweddingcake prettiness, despite the solid proportions of its masonry and thebrilliance of its sculptured decoration.

The school which flourished under the Vijayanagara empire, and reached
its apogee in the 16th century, shows both Pandyan and Hoysala features.

The florid carving of the Hoysalas was developed with even greaterexuberance, and new elements appeared in the temple complex. As well asthe main shrine every important temple in South India was provided with ashrine for the amman, the god’s chief wife, which was often nearly as largeas the main shrine itself, and a marriage-hall ( kalyānamandapam), whereinthe icons of god and goddess were ceremonially united on festival days.

Another feature of the Vijayanagara style is the profusion of strong yet
delicate carving which adorns the pillared halls, the many columns of which
are so decorated that they become sculptures in their own right. Prancinghorses, vigorous and energetic, leap from the stone (pl. XVIIIc), withleogryphs and other fantastic monsters. For brilliancy of decorativeimagination the Vijayanagara style of architecture was never surpassed inHindu India. Its finest production is undoubtedly the Vitthala Temple atHampi, the old Vijayanagara.

In the chief cities of Northern India almost all traces of the architecture ofthe Hindu period have vanished. Even in holy Banāras all the great andfamous temples are comparatively recent. One important exception,however, is the Buddhist temple at Gaya (pl. XXa) the main tower of whichis probably as early as the 6th century. This is a large pyramid of brickwork,set on a high plinth; it is adorned with parallel courses of “caitya window”pattern and is surmounted by a lofty pinnacle which was originally a smallstūpa. Similar towers existed in other Buddhist monastic establishments, buthave long since vanished. The Gayā tower suggests rather the Southern thanthe Northern style of śikhara, but other temples of the period either have notowers or have small curvilinear ones which are evidently the prototypes ofthe later Northern śikhara.

Medieval North Indian architecture is best illustrated by three [Page 360]
schools-those of Orissā, Bundelkhand, and Gujarat and South Rajasthan.


There were other local developments, as well as the distinctive style of
Kashmīr which we have already noted, but these three are certainly the
most important, and their products are the best preserved.

The Orissan school flourished from the 10th to the 13th centuries, and its
chief monuments lie in and around the towns of Bhubanesar and Purī. The
finest Orissān temple is the Lingarūja at Bhubanesar (pl. XXb, fig. xxi),
which shows the North Indian sikhara in its final form-a tower which
begins to curve inwards at about one third of its height, with rounded topcrowned by a flat stone disc ( amalaka) and a finial ( kalaśa). The upwardmovement of this graceful curving tower is emphasized by deep verticalinlets, but its solidity and firm basis on earth are very evident. TheLingarāja, like most Orissan temples, is built as a series of four halls-a hallof offerings, a dancing hall, an assembly hall and a sanctuary. 3 Thesanctuary is crowned by the great tower, but the other three elements of thetemple, leading one by one to the shrine, are also roofed with characteristictowers of smaller size, carrying the eye to the main sikhara. The wholetemple enclosure of the Lihgaraja is filled with smaller shrines, built on thepattern of the great one.

PLATE LXX
[Page 361] The Orissan architects were lavish with their exteriordecoration, and their sculptors produced works of great merit, but theinteriors of their temples are unadorned. In the larger temples the corbelledroofs of the halls rested on four large pilasters, but pillars were notgenerally used, and roofs were often partly supported by iron girders, astriking technical innovation.6Among the most important Orissān temples are the Temple of Visnu-Jagannatha at Purl, still one of the most famous shrines of India, and the“Black Pagoda” of Konārak, built in the 13th century. The latter, a templeof Sūrya, the sun-god, was formerly one of the largest and most splendidtemples of India, much larger than those of Bhubanesar (fig. xxii). Thetower, over 200 feet high, has long since fallen, but the great assembly-hallremains. Unlike the other temples of this region that of Konārak had thetwo smaller outer halls completely separate from the main structure, andassembly-hall and tower were built on an imposing platform, round whichwere carved twelve decorated wheels, 10 feet in diameter (pl. XXIa). Theentrance is reached by a broad flight of steps, flanked on either side byprancing horses, the whole representing the chariot in which the sun-godrides across the heavens. The court of the temple was decorated with largefree-standing sculptures of great strength and beauty (pls. LVII-III). Theexceptionally frank eroticism of many [Page 362] of the Konārak sculptures has given the “Black Pagoda” a rather infamous reputation. Maithuna
figures, of couples closely embracing or actually in coitu, are commonenough as decorative features of many Indian temples, but those of Konārakare exceptionally vivid. Many suggestions have been made as to the truesignificance of these figures; it has been suggested that they merely servedthe mundane purpose of advertising the charms of the devadasis, or templeprostitutes, 7 or that they were intended to represent the world of the flesh, incontrast to the bare and austere interior, which symbolized the things of thespirit; probably they were connected, in the minds of their designers, withthe sexual mysticism which played so great a part in medieval Indianreligious thought. 8 No doubt the temple of Konarak was a centre of aflourishing tantric cult. 9

Architecture (Buddhist and Hindu)”, published by D. B. Taraporevala Sons & Co. Ltd., Bombay)
Under the Candella kings of Bundelkhand a great school of architectureflourished in the 10th and 11th centuries, the chief work of which is abeautiful group of temples at Khajurāho, about 100 miles south-east ofJhānsī. These temples are built on a rather different plan from those ofOrissā, and are not very large the finest, a ūaivite temple known asKandariya-Mahādeo, was built about A.D. 1000, and is not more than 100feet high. The standard type of Khajurāho temple contains a shrine-room orsanctuary, an assembly-hall, and an entrance portico. Whereas in theOrissān temple these elements were conceived rather as separate entitiesjoined together by vestibules, the Khajurāho architects treated them as awhole, and though each part has its own roof they are not structurallyseparate. The Khaiuraho śikhara, like those of most Northern temples, iscurvilinear (pi. XXc), but differs fromthetype of Orissā. It is curved for itswhole length, and its upward thrust is accentuated by miniature sikharasemerging from the central tower. The crowning discsoftheseprojectionsbreakthe upward movement, and remind the observer that the divine is tobe found on earth as well as in heaven. The effect of thewhole,despiteitssymmetry,isoneoforganicandnaturalgrowth. The tower, and indeed thewhole temple, seems intimately at one with the earth, suggesting anenormous ant-hill, or a highpeaksurroundedbylessermountains.Thoughexpressed in the most baroque of styles, the Kandariya-Mahadeo is astriking instance of a feature common in much Indian art, a feeling of unitywith nature.

The halls and porticoes of the Khajurāho temples are also crowned withsmaller towers, which rise progressively to lead the eye up to the maintower, and thus intensify the impression of a mountain range. While theOrissān roof is pyramidal in pattern, the Khajurāho builders employedcorbelling to produce the effect of a flattish [Page 363] dome. The mass ofthe buildings is broken by pillared window openings, which relieve themonotony of the ornately carved stone. A further distinctive feature of thestyle was the introduction of small transepts to the assembly hall, giving thewhole a ground-plan not unlike that of a Gothic cathedral.

Like all other schools of architecture, that of Khajurāho made much use
of carving. Here, in contrast to Orissā, the temples were adorned withsculpture both outside and in, and the halls have beautifully carved domicalceilings. The style of Khajurāho sculpture lacks the solidity and vigour ofthe best of Orissā, but the wonderful friezes of statuary contain figures of agraceful vitality, warmer and more immediately attractive than those of theOrissān temples (pls. XLVI-VIII).

In Rajasthan and Gujarat are many medieval temples, some of much architectural merit. Here we can only mention the greatest of these Western schools, thatwhichroseunderthepatronage of the Caulukya or Solānkikings of Gujarat, and flourished from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Thiskingdom was wealthy from theseabornetradewiththeArabsandPersians,and much of the treasure of kings, ministers and merchants alike wasexpended on beautiful Jaina and Hindu temples.The most famous buildings of this school are the lovely Jaina shrines ofMount Ābū the style of which is not very different fundamentally from thatof Khajurāho. The temples were built on high platforms and usuallyconsisted of a shrine and hall only, without an entrance portico. The sikharaover the shrine, like those of Khajuraho, was adorned with a large numberof miniature towers, and the ceilings were in the form of corbelled domes.

Perhaps through the influence of Muslim architectural styles, these ceilings were carved so as to give the impression of a true dome, the steps of thecorbelling being skilfully concealed by the sculptor, and the flatcrossbeams, supported on pillars, often being adorned with large bracketsmeeting at the centre, which gave an arch-like effect, though the true archwas never employed. The most outstanding feature of this style was itsminute and lovely decorativeness (pls. XXIc, XXII). The shrines of MountĀbū, made of cool white marble, are covered with the most delicate andornate carving, especially in the interiors: it is, however, rather flaccid andrepetitive. In comparison with Bhubanesar, Konārak and Khajurāho the richdecoration of Mount Ābū has a flavour of cold lifelessness.

Remains of pre-Muslim secular buildings are few. In the Middle Ageskings and chiefs certainly built stone palaces, but of these only the base ofthe Vijayanagara throne-room, and some remains in [Page 364] Ceylon,have survived. Several cities of Rajasthan and Gujarat have finely carvedgateways from the medieval period (pl. XXIb). But, though seculararchitecture was no doubt highly developed, it is clear that India’s architectsand masons devoted their greatest energies to temple building. Workingaccording to strict traditions, but showing much ingenuity and originalitywithin the main standardized pattern, they erected monuments of fantasticbeauty with the simplest technical equipment. Many patient hands rearedthe sikharas above the plain, and capped them with great slabs of stone,raised on enormous ramps of earth, like the higher courses of the pyramidsof Egypt. Whether or not the architects and craftsmen were conscious of thesymbolism, the temple was looked on by some as a microcosm of theworld, as the open air sacrifice had been in earlier days. In sculpture, andoften in painting also, all the gods were depicted on its walls, every aspectof divine and human existence symbolized. Like Hindu civilization itself,the temple was at once voluptuous and austere, rooted in earth, but aspiringto heaven.

## SCULPTURE
In architecture there is no real trace of relationship between the brick houses of Harappā and the stone temples of Hindu India, and the art of building in stone seems to have been learnt slowly from the time of Mauryas onwards. The earliest sculpture of historical times, on the other hand, shows a generic likeness to that of Harappa, which we have already described (p. 20f). From the end of the Indus cities to the rise of the Mauryas over a millennium elapsed, with no surviving work of art to fill it.

Somewhere in North India the art of sculpture, no doubt in perishable materials, was certainly kept alive. The patronage of the Mauryan emperors, the influx of western influence, and growing material prosperity, led to its revival, and to the making of stone figures and reliefs which have survived to this day.

The capitals of Aśoka’s columns, some of which were perhaps made before his reign, are the earliest important sculptures after those of the Induscities. They are not characteristic of Indian sculpture, though they containmany native features. The famous lions of the Sarnath column and the lessfamous but more beautiful bull of the column of Rāmpūrvā (pl. XXIIIa) arethe work of realistic sculptors, owing something to Iranian and Hellenisttradition. Yet, if we did not know that the possibility of Western influenceexisted, we might suggest that the animal sculptures of the columns werethose of a school directly descended from the engravers of the Indus seals,[Page 365] which also show a realistic treatment very unusual for so early acivilization. The abaci of the capitals perhaps show native influence moreclearly than the crowning figures, and bear animals in lively postures,wheels, representing both the Buddha and the Mauryan World-emperor, andfloral and foliate designs in which typical Indian motifs appear side by sidewith some borrowed from the West. Other than the pillars there are fewremains of the Mauryan school, with its high polish and fine finish. Onebeautiful figure, the “Diddrganj Yaksi” (pl. XXVIa), bears the distinctivebrilliant polish of the school, but the treatment of the figure suggests that itis post-Mauryan. The yaksī bears a cauri, or ceremonial yak’s tail fly-whiskwith which kings and gods.were fanned; this shows that the figure wasmade as the attendant on another figure or a sacred object, which has now
vanished.

A number of figures of yaksas, somewhat larger than life-size, are the only other important free sculptures of the centuries immediately before Christ. They are strong, bull-necked and heavy, and, though not technicallyperfect, have an elemental solidity rarely found in later sculpture. Thetreatment of the ample abdomens of these figures has been compared withthat of the abdomen of the Harappā torso and gives further evidence of thesurvival of tradition over the long intervening period.

The most important sculptural remains of the post-Mauryan period are the carvings on the rails and gateways of the great Buddhist sites atBhārhut, Gayā and Sānchī. There is no absolute certainty about the datingof these remains, but the sculpture of Bharhut is in a less highly developedstyle than that of Gayā and Sānchī, and is probably the earliest, while thegateways of Sinchl, carved with great sureness and skill, are probably thelatest of the three. The series Bhārhut-Gaya-Sānchī is to some extentconfirmed by epigraphic evidence, and we may date Bhārhut c. 150 B.C. andSānchī about the end of the 1st century B.C., with Gayā somewhere betweenthe two. The criteria are not, however, absolutely certain, for it is possiblethat the backward and advanced schools were approximately contemporary.

At Bhārhut (pls. XXIII-V) the upright posts of the stūpa railings arecarved with yaksas and yaksis, beautifully finished and very decorative, likeall the best Indian sculpture, but archaic and uncertain in treatment. Theirflatness suggests that the artists were trained in the working of ivory, andwere laboriously learning to translate their skill into a different medium.

The medallions of the crosspieces (pl. XXIIIc-e), mostly depicting scenes from Jataka stories, have a similar archaic flavour.

[Page 366] The Gayā railing, enclosing not a stūpa but the sacred path where the Buddha walked in meditation after he had obtained enlightenment, shows an advance on Bhārhut. The figures are deeper, more vital, and more rounded, and the sculptors had by this time evidently gained greater mastery of their technique. Figures are no longer always carved flat on the stone, but begin to appear in three-quarter poses. Notable at Gayā are the medallions containing human heads, which have such realism that they may well be portraits.

The crowning achievement of early North Indian sculpture isundoubtedly Sānchī. Here a smaller stūpa (Stfipa II) is adorned withcarvings of very archaic character, according to some authorities older thanthose of Bhārhut. The railings of the main stūpa are quite unadorned, but, insharp contrast, the great gateways are carved with a multitude of figures andreliefs. From top to bottom and on all sides the massive square uprights andtriple architraves are alive with the life of the times. Yaksis smile as theylean in easy graceful poses, 4 or serve as brackets to the architraves(pl.XXVIIb), which are supported by massive elephants or cheerfullygrinning dwarfs. The flat surfaces of the uprights and architraves arecovered with panels depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha or fromJataka stories (pl. XXVIII). Cities are besieged, riders on elephants andhorses pass in procession, men and women worship sacred shrines,elephants roam the jungle; lions, peacocks, yaksis, nagas, mythical animalsand ornate floral designs fill the whole. Some of the motifs are evidently ofMesopotamian or Persian inspiration, but the whole is typically Indian in itscomplexity of pattern, its cheerful busy realism, and its exuberance.

The carvings of the Sānchī gateways were not carried out according toany preconceived scheme. The sculptors were not commissioned by themonastery, but by private patrons, who wished to gain merit by beautifyingthe stūpa, and they carved what their patrons told them in the way theythought best. Superficially the result was lacking in formal unity, but wasendowed with a unity transcending rule and pattern, the unity of aprosperous culture, pious in devotion to its shrines, and delighting in theworld it lived in and knew. The visitor, standing on the hill of Sānchī on asunny winter day, when the wild peacocks walk among the ruins and thegreat plain shimmers in the hazy distance, gets the overriding impressionthat this is the work of a happy people at one with itself.

Technically the carvings are of high excellence. The sculptors [Page 367]have now fully mastered their material. Their treatment, while not, ofcourse, realistic in the nineteenth-century sense, has transcended the ratherstiff formalism of Bhārhut, and is free and alive. The sculpture of Sānchīeverywhere gives a sense of certainty; the artists knew what they had todepict, and clearly saw in their mind’s eye how to do so.

At Bhārhut, Gayā and Sānchī, and indeed in all the Buddhist sculpture of this period, the Buddha himself is never shown, but symbolized by such emblems as a wheel, an empty throne, a pair of footprints or a pīpal tree (pl.

XXVIII). The obvious reason for this iconographical peculiarity is that he was so venerated that it seemed sacrilegious to portray him, but we have no literary or other evidence to confirm this. The aversion to depicting theBuddha may have been due to the fact that, since he had passed quite out ofthe universe, it was thought misleading to show him in human form. In anycase the familiar Buddha image of later times is not to be found at thesethree early Buddhist sites. The schools of Gandhāra (the lower Kabul Valleyand the upper Indus, around Peshawar) and Mathurā, both of whichflourished under the Kusana kings, vie for the honour of having producedthe first images of the Buddha. Most Indian authorities now believe that theBuddha image originated at Mathurā; most earlier Europeans supportedGandhāra, but some recent experts are less certain.

The school of Mathurā probably began at the end of the 1st century B.C., though some authorities would date it later. Working for centuries in the white-spotted red sandstone of the locality, it produced works which were carried far and wide, and had much influence on later sculpture. Some of the school’s inspiration was Jaina, and at an early period the Mathurā craftsmen were making votive plaques depicting the cross-legged nakedfigure of a Tirthankara in meditation, which may have inspired theBuddhists to depict their own teacher. Perhaps the most striking remains ofthe Mathurā school are the yaksīs from the railings of a stūpa, which wasprobably Jaina. (pl. XXIXa). These richly jewelled ladies, their figuresexaggeratedly broad of hip and slender of waist, stand in pert attitudesreminiscent of the Indus dancing-girl (pl. VIIIb), and their gay and franksensuality in a context of piety and renunciation gives another example ofthe remarkable antinomy of the ancient Indian outlook on life, which foundnothing incongruous in such a juxtaposition.

Rather outside the main range of Mathurā art are the Kusana royal statues, most of which were found at the nearby village of Mat, where the kings no doubt had a winter residence, with a chapel in which the memory of former monarchs was revered. The figures have [Page 368] nearly allbeen broken by succeeding rulers, and that of the great Kaniska, the moststriking of the statues, unfortunately lacks its head (pl. XXXa). Wearing thedress of Central Asia, a long coat and quilted boots, and grasping in onehand a sword and in the other its sheath, the king stands with legs apart, inan attitude of authority. This statue may be criticized technically as showingno sense of depth, being virtually in two dimensions. The sculptor wasevidently working on a theme to which he was not used, but he succeededin producing a work of much power, suggesting the hieratic royal statues ofEgypt.

The early Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the Mathurā school are happyfleshy figures with little spirituality about them, but later they developed ingrace and religious feeling (pl. XXXVIb). Though the Mathurā schoolowed much to earlier Indian tradition, it also borrowed from the North-West, and adopted more than one Greco-Roman motif. Through Mathurāthe style generally known as Gupta developed, and produced some of thegreatest Indian religious sculpture.

The school of Gandhāra was evidently influenced by the art of the Roman Empire, and some of its craftsmen may have been Westerners.

Though often called Greco-Buddhist, the Greek kingdoms of Bactria andN.-W. India had long vanished when this school emerged. It is not to theGreco-Bactrian heirs of Alexander, but to the trade with the West,encouraged by the rising prosperity of Rome and the eastwards march ofher legions, that we must attribute this syncretistic school. The Greeks leftonly a few lovely silver articles, beautiful coins, and one or two otherobjects, perhaps imported from the West. It was Kaniska and his successorsand their wealthy subjects who gave to the school of Gandhāra theencouragement and support through which it flourished. The newdevotional Buddhism demanded iconic worship, and figures of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas were produced in large numbers, as well as small votive plaques depicting scenes from the Buddha’s life or Jataka stories (pl.XXXIII).

The Mathurā sculptors drew inspiration for their Buddha images from theburly yaksa figures of the earlier centuries on the one hand and from themeditating Jaina Tirthafikara on the other. The Gandhara sculptors hadother models in the gods of the Greco-Roman World. Often their inspirationseems almost wholly Western (pl. XXXI), and it is hard not to believe thatsome of the Gandhāra masters were foreigners from Syria or Alexandria.

The school has depreciated in recent years. When all art was judged byclassical norms it was thought to be the finest school of Indian art, whichonce and once only produced work of grace and realism. Now the sculptureof [Page 369] Gandhara is sometimes described as a mere imitation of animitation, the weak copy of a great art in decline. Neither judgement is fair.

In an Indian context the style of Gandhāra has a rather insipid flavour, but it is not without originality. The Buddhas of Gandhāra, though perhaps lacking in the spirituality of those of the Gupta period, are gentle, gracefuland compassionate, while some of the plaques are vivid and energetic. Theschool continued after the great Kusanas, though with less prosperous timesit produced few works in stone, but many in plaster or stucco. Its influencewas felt far beyond the bounds of India, and can be traced even in China.

While these schools were developing in the North others appeared in thePeninsula. Here, in the Bhājā cave (p. 353) and at Udayagiri in Orissā, veryancient sculpture is to be found, possibly no later than that of Bhārhut. Thegreat Buddhist cave temples of the Western Deccan contain much sculptureof great merit, perhaps the finest of which are the numerous figures ofdonors, often carved in high relief on the cave walls. These are frequently incouples, their arms on one another’s shoulders, and seem to be idealizedportraits of the wealthy patrons of the Buddhist caves (pl. XXXIV). Suchcouples are also to be found in early terracottas (pl. LXIIb), and no doubttheir originals believed that by placing their effigies in shrines they wouldobtain both material and spiritual benefits. It may be that these are theforerunners of the maithuna couples of the medieval temples (p. 362), butthe spirit behind the early dampati pairs seems very different, for thesefigures have no overt sexual significance. The man usually looks not at hiswife but outwards into the hall, while the woman glances downwards, and,quite unlike the bold yaksis of the North, holds her body diffidently, almosttimidly, as if rather embarrassed at being stared at in public. We believe thatthese figures represent the ideals of ancient Indian married life, and are nomore esoteric than the family memorial brasses in many English churches.

The region between the lower valleys of the Kīstna and Godavari became an important centre of Buddhism at least as early as the 2nd century B.C., and some very ancient sculpture in low relief, intended to adorn the sides ofstuipas, is to be found there. This already shows the characteristicelongation of the mature style of Amaravatl. In the late Sātavāhana period(2nd-3rd century A.D.) the great stūpa of Amarāvatī was adorned withlimestone reliefs depicting scenes of the Buddha’s life and surrounded withfree-standing Buddha figures. The relief medallions are certainly among thegreatest works of Indian art (pl. XXXV). Beautifully balanced incomposition to fit the circular frames, they convey an intense vitality andsense of rapid movement, quite unexpected in the context of the grave andcalm [Page 370] religion they illustrate. The slender, long-legged figuresare portrayed in vigorous action, often rising almost to frenzy, as in thefamous medallion showing a host of ecstatic demigods carrying theBuddha’s begging-bowl to heaven. The Amarāvatī school had greatinfluence. Its products were carried to Ceylon and South-East Asia and hada marked effect on local styles, while its influence on later South Indiansculpture is also very evident.

Meanwhile in the North the gaka and Kusana invaders had in partretreated and in part merged with the indigenous population, to make wayfor the great Gupta empire. From the point of view of art the Gupta Periodis generally taken to include at least the 4th-6th centuries and the first halfof the 7th. The plastic remains of this age are comparatively few, butenough survive to show the achievement of the time. If the schools ofBhārhut, Sānchī and Mathurā are marked by a sensual earthiness, and thatof Amarāvatī by vital, excited movement, the Guptan sculpture suggestsserenity, security and certainty. It was at this time that India produced someof her most truly religious art, especially in the lovely Buddhas of Sārnāth.

Most famous of these is the icon of the Buddha “turning the Wheel of the Law”, or preaching his first sermon (pl. XXXVIa), which, more than any other Indian sculpture, seems to convey the true message of Buddhism.

Surrounded by a large and ornate halo, flanked by two small demigods, the Master sits majestically, his body slender and rounded, plastically so simplified that no trace of muscular contour can be seen, his delicate fingers forming the dharmacakra mudrā, which indicates that he is preaching. His face is, as usual, that of a young man, with delicately modelled lips; his half-closed eyes and slight smile tell more graphically and vividly than any of the rather dry Buddhist scriptures his fundamental message, and emphasize not its. first part, that the world is full of sorrow, death and decay, but that it is possible to transcend these evils, and reach a state where age and grief no longer affect the mind, and where earthly pleasure is transmuted into serene inner joy.

This great masterpiece, however, illustrates only one aspect of Gupta art.

In the region of Gwalior and Jhānsī an excellent school of Hindu sculptors existed, and the carvings of the temple of Deogarh, depicting Hindu gods and mythological scenes, show the beginnings of the early medieval style.

The splendid figure of the sun-god Sūrya from Gwalior (pl. XXXVIIa) illustrates another aspect of the outlook of the times. Broad and sturdy,cheerfully smiling, the god looks straight ahead at his worshippers, his righthand raised in blessing-the god of a good-natured, happy people. Equallysignificant of the spirit of the Gupta Period, if less perfect [Page 371] inexecution, is the charming relief of a dancer, accompanied by girlmusicians,found at Pāwayā, near Gwalior (pl. XXXVIIb). Another famous Guptansculpture is the “Sānchī Torso “, 5 the delicately but vigorously modelledbody of a Bodhisattva, its smooth contours emphasized by the minutelycarved jewelled collar and belt and the scarf of antelope skin hanging overthe left shoulder (pl. XXXVIII).

Perhaps the most immediately impressive of all Guptan sculpture is the Great Boar, carved in relief at the entrance of a cave at Udayagiri, nearBhilsa (pl. XXXVIIc). The body of the god Visnu, who became a mightyboar to rescue the earth from the cosmic ocean (p. 302), conveys theimpression of a great primeval power working for good against the forcesof chaos and destruction, and bears a message of hope, strength andassurance. The greatness of the god in comparison with his creation isbrought out by the tiny female figure of the personified earth, clinging tohis tusk. The deep feeling which inspired the carving of this figure makes itperhaps the only theriomorphic image in the world’s art which conveys atruly religious message to modern man.

Sculptures of the medieval period are so numerous that they cannot be discussed here in detail. By this time iconographical canons were fixed.

Every god had his special attributes, which were regularly portrayed in his image; the proportions of body, limbs and features were laid down, and were adhered to with increasing rigidity; but the Indian sculptor succeeded in producing remarkable variety in his now almost hieratic art.

Under the Pala and Sena kings of Bihār and Bengal (8th–l2th centuries) both Buddhists and Hindus made fine icons, many in the local black stone.

The special characteristic of Pala art is its fine finish; its figures are much decorated and well polished, and often seem rather made of metal than of stone (pl. XLV).

The sculpture of Orissā was greater than that of the Palas. The carvingsof the temples of Bhubanesar and Konārak (pls. LIV-VIII) show a deepsensuous appreciation of the human form and an expressiveness whichgives them a characteristic beauty of their own. The finest Orissānsculptures are those in the courtyard of the Temple of the Sun at Konārak,where the forceful horses (pl. LVIII) and the mighty elephant crushing amalefactor in his trunk (pl. LVII) show a strength of treatment and a feelingfor animal form rare in the world’s art, and reminiscent of the animalsculpture and ceramics of the T’ang dynasty of China.

The Khajurāho temples are covered with figures of divinities and pairs of lovers of wonderful delicacy and grace (pls. XLVI-VIII), and [Page 372] in many other parts of North India many works of beauty survive, although few can vie with those of Orissā.

In the Deccan individual schools of sculpture appeared. The temples of Aihole and Badami contain fine work of the 5th century onwards (pl. XL), which shows the influence of the Guptan style, with a tendency to elongation perhaps inherited from Amarāvatī. More important are the sculptures of Mamallapuram, adorning the wonderful complex of rock-temples made by the Pallava kings of Kanci. Most striking of thesesculptures is the great relief of the descent of the Ganges (pl. XLI), coveringa rock face over 80 feet long and nearly 30 feet high. A natural cleft in therock has been utilized to represent the Sacred River, who is watched oneither side by gods, demigods, ascetics and elephants, as she descends fromthe head of Śiva, and who has sinuous snake-spirits ( ndgas) swimming inher waters. The artists who designed this splendid relief had a sardonicsense of humour, for among the worshipping ascetics they carved the craftycat, who performed penance in order to lure the mice to their doom.

Māmallapuram contains other fine relief sculpture, including an idealized portrait of the versatile king Mahendravikramavarman and his queens (pl.

XLII), and a number of free-standing animal figures, which are remarkable for their simple strength.

The influence of the Pallava school of sculpture was felt in Ceylon (pl.XLIIIa), and also in the Western Deccan. Here the Buddhist carvings of theAjanta caves, though important, are dwarfed in significance by thewonderful mural paintings. The carvings of the later Ellora caves, on theother hand, especially those of the Kailasanatha Temple (p. 354), are amongthe finest sculptures of India. They are chiefly in the form of deep reliefs,giving the effect of free-standing sculpture, and illustrate scenes ofmythology (pl. XLIIIb). The whole series of reliefs is characterized bybalanced design, and a graceful energy akin to that of Amarāvatī. Of thesame school, but a century or two later, are the cave sculptures ofElephanta. The rock temple of Śiva contains a fine series of deep reliefs, allof which are dwarfed in significance by the colossal Trimūrti, which isperhaps the best known of all Ancient Indian sculptures (pl. XLIIIc). Thethree-headed bust of Siva, calm with the calmness of eternity, is soimpressive and so religiously inspired that it needs little comment. Theserene god is perhaps the highest plastic expression of the Hindu concept ofdivinity.

After Māmallapuram, Ellora and Elephanta much stone sculpture was produced in the Peninsula, but though often of great merit it lacked the depth and beauty of the work of the earlier schools. The [Page 373] splendid bronzes of the Cōlas and their successors are the most outstanding products of the Dravidian artists of the later Middle Ages.



## TERRACOTTAS
While the rich delighted in figures of stone, metal or ivory, poorer folk contented themselves with small images and plaques of baked clay, no doubt originally painted in bright colours. Nearly every Archæological site in India, from Harappā onwards, has produced many of these terracotta objects. Most are religious. Crude clay figures of goddesses-apparently early forms of Durga, worshipped by the lower classes before her inclusion in the orthodox pantheon-are common, and recall the similar but even cruder mother-goddess figurines of Harappā (fig. ii, p. 13). Other objectshave little if any religious significance, though they may have been charmsor votive offerings; figures of mother and child, a type rare in sculpture,suggest offerings made by childless women, while the numerous figures ofa man and a woman (pl. LXIIb), standing in modest poses reminiscent ofthe donors of the cave temple sculpture, may have been charms for a happymarriage. While many terracottas are crude, others are of fine workmanshipand real beauty. Some faces are well characterized and divine heads aresometimes beautifully modelled (pl. LXIIc-d). The terracotta plaques oftenhave much charm.

Most of the terracottas so far found date from the Mauryan to the Gupta period, but the art of modelling in terracotta must have existed earlier, and certainly continued later, for the Buddhist sites of Bihār have yielded many medieval votive plaques of no great artistic interest.



## METAL SCULPTURE AND ENGRAVING
Several works of art in metal, very Hellenistic in style, have been found in the North-West, dating from the early centuries of the Christian era.

Some of these are quite un-Indian, and may have been imported, or produced by foreign craftsmen, for instance the lovely little golden and jewelled reliquary casket from Blmaran (pl. LXXXVIIa). Further afield, inSoviet Central Asia and Northern Afghanistan, have been found beautifulsilver cups and other objects, ornamented with motifs usually Hellenistic ininspiration and technique, but showing clear evidence of Indian contacts(pls. LXXXV-VI). Soviet archæologists believe that these are the productsof the Greek kingdom of Bactria, and date from the 3rd and 2nd centuriesB.C. Thus they are [Page 374] in no way connected with the Gandhārasculpture of the early centuries of the Christian era. Wholly Indian in style,and dating from pre-Gupta times, is the copper vase from Kulū, on theborders of Kashmir, engraved with a gay procession (fig. xxiii).

From the Gupta period a number of bronze and copper figures havesurvived, mostly Buddhist. The most impressive of these is the “SultanganjBuddha” (pl. LXIII), some 7½ feet high, now in Birmingham Museum-agraceful figure, dressed in a diaphanous cloak. Like most of the work of theperiod it conveys a feeling of aliveness, not by attention to realistic detailand proportion, but by the sense of movement in the slightly tilted body, thedelicate fingers, lightly clasping the corners of the robe, and the face,impassively symmetrical yet with a vitality imparted by the delicatemoulding of its features.



Fig. xxiii.-Copper Vase from Kulū, c. lst–2nd century, A.D. (By permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) The use of bronze images in worship seems to have been specially prevalent among Buddhists. The Sultanganj Buddha was found in Bihar, one of the great centres of Buddhism, where one of the two great medieval schools of metal sculpture arose, under the patronage of the Pala kings. Pala bronzes are so numerous that there is no doubt that they were mass-produced. They were exported to South-East Asia, where they are stillfound, and to Nepal and Tibet, where they provided prototypes forindigenous schools. These images are characterized chiefly by delicacy ofdesign and ornamental detail, and [Page 375] deep religious inspiration isusually lacking (pl. LXIV). The earliest Nepal bronzes, which go back toour period, are less ornate in design, but are gilded and set with semi-precious stones, and give an impression of great brilliance and smoothness.

Other parts of India also produced metal icons, but many of those which have survived have no great artistic value. The Tamils still prefer metal tostone for the images used in temple and domestic worship, and it was inSouth India, especially in the kingdom of the Colas, that the greatest Indianworks of art in metal were made, by a school of bronze-casters which hasnot been excelled in the world. South Indian bronzes vary in size, but manyof the finest specimens are very large and heavy, their pedestals fitted withlugs for carrying in procession. The best specimens of South Indian metalwork are of great grace and simplicity, for, though the statues have muchornamentation, this, as in most of the best Indian sculpture, is relieved byareas of bare smooth flesh. Physical features and the contours of face andlimb are simplified and idealized, the proportions are rigidly fixed bycanons laid down in iconographical textbooks, and every attribute of thedeity portrayed is determined by convention. It is surprising that, bound asthey were by these rigid rules, the Tamil craftsmen succeeded in producingworks of such great beauty and often of considerable individuality. As wellas images of the gods and goddesses the Tamil school produced manyfigures representing the saints of devotional theism, and portrait figures ofkings and queens, who, in theory, were themselves divine, and whoseimages were often placed in temples among the lesser divinitiessurrounding the chief god.

Of the latter class the finest figures are the life-size 16th century statuesof King Kīstna Deva Raya and two of his chief queens (pl. LXXI), whichstill stand in a temple at Tirumalai. The faces of the queens seem quiteconventional, though very beautiful, but that of the great king himself isalmost certainly intended to give some idea of his actual appearance. Theirhands pressed together in the gesture called añjali, to mark their homageand respect to the gods, their large eyes half closed, these three dignifiedfigures seem to represent all that was good and noble in the old Hinduideals of kingship, and, looking at them, we can understand why the kingmade so deep an impression on the Portuguese envoys (p. 76).

The greatest and most triumphant achievements of Tamil bronze casting are undoubtedly the dancing Sivas, of which there are many examples dating from the 11th century onwards (pl. LXVI). It was as “Lord of the Dance” ( Natarāja, p. 308) that the Tamil masters specially delighted in portraying the god-a graceful young [Page 376] man, his four armsdelicately posed, often with a flame in the open palm of one hand and ahalo of flames encircling him, one foot firm on the back of a demon, andthe other raised in a posture well known in the Indian dance. Thus the godappears as the very essence of vital, ordered movement, eternal youth, andethereal light. This is not the European conception of the highest godhead,but, once the religious background is understood, even the European canrecognize in the finest specimens of the dancing Śiva a true religiousinspiration, a wholly successful effort at depicting in plastic terms divinetruth, beauty and joy.

An important school of bronze casting existed in Ceylon, and produced works similar in style to those of South India. The finest metal product of Ceylon is undoubtedly the lovely large figure of a goddess, generally believed to be that of a Buddhist Tara, but perhaps Parvatl, the wife of Śiva (pl. LXV). This lovely and delicate casting, now in the British Museum, can hold its own with the greatest products of the South Indian bronzesmith.

Nearly all Indian bronzes were made by the “cire perdue” process. The figure was first designed in wax, which was covered with a coating of clay.

The whole was then heated, so that the wax melted away, leaving a mould to be filled with molten metal. Larger standing figures, such as the Sultanganj Buddha, which weighs nearly a ton, were often made in two parts which were then welded together.



## PAINTING
Literary references alone would prove that painting was a very highly developed art in ancient India. Palaces and the homes of the rich were adorned with beautiful murals, and smaller paintings were made on prepared boards. Not only were there professional artists, but many men and women of the educated classes could ably handle a brush.

Though now all in very bad condition the surviving remains of ancient Indian painting are sufficient to show its achievement. They consist almost entirely of murals in certain of the cave temples. No doubt most templeswere painted in some way, and the statuary was brightly coloured, as itoften is in Hindu temples today, and here and there more elaborate schemesof mural decoration were carried out. A few caves in outlying placescontain rough painted sketches of no special merit, often primitive in style,and believed by many authorities to be prehistoric. Some of the artificialcaves dedicated to religious purposes, however, give us samples of the workof highly developed schools of painting, and few would dispute that themurals [Page 377] of Ajanta are among the greatest surviving paintings ofany ancient civilization.

Avalokitesvara-Padmapani. Mural painting, Ajantā. Gupta Period.

## PLATE LXXII
The cave paintings of Ajanta (pls. LXXII-IX) are often referred to as frescos, but this term is incorrect, for a fresco is painted while the plaster isstill damp, and the murals of Ajanta were made after it had set. The wallswere first covered with a coating of clay or cowdung bound together withstraw or hair, and then finished with white gypsum. Considering the climatethe surface has stood well, but in many places it has flaked away, and evensince they were first copied in the last century the condition of the paintingshas deteriorated. The pigments, on the other hand, are still remarkablyfresh; in their original state the paintings must have been of great brilliance,and their colours are even now clear and well contrasted. The artists workedin the dim caves by light reflected from outside by metal mirrors.

The paintings in Cave X have been shown with fair certainty to date from before the beginning of the Christian era, while those of Caves I and XVIare from perhaps as much as six centuries later. The earlier paintings aremore sharply outlined and the later show more careful modelling, but thereis no good evidence of a progressively developing style, as in contemporarysculpture, and the differences may be accounted for by the personal stylesof the craftsmen who supervised the work in the respective caves. Themurals chiefly depict scenes from the life of the Buddha and the Jatakas. Noframe divides one scene from the next, but they blend one into the other, theminor figures and the pattern skilfully leading the eye to the central figuresof each scene. There is no perspective, but an illusion of depth is given byplacing the background figures somewhat above those in the foreground.

The effect of this convention is rather like that of a photograph taken with a telescopic camera, and makes the figures stand out from the flat wall as though coming to meet the observer.

Though painted for religious purposes the murals of Ajanta bear rather asecular than a religious message. Here, even more vividly than at Sānchī,we see the whole life of ancient India in panorama. Here are princes in theirpalaces, ladies in their harems, coolies with loads slung over theirshoulders, beggars, peasants and ascetics, together with all the many beastsand birds and flowers of India, in fact the whole life of the times,perpetuated on the dim walls of the caves by the loving hands of manycraftsmen. Everything is gracefully and masterfully drawn and delicatelymodelled.

Among the many masterpieces of Ajanta we must mention the figure of a handsome young man, his body bent slightly in the pose [Page 378] called tribhahga, loved by Indian sculptors and artists, with a jewelled crown on his head, and a white lotus in his right hand. His smooth features betray gentle sorrow, and his eyes look downwards compassionately, as if at something far below him (pls. LXXII-III). Around him are apsarases, orheavenly damsels, and divine minstrels, all much smaller than the centralfigure, who is the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara Padmapani, the Lord whoLooks Down in Compassion (p. 276). Here, once more, a work of deepreligious feeling appears among the cheerfully sensuous scenes of everydaylife. The Bodhisattva, for all his jewels and his smooth youthfulness, hasshared the sorrows of the world; his gentle eyes have seen countless ages ofpain, and his delicately formed lips have spoken words of consolation tocountless sufferers. The artist of the Bodhisattva has conveyed his message-the universe is not indifferent to the sorrows and strivings of its creatures.

Religious feeling of a different type is found in the painting of the glorified Buddha, begging his daily bread from a woman and child believed to represent his wife Yasodhara and his son Rahula. The lovely portrayal of the two minor figures is scarcely noticed against the majesty of the Master, whose calm features and robed body convey, like the Sarnath Buddha, the serenity of self-transcendence (pl. LXXV).

A few other paintings are to be found elsewhere. Those on the walls ofthe veranda of a cave at Bagh, some hundred miles to the North of Ajanta,depict a procession of elephants, perhaps more impressive in compositionthan anything Ajanta has to offer (pl. LXXX), and a lovely scene of adancer and women musicians ( frontispiece). Traces of paintings in theAjanta style are to be found in other Deccan caves, notably at Badami andEllorā. Further south, in the Tamil country, a Jaina cave at a place calledSātannavasal has yielded a fine, though much decayed, mural.

Some of the best preserved paintings of these schools are to be found in Ceylon. In the centre of the island a great rock, Sigiriya, the “Lion Mountain”, rises sharply for 600 feet above the surrounding plain. Here, at the end of the 5th century, the parricide king Kasyapa I built a palace and a fortress. Kāśyapa, evidently a megalomaniac, was so convinced of his owndivinity that he tried to identify his rock-fortress with heaven, and haddemigods and heavenly beings painted on the bare walls of the rock, toshow his subjects that he transcended them all. Nearly all these paintingshave vanished under the hot sun and driving monsoon rain, but half way upthe rock face, preserved by an overhanging ledge, are the figures oftwentyone apsarases immersed from their hips downwards in banks of[Page 379] cloud.6 These charming ladies, toying with flowers in languidposes (pl. LXXXIII), are so freshly preserved that one can hardly believethat they were painted 1,500 years ago.

The surviving traces of medieval Hindu painting, at Tanjore,Vijayanagara, Polonnaruva in Ceylon, and elsewhere, indicate that therewas some technical decline after the 8th century. Outlines become sharper,and the delicate modelling of the earlier period is lacking, but theachievement is still considerable. Scarcely anything survives from thisperiod in good enough preservation to make a satisfactory reproduction, butwhat can still be seen shows that the tradition of mural painting continueddown to the Muslim invasion.

After the spread of Islamic influence the Indian painter turned hisattention mainly to miniatures and book illustration, deriving muchinspiration from Persian models. Literary evidence shows that miniaturepainting existed long before the coming of the Muslims, however, and a fewexamples have survived from the 11th and 12th centuries from Bihār,Bengal and Nepal (pl. LXXXIIa). These little pictures show great delicacyand skill, but they lack the comparative realism of Ajanta, and the figuresare almost unmodelled. They are the products of a formalized Buddhism,the religious inspiration of which was languishing, and which was largelydetached from contact with everyday life. Unlike the Ajanta murals, theyare probably the work of monks, and not of secular craftsmen.

The dry sands of Central Asia have preserved paintings which, though not strictly Indian, owe much to Indian inspiration. The earliest of these surround a colossal rock-cut Buddha at Bāmiyān in Afghanistan (pl.

LXXXI) and are older than most of the paintings at Ajantā. The many murals and paintings on boards found at sites in Chinese Turkistan and other parts of Central Asia are mostly somewhat later, and show greater deviation from Indian models, though their debt to India is quite evident.

They date from a period when the trade route to China was wide open, and give proof of the debt which Chinese art, despite its very individual character, owes to India,.

## MINOR ARTS
The excavations at Taksaśilā and other sites of the North-West haverevealed fine jewellery (pl. LXXXIIb), with semi-precious [Page 380]stones set in gold filigree, much in the manner of the Indian jewellery of thepresent day. The Bīmārān Casket (pl. LXXXVIIa), and a few other objectsin gold and silver, are delicately worked, as are the crystal relic casketsfound in Buddhist sites in many parts of India. Engraved intaglio gems fromthe North-Western sites are usually of no great artistic merit, and nearly allthese small objects of art show the influence of western models, while somemay well have been imported.

Though little survives, much beautiful work was done in ivory. Guilds of ivory carvers are mentioned in inscriptions and their profession wasevidently a well-patronized and honourable one. Of surviving ivory workthe most interesting if not the most beautiful specimen is a small statuette ofa goddess, found at Herculaneum (pl. LXXXVIIb), no doubt imported withspices and fine textiles via Egypt. More beautiful are the ivory plaques,originally fastened to the lids and sides of boxes, found at the Kusāna site ofBegram, some fifty miles west of Kabul. Though discovered in the regionmost open to Western influence, the designs of these plaques are purelyIndian in inspiration, and they were either imported from India proper ormade by craftsmen who had learnt their trade from Indian masters (pl.

LXXXVIIc). The figures are outlined with deep-cut lines, and, althoughonly lightly modelled, give a wonderful impression of depth. Their delicacyand grace are unexcelled in any work of art of ancient India. The art ofivory carving has continued down to the present day both in India andCeylon (pl. LXXXVIII), but it has never again produced works as lovely asthese.

Since they delighted in minute detail and gave great care to the finish of their productions it is surprising that the Indians did not develop their coinage artistically. Ancient Indian coins are generally crude and ugly. Only under the Gupta emperors did they approach the status of works of art, and even the Gupta gold coins are but works of art of the second order. They

have originality and charm, however. Thus Candra Gupta I lovingly gazes at his chief queen, Kumāradevī; Samudra Gupta, enthroned, performs on the harp; Candra Gupta II slays a rhinoceros; and Kumāra Gupta I rides on a splendid elephant (fig. xxive). After this, however, the standard of coin production deteriorated rapidly, and medieval kings who patronized great artists and craftsmen were satisfied with coins of the crudest type.

Exceptional are the lovely large silver coins minted by the Greek kings of Bactria, which bear some of the finest numismatic portraits in the world (pl.

LXXXIVa-c); but the inspiration of these coins is purely Hellenistic, and they were no doubt designed by Greek [Page 381] craftsmen. It is unlikely that they circulated widely in India, where the Greek kings issued cruder bilingual coins (pl. LXXXIVd), in a style followed by the later Sakas and Kusanas (pl. LXXXIVe).

## MUSIC
[Page 382] There is some evidence to show that the Aryans knew theheptatonic scale, and the instructions for intoning the hymns of the SāmaVeda show that the style of liturgical singing in Vedic times was rather likethat of medieval plain chant, and has been preserved fairly accurately by thebrāhmans down to the present day. Between this and the early centuries ofthe Christian era we have little knowledge of the progress of Indian music,but in the latter period an anonymous writer composed a textbook ondrama, music and dancing, which, in accordance with the custom of thetime, he attributed to the ancient sage Bharata, and which has survived tothis day. The Bharata Nātyaśāstra is our earliest Indian authority on thesethree arts, and shows that by this time India had a fully developed system ofmusic, which differed little from that of present-day Indian “classical”music. Anyone who has heard a performance on the vīnā by a good SouthIndian musician has probably heard music much as it was played over athousand years ago. For this reason, and because of the highly technicalnature of the subject, we treat ancient Indian music briefly.

The basic scale is heptatonic, its seven notes 7 correspondingapproximately to those of the European major scale. They may beelaborated with half-tones or quarter-tones ( Sruti). There are twenty-twoquarter-tones in the octave, which occur in the following order:From this diagram it will be seen that the notes sa, ma and pa(approximately the European do, fa and so) may have as many as threedegrees of sharpness. The quarter-tones of Indian music are chieflynoticeable in ornamentation, when they are used with striking effect, butthey also occur to some extent in melody, so that the untutored Westernermay well think that the singer or musician is out of tune.

As well as the scale based on the note sa, corresponding to the European major, other scales may be based on other notes of the seven, thus resembling the modes of ecclesiastical music.
Besides the grāma, which we have translated “scale”, there are otherbasic classifications of tune-types, chief of which is the raga. A raga is aseries of five or more notes, upon which a melody is based. Over thirtyragas are mentioned in the Bhārata Nātyaśāstra, and the [Page 383] total has since grown considerably until now hundreds have been enumerated.

According to orthodox theory there are six basic ragas, the others being rdginzs, personified as the wives of the masculine ragas. The six originalragas are variously given, the oldest list, that of Bharata, being as follows:The ragas are classified according to the time of day or night for whichthey are most appropriate. Thus, of the examples above, Bhairava issuitable for performance at dawn, Megha in the morning, Dipaka andSriraga in the afternoon, and Kausika and Hindola at night. Bhairava isassociated with awe and fear, Kauśika with joy and laughter, Hindola,Dipaka and Śrīrāga with love, and Megha with peace and calm. It isinteresting that the raga most closely corresponding to the European majorscale, Pañcama, is associated with the night and love in the Indian system.

There is no harmony in Indian music, and the melody, which usually proceeds by conjunct intervals (i.e. adjacent notes on the keyboard), never suggests a harmonic basis, as do many European melodies. The tune issustained by a drone note and by drumming. The subtle and complex crossrhythms of Indian music take the place of harmony and counterpoint in theear of the trained listener. Like the ancient Greeks the Indians delighted andstill delight in unusual times, such as and. The tala, or rhythmic figure is,after the raga, the most important element of Indian music. Bharatarecognizes twenty-two talas, and since then many more have beenintroduced. Talas range in complexity from simple 2time ( aditala) and(rupaka, stressed as) to such remarkable rhythms as jhampa, a rhythm stressed:
or atā, which has fourteen notes to the bar, thus: When two or more of these complex rhythms, each ornamented with grace notes and varied by syncopation, are sounded together, the result is a rhythmic texture nearly as difficult for a European to disentangle as a four- part fugue would be to an Indian.

The Indian musician was, and still is, an improviser. While a simple melody could be recorded in alphabetic notation India never [Page 384] devised a true musical notation and the music of her ancient masters has vanished for ever. As at the present day, every performance was virtually a new composition. The musician would choose his raga and tāla and, often starting from a well-known melody, would elaborate his theme in the form of free variations, working up to a climax of complex and rapid kkornamentation.

The chief musical instrument was the vna, usually loosely translated “lute”. The term was originally applied to the bow-harp, often with ten strings, of a type very similar to the small harp used in ancient Egypt and the early civilizations of the Middle East (pl. XXXVIIb). By the end of the Gupta period this instrument had begun to go out of fashion, and its place was largely taken by a lute with a pear-shaped body, played either with the fingers or with a plectrum. This in turn was superseded in the 8th century by the early form of the modern vīnā, with long finger-board and small round body, often made of a dried gourd. Bowed instruments may have been known, but seem to have been little used in polite circles until thecoming of the Muslims. Flutes and reedinstruments of various kinds werewidely played, but instruments of the trumpet type were rarely used exceptas signals. Of these the most mentioned was the conch, the shell of a largemollusc, blown through its sawn-off point before battle, as an invocation toa deity, and on important occasions generally; its sound was veryauspicious. Percussion instruments were numerous and varied. The smallerdrums, played in pairs with the fingers as at present, were looked on asalmost essential for any musical performance. Larger drums were used forstate occasions, and there was a wide range of cymbals, gongs and bells.

The evidence of Bharata shows that, as at the present day, the Indian of two thousand years ago preferred the throaty, rather nasal type of singing, which comes more naturally than that which Europe has learnt to appreciate. The singing voice was often treated as a musical instrument, the vocalist performing long impromptu variations on a simple melody, sung to a single phrase, often an invocation to a deity.

In the late medieval period music became largely the preserve of professionals, who, though much in demand by the well-to-do people who employed them, were of low caste. This was not the case in India’s greatest days, when a knowledge of music was looked on as an essential attribute of a gentleman. “The man who knows nothing of literature, music or art,” runs an ancient Indian proverb, “is nothing but a beast without the beast’s tail and horns “.

## THE DANCE
[Page 385] Like music, Indian dancing has changed little with the centuries, and the best modern Indian dancers, such as Uday Shankar and Ram Gopal, still dance according to the rules of the Bhdrata Nātyaśāstra.

Dancing ( nrtya) was closely connected with acting (nj.tya); in fact both are forms of the same word, the latter being a Prakritism, and aspects of a single art, abhinaya, the portrayal of the eight emotions (p. 417). The dramaemployed chiefly word and gesture, the dance chiefly music and gesture. Asin most other civilizations there is little doubt that the Indian drama, whichwe consider in the following chapter, developed from ritual miming songand dance.

Indian dancing is not merely a thing of legs and arms alone, but of thewhole body. Every movement of the little finger or the eyebrow issignificant, and must be fully controlled. The poses and gestures areclassified in detail, even as early as the Bhdrata Nātyaśāstra, whichmentions thirteen poses of the head, thirty-six of the eyes, nine of the neck,thirty-seven of the hand, and ten postures of the body. Later texts classifymany more poses and gestures, every one of which depicts a specificemotion or object. With so many possible combinations the dancer can tell awhole story, easily comprehensible to the observer who knows theconvention.

The most striking feature of the Indian dance is undoubtedly the hand-gesture ( mudra). By a beautiful and complicated code, the hand alone iscapable of portraying not only a wide range of emotions, but gods, animals,men, natural scenery, actions and so on. Some hundreds of mudras areclassified in later textbooks, and they are used not only in the dance, but, aswe have seen, in religious worship and iconography.
This highly developed dance style demanded years of training, and was
probably always chiefly performed by professionals, though there are
references in literature to princes and their ladies dancing in their palaces.

Ancient India was rich in folk-dances, which were performed at festivals. In later years only low caste people would think of dancing in public, but there seems to have been no social taboo on the art in ancient times, except perhaps for practising brahmans.

1 It has been suggested that the stūpa, like the later Hindu temple, was thought of as a microcosm of the universe. There are Mesopotamian precedents for this belief, and the passion for cosmic symbolism, evident in India from Vedic times, certainly led to the making of the analogy at least in respect of the temple.2 But, though many authorities would disagree with us, we do not believe that cosmic symbolism played any great part in the thought of the ancient Indian architect.

2 The kirtimukha is found in other South Indian schools as a decorative motif, especially in the makara-torana, a gateway with a large kirtimukha mask above the lintel connected by foliate designs to two makaras or sea- monsters at the base of the doorposts. These motifs were exported to South- East Asia and became regular features of Indonesian and Cambodian architecture.

3 Often referred to by the modern vernacular names, bhog ma.dir, nat ma.dir, jagmohan, and deul respectively.

4 The tribhanga, a pose in dancing and dramatics with one leg bent and the body slightly turned at the hips, was a favourite with the sculptor from the earliest times. It contrasts sharply with the hieratic poses of most ancient art other than that of the Greeks, and gives an impression of life and vitality.

5 Said by some to be an exceptional Pala production. 10 6 Until recently these figures were thought to be portraits of Kāśyapa’s queens and concubines, and some of the faces seem to show individual character. Some authorities might still support the older theory, but the context of the paintings leaves little doubt that the above interpretation is correct.

7 Called sa.dja, rsabha, gdndhdra, madhyama, pafcama, dhaivata and nisdda, nowadays generally abbreviated to sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha and ni.

## LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
I. LANGUAGE
[Page 386]
## Sanskrit
IT has long been universally accepted that Sanskrit is a remote cousin of all the languages of Europe, with the exception of Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, Turkish and Basque. All the other European tongues look back to a common ancestor in a group of dialects spoken by tribesmen in the steppelands of South Russia some 2,000 years B.C. The relationship of Sanskrit to the languages of the West is indicated by several obviousresemblances, such as pitr, “father”, and mātr, “mother”, and many otherswhich are less obvious. For instance the Sanskrit ivan, “dog”, is cognatewith the Greek, the Latin canis, the German Hund, and the Englishhound, the Germanic h representing an original k. The Sanskrit cakra isrelated to the word with the same meaning in English, wheel, both of whichoriginated from a word pronounced something like kwekulo, which wasalso the ancestor of the Greekand the Old English hweogol, fromwhich our word “wheel” is derived. Many hundreds of relationships of thiskind, at first not obvious, have been established with virtual certainty.The reader with a slight knowledge of Latin or Greek will immediatelyrecognize the relationship between their verbal systems and that of Sanskrit.Thus the present tense of the Sanskrit verb as “to be”, is declined in singularand plural as follows:asmi, “I am”; smas, “we are”;asi, “thou art”; stha, “you are”;asti, “he is”;santi, “they are”.Vedic Sanskrit is in many ways closer than any other Indo-Europeanlanguage to the parent tongue, and it was the discovery of Sanskrit whichenabled Bopp, Rask, and other scholars of the first half of the last century toestablish a clear relationship between the languages of the Indo-Europeangroup and to develop the science of comparative philology.The earliest surviving form of Sanskrit,thatoftheṚgVeda,bearsaboutthe same relation to the classical tongue as does Homeric to classical Greek.At all its stages Sanskrit is a languageofmanyinflexions,buttheVedascontainnumerousformswhich[Page 387] later went out of use. The verb isof a complexity rivalling the Greek, with a bewildering array of voices andmoods, later much simplified. The Vedic noun, as in later Sanskrit, haseight cases, and both verb and noun have dual numbers.An important feature of Vedic Sanskrit is the tonic accent. Everyimportant word had an accented syllable, which was not necessarilystressed, but on which the voice rose in pitch, as in classical Greek. Thetonic accent of a Sanskrit word, is, with exceptions due to the special rulesof the languages, the same as in the cognate Greek word.Sanskrit, and most of the languages derived from it, are characterized bythe presence of aspirated consonants. Thus k, pronounced withoutappreciable emission of breath, is, to the Indian, quite a different soundfrom the aspirated kh, which is pronounced with a strong breathing, ratherlike the first sound of the English word come. To the average European, thedifference is hardly noticeable. The distinction goes back to the Indo-Europeans, and was made in classical Greek, though in Greek the aspirateletters 0, 9 and X had lost their original pronunciation before the beginningof the Christian era. Another phonetic characteristic of Vedic Sanskrit, alsosurviving to modern times, is the series of “retroflex” or “cerebral”consonants, t, th, d,.dh, and n. These, to the Indian, are quite different fromthe “dentals”, t, th, etc., though the European finds them hard to distinguishwithout practice. The retroflex sounds are not Indo-European, and wereborrowed very early from the indigenous inhabitants of India, either proto-Australoid or Dravidian. A further feature of the phonetics of Sanskrit is thepredominance of the vowels a and a. Vedic is a fine language, capable ofvigorous and noble expression. On p. 509 we quote two verses of the Vedic5hymns in the original, which will give the reader some idea of the sound ofthe language.5After the composition of the Ṛ g Veda Sanskrit developed considerably. Inthe early centuries of the 1st millennium B.C. old inflexions disappeared, andthe grammar was somewhat simplified, though still remaining verycomplex. New words, mostly borrowed from non-Āryan sources, wereintroduced, while old words were forgotten, or lost their original meanings.In these circumstances doubts arose as to the true pronunciation and5meaning of the older Vedic texts, though it was generally thought thatunless they were recited with complete accuracy they would have nomagical effectiveness, but bring ruin on the reciter. Out of the need topreserve the purity of the Vedas India developed the sciences of phoneticsand grammar. The oldest Indian linguistic text, Yaska’s Nirukta, explainingobsolete Vedic words, dates from the 5th century B.C., and followed [Page388] much earlier work in the linguistic field. Pānini’s great grammar, theAstāhyayī ( “Eight Chapters” ) was probably composed towards the end ofthe 4th century B.C. With Panini the language had virtually reached itsclassical form, and it developed little thenceforward, except in itsvocabulary.By this time the sounds of Sanskrit had been analysed with an accuracynever again reached in linguistic study until the 19th century. One ofancient India’s greatest achievements is her remarkable alphabet,commencing with the vowels and followed by the consonants, all classifiedvery scientifically according to their mode of production, in sharp contrastto the haphazard and inadequate Roman alphabet, which has developedorganically for three millennia. It was only on the discovery of Sanskrit bythe West that a science of phonetics arose in Europe.

The great grammar of Panini, which effectively stabilized the Sanskritlanguage, presupposes the work of many earlier grammarians. These hadsucceeded in recognizing the root as the basic element of a word, and hadclassified some 2,000 monosyllabic roots which, with the addition ofprefixes, suffixes and inflexions, were thought to provide all the words ofthe language. Though the early etymologists were correct in principle, theymade many errors and false derivations, and started a precedent whichproduced interesting results in many branches of Indian thought ( p. 82).

Though its fame is much restricted by its specialized nature, there is no doubt that Panini’s grammar is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of any ancient civilization, and the most detailed and scientific grammarcomposed before the 19th century in any part of the world. The workconsists of over 4,000 grammatical rules, couched in a sort of shorthand,which employs single letters or syllables for the names of the cases, moods,persons, tenses, etc. in which linguistic phenomena are classified. The greatterseness of Panini’s system makes his work very difficult to follow withoutpreliminary study and a suitable commentary. Later Indian grammars aremostly commentaries on Panini, the chief being the “Great Commentary”( Mahābhāsya) of Patañjali ( 2nd century B.C. ) and the “BanarasCommentary” ( Kāśikā Vrtti) of Jayaditya and Vamana ( 7th century A.D. ).

Some later grammarians disagreed with Panini on minor points, but hisgrammar was so widely accepted that no writer or speaker of Sanskrit incourtly or brahmanic circles dared seriously infringe it. With Panini thelanguage was fixed, and could only develop within the framework of hisrules. It was from the time of Pānini onwards that the language began to becalled Samskrta, “perfected” or [Page 389] “refined”, as opposed to thePrākrtas (“unrefined”), the popular dialects which had developed naturally.

Paninian Sanskrit, though simpler than Vedic, is still a very complicatedlanguage. Every beginner finds great difficulty in surmounting Panini’srules of euphonic combination ( sandhi), the elaboration of tendenciespresent in the language even in Vedic times. Every word of a sentence isaffected by its neighbours. Thus na-avadat ( “he did not say” ) becomesnāvadat, but na-uvāca ( with the same meaning) becomes novāca; Rdmas-uvāca ( “Rāma said” ) becomes Rama uvāca, and Rimas-avadat becomesRamo ‘vadat, but Harisavadat ( “Hari said” ) becomes Harir avadat. Thereare many rules of this kind, which were even artificially imposed on the Ṛ gVeda, so that the reader must often disentangle the original words to find thecorrect metre.

Panini, in standardizing Sanskrit, probably based his work on thelanguage as it was spoken in the North-West. Already the lingua franca ofthe priestly class, it gradually became that of the governing class also. TheMauryas, and most Indian dynasties until the Guptas, used Prākrit for theirofficial pronouncements. The first important dynasty to use Sanskrit wasthat of the Sakas of Ujjain, and the inscription of Rudradaman at Girnar ( p.62) is the earliest written Sanskrit document we possess, with the exceptionof a few inscriptions which are brief and unimportant.

As long as it is spoken and written a language tends to develop, and itsdevelopment is generally in the direction of simplicity. Owing to theauthority of Panini, Sanskrit could not develop freely in this way. Some ofhis minor rules, such as those relating to the use of tenses indicating pasttime, were quietly ignored, and writers took to using imperfect, perfect andaorist indiscriminately; but Panini’s rules of inflexion had to be maintained.The only way in which Sanskrit could develop away from inflexion was bybuilding up compound nouns to take the place of the clauses of thesentence.

In the Vedic and Epic literature compound nouns are common enough,but they are usually of only two or three members, like the English“houseboat”, or “blackbird”. In classical Sanskrit, on the other hand, theymay have as many as twenty or thirty members. Earlier classical poets suchas Kālidasā are comparatively restrained in their use of compounds, thougheven in poetry compounds of six elements are not uncommon; but theearliest royal panegyrics in Sanskrit employ enormous compounds. Forinstance the emperor Samudra Gupta is referred to as “binding together thewhole world by putting forth his strength and by [accepting] acts of service[from other kings], such as paying personal homage, the presentation of[Page 390] gifts of maidens, and soliciting his charter, sealed with theGarudaseal, to confirm them in possession of their territories” in a singleword of twenty components. 1 This remarkable use of long compounds maybe due to the influence of Dravidian speech on the language, for early Tamilhas few inflexions, and its words are put together in concatenations withoutdefinite indication of their relationship. If the components of a Sanskritcompound word are thought of as separate words, as in such an Englishphrase as “my top righthand waistcoat pocket” which in Sanskrit would betreated as a single compound word, the new constructions of the classicalperiod become intelligible.

With the growth of long compounds Sanskrit also developed a taste for long sentences. The prose works of Bāna and Subandhu, written in the 7th century, and the writings of many of their successors, contain single sentences covering two or three pages of type. To add to these difficulties writers adopted every conceivable verbal trick, until Sanskrit literature became one of the most ornate and artificial in the world.

The interest in language which India had shown from the earliest times continued in the medieval period. A number of valuable “dictionaries” survive from this time; these are not comparable to the alphabetically arranged dictionaries of the West, but rather to such works as Roget’s


Thesaurus. They contain lists of words of approximately the same meaningor used in similar contexts, sometimes with brief definitions, the wholearranged in simple verse. The most famous lexicographer, and the earliestwhose work has survived, was Amarasimha, by tradition a contemporary ofKālidāsa. Another form of dictionary, more akin to our own, was the list ofhomonyms, classifying words with more than one meaning.

Indian interest in language spread to philosophy, and there wasconsiderable speculation about the relations of a word and the thing itrepresented. The Mīmāmsā school ( p. 327), reviving the verbal mysticismof the later Vedic period, maintained that every word was the reflexion ofan eternal prototype, and that its meaning was eternal and inherent in it. Itsopponents, especially the logical school of Nyaya ( p. 323), supported theview that the relation of word and meaning was purely conventional. Thusthe controversy was similar to that between the Realists and Nominalists inmedieval Europe.

Classical Sanskrit was probably never spoken by the masses, but it was
never wholly a dead language. As the official tongue of church and state itwas read and spoken by the upper classes, and probably [Page 391]understood to some extent by many of the lower orders. It served as alingua franca for the whole of India, and even today learned brāhmans fromthe opposite ends of the land, meeting at a place of pilgrimage, willconverse in Sanskrit and understand each other perfectly.

## Prākrit and Pali
The language of the Ṛ g Veda was already rather archaic when the hymns were composed, and the ordinary Āryan tribesman spoke a simpler tongue, more closely akin to classical Sanskrit. In the Veda itself there is evidence of dialectal differences. By the time of the Buddha the masses were speaking languages which were much simpler than Sanskrit. These were the Prakrits, of which several dialects have been attested.

The everyday speech of ancient India has been preserved for us largely through the unorthodox religions, whose earliest scriptures were composed in languages approximating to those spoken by the people. Most inscriptions of pre-Guptan times, notably the great series of Aśokan edicts,are in Prakrits, and the women and humbler characters of the Sanskritdrama are made to speak in formalized Prakrit of various dialects. A fewworks of secular literature were composed in Prākrit. Thus there is muchmaterial for reconstructing the popular languages.

Prākrit were much simpler than Sanskrit both in sound and grammar.

Except for certain combinations which were easy to pronounce, such as doubled consonants, or compounds of which a nasal letter was the first member, groups of consonants were drastically simplified. Consonants at the ends of words disappeared, and, in some dialects, even single consonants in the middle of words were omitted. The diphthongs ai and auof Sanskrit vanished, as did the old vowels r and l, the correct pronunciationof which was almost forgotten very early. In one dialect, Māgadhi, rregularly became l, giving lājā for rājā. The rules of euphonic combinationwere practically ignored, and the dual number disappeared, while theinflexions of the noun and verb were much reduced.

One very important and early Prākrit was Pali, which became the language of the Sthaviravadin Buddhists. Buddha probably taught in Magadhl, but as his doctrines spread over India they were adapted to thelocal dialects. The language chosen by the Sthaviravadins was a Westernone, probably spoken in the region of Sānchī and Ujjayini. Pali, which isstill the religious language of the Buddhists of Ceylon, Burma and South-East Asia, seems to look back rather to Vedic than to classical Sanskrit.

[Page 392] Magadhl was the official language of the Mauryan court, and the edicts of Aśoka were composed in it, though the language in which they are inscribed in different parts of India is evidently affected by local vernaculars. A later hybrid Māgadhī, somewhat influenced by the Western Prākrit and usually known as Ardha-magadhi ( “Half Māgadhī” ), became the sacred language of the Jainas, and a large literature is written in it.

Other important Prākrit were Śaurasenī, spoken originally in the western part of modern Uttar Pradesh, and Māhārāstrī, spoken in the north-western Deccan. Śaurasenī was particularly used in drama, for the speech of women and respectable people of the lower orders. Māhārāstrī was a literarylanguage, especially popular for lyric song. There were several other Prākritof lesser importance. By the time of the Guptas the Prākrit werestandardized and had lost their local character. The vernaculars had alreadydeveloped beyond them. What Panini did for Sanskrit others did for thePrakrits, and they began to bear little resemblance to the languages actuallyspoken. Dramatists, employing various Prākrit by convention, thought firstin Sanskrit, and produced their Prakrit passages by following mechanicallythe rules for conversion from one language to another as laid down by thegrammarians.

Another stage in the development of the Indo-Āryan language was Apabhramśa ( “falling away” ), a vernacular of Western India which achieved literary form in the Middle Ages and was used by Jaina writers in Gujarat and Rajasthan for the composition of poetry. Its chief characteristicis the further reduction of inflexions, which are in part replaced bypostpositions, as in modern Indian vernaculars. A similar degenerate Prākritwas used in Bengal by a few late Buddhist writers, and is the ancestor ofmodern Bengali.

The next stage saw the development of the modern vernaculars of North India and is outside the scope of this work, although the earliest vernacular literature is little later than the end of our period. One Indo-Āryanvernacular, however, had a long history behind it by this time–this wasSinhalese, the development of which can be traced in inscriptions andliterature from the 2nd century B.C. down to the present day. The prakriticdialect spoken by the early settlers of Ceylon was already far removed fromthe original Sanskrit. Influenced by the local speech, and also by Tamil,Sinhalese developed rapidly and independently. Very early the aspiratedletters, characteristic of most Indo-Āryan languages, were forgotten. Vowelswere shortened, and the short vowels e and o, absent in most Indo-Āryanlanguages, appeared, as well as a wholly new vowel, a, rather like that inthe English hat. Many words were borrowed [Page 393] from theaboriginals and the Tamils. By the beginning of the Christian era Sinhalesewas no longer a Prakrit, but a distinct language. Surviving Sinhaleseliterature dates from the 9th century A.D., but it is certain that there wasmuch earlier work which is now lost.

## Dravidian Languages
While the modern Indo-Āryan languages, with the exception of Sinhalese, had not found literary expression at the time of the Muslim invasion, the Dravidian languages had been flourishing for centuries.

Four of these tongues have distinctive scripts and written literatures- Tamil, Canarese, Telugu and Malayalam. Of these Tamil is spoken in the south, from Cape Comorin to Madras, Canarese in Mysore and parts of Hyderabad, Telugu from Madras northward to the borders of Orissā and Malayalam in Malabar. Tamril is certainly the oldest of these languages, with a literature going back to the early centuries A.D.

Some authorities believe that the Dravidian languages are remotely affiliated to the Finno-Ugrian group, which includes Finnish and Hungarian.2 If this is the case it involves interesting corollaries concerning prehistoric race movements, but the hypothesis is not absolutely certain.

Dravidian is virtually an independent group of languages with a distinctivecharacter. Its sound system is rich in retroflex consonants, which give it acrisp flavour, and its varied vowels ( including e and o, not present inSanskrit) distinguish it from the northern languages, where the vowels a anda predominate. Like Sanskrit it has a complicated system of euphoniccombination. It does not recognize the aspirated consonants of Indo-Aryanlanguages-by the peculiar phonetic laws of Tamil, Sanskrit bhumi ( “earth” )becomes in Tamil pumi.

Tamil is not inflected, in the sense that Sanskrit is, but the relations of one word with another, and the number, person and tense of verbs, are shown by suffixes, which may be piled up one upon another indefinitely.

Sanskrit began to affect the language very early, and by the Middle Ages
the learned looked on their suffixes as nominal and verbal endings, on theanalogy of Sanskrit. In the oldest texts, however, these suffixes aresparingly used, and related words are juxtaposed in clusters, with few if anyindications of their relationship one to another-a system similar to the greatcompound words of Sanskrit, and giving much difficulty to all but theexpert.

The earliest Tamil literature contains comparatively few Sanskrit loan- words, and those it does contain are generally adapted to the Tamil phonetic system. The gradual growth of Āryan influence resulted in the borrowing ofmany more words in the Middle Ages, [Page 394] often in their correctSanskrit form. Telugu and Canarese, which are spoken further north, arenaturally even more strongly influenced by Sanskrit. Canarese first appearsin inscriptions at the end of the 6th century, and its earliest surviving

literature goes back to the 9th. Telugu does not appear as a literary language until the 12th century and only becomes really important under the Vijayanagara Empire, of which it was the court language. Malayalam, very closely akin to Tamil, became a separate language in the 11th century. 
## Writing
We have seen that the people of the Harappā Culture had a script, which cannot be deciphered. From the time of the fall of Harappa, perhaps about1550 B.C., to the middle of the 3rd century B.C. no Indian written materialhas survived. References to writing occur in the Pali scriptures of theBuddhists, and in the Sūtra literature, but there is no clear mention of it inthe Vedas, brāhmanas or Upanisads. This negative evidence, however, is notwholly conclusive, and some form of script may have been used bymerchants. The Aśokan inscriptions, which are the earliest importantwritten documents of India, are engraved in scripts almost perfectly adaptedto the expression of Indian sounds. It is generally thought that the scriptshad many years, perhaps many centuries, of development before the days ofAśoka.

The Aśokan edicts employ two scripts. The most important, usedeverywhere in India except the North-West, was Brāhmī, about the origin ofwhich two theories exist. Most Indian authorities would now maintain thatthe script was derived from that of Harappa. Many Europeans and someIndians believe that it was derived from a Semitic script. The first theory,tentatively put forward by Sir Alexander Cunningham and elaborated by theAssyriologist Professor S. Langdon, 3 has many difficulties. Until we knowthe pronunciation of the 270 Harappā signs we cannot be sure that thedozen or so letters of the Brāhmī script which somewhat resemble them arederived from them, and with so many Harappā signs it is unlikely that noresemblances at all should have been found. Similarities between Brāhmīand some early North Semitic scripts are perhaps more striking, especiallyas the latter offer only twenty-two letters to choose from, 4 but theresemblances are still not strong enough to be altogether convincing, andthe whole problem needs reopening.

Brāhmī ( fig. xxv) is normally read from left to right, as are European scripts, while the Semitic scripts read from right to left. A very defective series of Aśokan inscriptions at Yerragudi in [Page 396] Andhra, a very early Sinhalese inscription, and an early coin from Eran in Madhya Pradesh, are read from right to left,5 which would suggest that this was the original direction of Brāhmī. But this is no evidence of its origin, since it is believed that the Harappā script was also read from right to left.

Thus speaks the King, Dear to the Gods, of Gracious Mien. When I had been consecrated twenty-six years I ordered this inscription of the Law

( Dharma) to be engraved. Both this world and the other are hard to reach, except by great Love of the Law, great self-examination, great obedience ( to the Law), great respect ( for the Law), great energy. But through my leadership respect for the Law and love of the Law have grown and will grow from day to day. Moreover my officers, of high, low and medium grades, follow it and apply it, sufficiently to make the waverer accept it; the officers on the frontiers do likewise. For this is ( my) rule: government bythe Law, administration according to the Law, gratification ( of my subjects)by the Law, protection by the Law.

Whatever its ultimate origin Brāhmī is so skilfully adapted to the sounds of Indian languages that its development must have been at least in part deliberate. In the form in which we have it, it is the work not of merchants but of brāhmans or other learned men who knew something of the Vedic science of phonetics. It may have begun as a mercantile alphabet, suggested by the shapes of Semitic letters, or by vague memories of the Harappā script, but by the time of Aśoka, though still not completely perfect, it was the most scientific script of the world.

The words of Semitic languages, based largely on roots of threeconsonants modified by internal vowel changes, needed few indications ofvowels to prevent ambiguity, and until comparatively late times vowelswere marked only at the beginning of words, and then not perfectly. The Greeks, when they borrowed the Phoenician alphabet, adapted it to expressvowels other than a by the introduction of new signs. The Indians, on theother hand, expressed their vowels by the modification of the basic letter,which was looked on as containing an inherent short a. Thus the Brāhmīletter t is not k, but ka. Other vowels were indicated by ticks attached to thetop or bottom of the letter, thus:;
.
Two consonants together were expressed by placing one under the other;thus t ka and ya combined to form kya. No word in Prakrit ends with aconsonant, except with the final m, which was expressed by a dot, thus: t’kam. In writing Sanskrit, at a later time, a consonant ending a sentence orline of poetry was marked by a diagonal stroke thus W k. The words of asentence were not generally divided, the final letter of one being combinedwith the initial letter of the other; with some modification this is still thepractice in the case of Sanskrit, though not of the vernaculars, and adds tothe difficulties of the language for the beginner.

Local variations of the Brāhmī script are evident even at the time of Aśoka. In the following centuries these differences developed further, until distinct alphabets evolved. Before the beginning of the Christian era engravers in the north, no doubt following the custom of scribes, began toadd little ticks ( called in European printing terminology serifs) to theletters, and to employ flourishes of various kinds. The tendency toornamentation increased with the centuries, until in the late medieval periodthe serifs at the tops of [Page 398] letters were joined together in an almostcontinuous line, to form the Nāgarī ( “City” alphabet, also calledDevaNāgarī, “Script of the City of the Gods” ), in which Sanskrit, Prakrit,Hindi and Marathi are written at the present day. Local variations led to thedevelopment of individual scripts in the Panjāb, Bengal, Orissā, Gujarat andelsewhere.

Translation.
- In the year of Aya2 136, in the month Aadha on the 15th day. On this day the relics of the Lord ( Buddha) were deposited by Urasaka the Bactrian, theson of Irptavhria, a citizen of the town of Noaca. These relics of the Lordwere deposited by him in his own Bodhisattva chapel of the Dharmarajika( Stupa) of Taksasila, for the blessing of health for the great King, the Kingover Kings, the Son of the Gods, the Kual}a, and in reverence to all theBuddhas, 3 in reverence to all the Pratyeka Buddhas,t in reverence to theArhants.4 in reverence to all beings, in reverence to his mother and father,in reverence to his friends, his advisers, his kinsmen, and those of commonblood, and for the boon of health and Nirvana for himself. May rightrenunciation be widespread.

- Meanwhile in the Deccan scripts had been growing even more florid. InCentral India in the 5th and 6th centuries a script evolved which substitutedsquare boxes for the serifs of the northern scripts, and introduced severalother elaborations. The scripts of the Southern Deccan and Ceylon becamemore and more circular in form, until in the Middle Ages theyapproximated to those of the present day. The Tamils, on the other hand,evolved an angular script known as Grantha, which is still sometimes usedin the Tamil country for writing Sanskrit, and from which the modern Tamilalphabet is derived. Thus by the end of our period the alphabets of India differed little from those of today.

- It was from India, especially from the south, that the people of South- East Asia learnt the art of writing. The earliest surviving South-East Asian inscriptions, found in Borneo and Malaya, and dating from the 4th or 5th centuries, are in fairly correct Sanskrit, and in a script resembling that of theearly Pallavas. Though superficially very different, every South-East Asianscript, except of course the Arabic and Roman scripts in which Malay iswritten, can be traced back to Brāhmī. Scripts of Indian type have been usedas far eastward as the Philippine Islands.

- The origin of the other Aśokan script, called Kharosthī ( a strange term, meaning “Ass-lip” ) ( fig. xxvi), is not in doubt. It was certainly derived from the Aramaic alphabet, which was widely used in Achæmenid Persia, and was also known in North-West India. Many Kharosthī letters closely resemble Aramaic, and, like Aramaic, the alphabet is read from right to left.

- Kharosthī was adapted to the sounds of Indian languages by the invention of new letters and the use of vowel marks, which were lacking in Aramaic.

- It is generally thought that Kharosthī was adapted from Aramaic under theinfluence of Brāhmī, but the priority of the two scripts is not absolutelycertain. Kharosthī was little used in India proper after the 3rd century A.D.,but it survived some centuries longer in Central Asia, where many Prakritdocuments in Kharosthī script have been discovered. Later, Kharosthī wasreplaced in Central Asia by a form of the Gupta alphabet, from which thepresent-day script of Tibet is derived.

- The usual writing material was the leaf of the talipot palm ( talapatra, in Tamil olai), dried, smoothed, sized and cut into strips. [Page 399] To form a book a number of such strips was held loosely together by a cord passed through a hole in the centre of the leaf, or, in the case of large books, by twocords at either end. The book was usually strengthened by wooden covers,which were often lacquered and painted ( pl. LXXXIIa). Palm leaves are stillsometimes used as writing material in the outlying parts of South India. In the Himalayan districts, where supplies of dried palm leaf were difficult toobtain, it was replaced by the inner bark of the birch tree, which, carefully pared and smoothed, served the purpose excellently. As well as these materials, sized cotton and silk, and thin slips of wood or bamboo were also used, and important documents were engraved on copper plates ( pl. LXXXIX). Paper, traditionally invented in China in the early.2nd century A.D., may have been known in North India and it was certainly widely used in Central Asia. 6
- In most of India ink made from lampblack or charcoal, applied with a reed pen, was the usual writing medium. In the South, however, the letters were usually scratched on the palm-leaf with a stylus, and the leaf then rubbed over with finely powdered lampblack. This system of writing gave the letters a fine sharp outline and allowed the use of very small script; it probably encouraged the development of the angular forms of the Tamil alphabet. 5

# II. LITERATURE
## Vedic Literature
We have already dealt with the Four Vedas, the brāhmanas and the Upanisads in many contexts, and have given extracts from them ( pp. 234– 56). In their literary aspect many of these scriptures are of high merit, especially some hymns of the Ṛ g Veda and some parts of the early Upanisads; much, on the other hand, is dry and monotonous, or can only be appreciated after a considerable effort of the imagination. The 1028 hymns of the Ṛ g Veda are the work of many authors and show great variation of style and merit. Though their composition may have covered as many as five centuries, even the earliest of these poems is the product of a long tradition, composed according to a strict metrical scheme, 6 and a settled literary convention.

The collection is divided into ten “circles” ( masala) or books. Of these, books ii to vii are ascribed to individual families of seers, and contain theearliest hymns; books i, viii, and x are later, especially [Page 400] parts ofx, while the ninth book was compiled by extracting the hymns to the godSoma from the other parts of the Ṛ g Veda. The hymns contain manyrepetitions and the majority have a general sameness of outlook. Owing totheir archaic language and the obscurity of their allusions many passagesare not fully understood. The reader will already have obtained some ideaof the style of the Ṛ g Veda, as far as it can be conveyed in fairly literaltranslation, from the passages we have quoted. We add here a few furthertranslations of hymns of special literary merit.

Our first translation describes Indra’s fight with the cloud-dragon Vrtra.

The hymn evidently refers to a well-known legend, which has since beenforgotten, but which was probably a variant of the creation myth ofMesopotamia, in which the god Marduk slays the demon of chaos, Tiamat,and creates the universe. Here Indra’s function as a rain-maker is also inevidence, and, if the story was originally borrowed from Mesopotamia, ithad evidently developed far from its prototype. Interesting is the fleetingreference to Indra’s fear, from which it would seem that his battle with thedragon did not go all his own way. The last verse is evidently an addition by another hand.

“Let me proclaim the valiant deeds of Indra,
the first he did, the wielder of the thunder,
when he slew the dragon and let loose the waters,
and pierced the bellies of the mountains.

“He slew the dragon lying on the mountain,
for Tvastr 7 made him a heavenly thunderbolt.

The waters suddenly, like bellowing cattle,
descended and flowed on, down to the ocean.

“In his strength he chose the soma-
from three cups he drank the essence.

The Generous seized his thunderbolt,
and smote the firstborn of dragons.

“When, Indra, you slew the firstborn of dragons,
and frustrated the arts of the sorcerers,
creating sun and heaven and dawn,
you found no enemy to withstand you.

“Indra slew Vrtra, and Vyamsa, stronger than Vrtra,
with his thunderbolt, with his mighty weapon.

Like the branches of a tree felled by the axe
the dragon lay strewn over the earth.

[Page 401] “Like an enraged coward he called a challenge
to the great hero, the strong’s oppressor, charging.

But he did not escape the force of his blows-
the foe of Indra crushed the clouds together [in falling].

“Footless and handless, he still gave Indra battle,
until the thunderbolt struck him hard on his back.

The bullock sought to be match for the bull,
but Vrtra lay, his members scattered afar.

“The waters, flowing for man’s good, pass over him,
as he lies thus, broken like a reed.

Beneath the waters which he had encompassed
in his great might, Vrtra the serpent lay.

“The strength of the mother of Vrtra was exhausted,
and Indra bore away her weapon.

The mother lay above, the son below.

Danu lay like a cow beside her calf.

“Fallen in the midst of water-courses,
never pausing, never resting,
floods overwhelm the hidden corpse of Vrtra.

In a long darkness lay the foe of Indra.

“Lorded by Dāsas and guarded by the dragon
the waters lay, penned in as cows by a Pani.

When the opening of the waters was closed up
the slayer of Vrtra threw it open.

“O Indra, you became a wreath of vapour, 8
when he impaled you on his lance. Alone
you won the cows, hero, you won the soma,
and you let loose the Seven Streams to flow.

“Thunder and lightning availed him nothing,
nor the mist he scattered abroad, nor hail.

When Indra and the dragon fought he conquered,
as he, the Generous, will in future conquer.

“And what avenger of the dragon did you see,
Indra, as fear entered your heart when you had killed him,
when you crossed over nine and ninety streams,
as a frightened hawk crosses the skies?

“Indra is king of all that moves or rests,
of tame and fierce, the wielder of the thunder.

He is the king of mortals, whom he rules,
encircling them as a wheel’s rim the spokes.” 7
[Page 402] A number of hymns show deep feeling for nature, the most famous of these being the hymns to Usas, the goddess of dawn; but the hymns to Usas are perhaps less beautiful than the single hymn to Ratri, the personified night.

“The goddess Night has looked abroad
with her eyes, everywhere drawing near.

She has put all her glories on.

“The immortal goddess now has filled
wide space, its depths and heights.

Her radiance drives out the dark.

“Approaching, the goddess has expelled
her sister Dawn.

Now darkness also disappears.

“And so you have drawn near to us,
who at your coming have come home,
as birds to their nest upon the tree.

“The clans have now gone home to rest,
home the beasts, and home the birds,
home even the hawks who lust for prey.

“Guard us from the she-wolf and the wolf,
and guard us from the thief, O Night,
and so be good for us to pass.

“For darkness, blotting out, has come
near me, black and palpable.

O Dawn, dispel it like my debts.

“I have offered my hymn as a cow
is offered, Daughter of Heaven. O Night,
accept it, as a victor praise.” 8
Similarly sensitive to the moods of nature is the little hymn to Aranyani, the elusive spirit of the forest. 9
“Lady of the Forest! Lady of the Forest!

who seem to vanish from sight in the distance,
why do you never come to the village?

Surely you are not afraid of men!

[Page 403] “When the grasshopper replies
to the distant lowing of cattle,
as though to the sound of tinkling bells
the Lady of the Forest makes merry.

“Sometimes you catch a glimpse of her, and think it is cattle grazing,
or a house, far away,
and at evening you hear the Lady of the Forest
like the distant sound of moving wagons.

“Her voice is as the sound of a man calling his cattle,
or as the crash of a felled tree.

If you stay in the forest in the evening,
you will hear her like a far voice crying.

“But the Lady of the Forest will not slay
unless an enemy draws near.

She eats the sweet wild fruits,
and then she rests wherever she will.

“Now I have praised the Lady of the Forest,
who is perfumed with balm, and fragrant,
who is well fed, although she tills not,
the mother of all things of the wild.” 9

A few Vedic hymns are by our standards primarily secular. Of these the“Gamester’s Lament” is the most famous. Probably the poem was originallya spell to ensure success in gaming, addressed to the vibhidaka nutsthemselves. This was converted by an anonymous poet into a cautionary poem, which obtained a place in the Ṛ g Veda on account of its reference tothe god Savitr as attempting to reform the gamester.

“The dangling nuts, born where the wind blows the lofty tree,
delight me with their rolling on the board.

The cheering vibhzdaka has brought me joy,
like a draught of soma from Mount Mūjavant.

“She did not scold me, or lose her temper.

She was kind to my friends and me.

But because of a throw too high by one
I have rejected my loving wife.

“Her mother hates me; my wife repels me-
a man in trouble finds no one to pity him.

They say, ‘I’ve no more use for a gambler
than for a worn-out horse put up for sale.’
[Page 404] “When the conquering die has got his possessions
others embrace the gamester’s wife.

His father, his mother, his brothers say of him:
‘We don’t know him! Take him as a bondman!’
“I think to myself: ‘I won’t go with the others!

I’ll stop behind when my friends go to play!’
But then the brown ones 10 raise their voices,
and off I go, like a mistress to her lover.

“The gambler goes to the hall of assembly.

‘Shall I win?’ he wonders. His body trembles.

The dice run counter to his hopes,
and give his opponent the lucky throws.

“The dice are armed with hooks and piercing,
they are deceptive, hot and burning.

Like children they give and take again, they strike back at their
conquerors.

They are sweetened with honey through the magic they work on the
gambler.

“They play in a troop of three times fifty.

Like the god Savitr, they are true to their laws.

They will not bend to the wrath of the mighty,
and even a king bows low before them.

“The dice roll down, the dice leap upwards,
unarmed they withstand the man with arms.

They are heavenly coals, strewn over the board,
and though they are cool they burn up the heart.

“The forsaken wife of the gambler sorrows,
and the mother of the son who wanders afar.

In debt, in fear, in need of money, 11
he goes by night to the house of others.

“The gambler grieves when he sees a woman,
another man’s wife, in their pleasant home.

In the morning he yokes the chestnut horses.12
In the evening he falls by the hearth, a beggar.

[Page 405] “So to the general of your great army,
to him who is king, the chief of your host,
I say, stretching out to him my ten fingers:
‘I risk my all! I am speaking the truth!’
“Don’t play with dice, but plough your furrow!

Delight in your property, prize it highly!

Look to your cattle and look to your wife,
you gambler!’ Thus noble Savitr tells me.

“So make friends with us, be kind to us!

Do not force us with your fierce magic!

May your wrath and hatred now come to rest!

May no man fall into the snares of the brown ones!” 10 We need say little here of later Vedic literature. The Atharva Veda, in the main a monotonous collection of spells, contains a few poems of great merit. The prose brāhmanas and the various recensions of the Yajur Veda are in general without any pretensions to literary qualities, though written insimple straightforward language, very different in style from ClassicalSanskrit. Here and there legends are told in terse nervous prose, whichgains in effectiveness from its austere economy. We give the story ofPurūravas and Urvaśī, which is told in the Satapatha brāhmana as part ofthe instructions for becoming a Gandharva ( p. 238) by means of a magicalsacrifice. The story is as old as the Ṛ g Veda, for one hymn11 consists of adialogue between the earthly lover and his heavenly mistress, from whichthe verses quoted in the brāhmana version are taken. The story was verypopular in later times, and was the subject of one of Kālidasā’s plays.

“The nymph Urvasi loved Purūravas the son of Idā. When she married him she said: ‘You must embrace me three times a day, but never lie with me against my will. Moreover I must never see you naked, for this is the proper way to behave to us women!’
“She lived with him long, and she was with child by him, so long did she live with him. Then the Gandharvas said to one another: ‘This Urvasi hasbeen living too long among men! We must find a way to get her back!’“She kept a ewe with two lambs tied to her bed, and the Gandharvascarried off one of the lambs. ‘They’re taking away my baby,’ she cried, ‘asthough there were no warrior and no man in the place!’ Then they tookaway the second, and she cried out in the same way.

“Then he thought to himself: ‘How can the place where I am be without a warrior and a man?’ And, naked as he was, he leapt up after them, for he thought it would take too long to put on a garment.

[Page 406] “Then the Gandharvas produced a flash of lightning, and she saw him as clearly as if it were day-and she vanished … “Bitterly weeping, he wandered all over Kuruksetra. There is a lake of lotuses there, called Anyatahplaksā. He walked on its banks, and there were nymphs swimming in it in the form of swans.

“And she noticed him, and said: ‘That’s the man with whom I lived!’
‘Let us show ourselves to him,’ they said. ‘Very well’ she replied, and they
appeared to him [in their true forms].

“Then he recognized her and entreated her:
‘0 my wife, with mind so cruel,
stay, let us talk together,
for if our secrets are untold
we shall have no joy in days to come!’ …
“Then she replied:
‘What use is there in my talking to you!

I have passed like the first of dawns.

Puriiravas, go home again!

I am like the wind, that cannot be caught.’…
“Mournfully Purūravas said:
‘Today your lover will perish,
he will go to the furthest distance and never come back.

He will lie in the lap of disaster,
and fierce wolves will devour him’. …
“She replied:
‘Pururavas do not die! do not go away!

do not let the fierce wolves devour you!

Friendship is not to be found in women,
For they have hearts like half-tamed jackals!’
“And then she said to him:
‘When I dwelt in disguise in the land of mortals
and passed the nights of four autumns,
I ate a little ghee once a day,
and now I have had quite enough!’ …
“But her heart pitied him, and she said: ‘Come on the last evening of the
year, then, when your son is born, you shall lie one night with me.’


“He came on the last night of the year, and there stood a golden palace.

They told him to enter, and brought her to him.

“She said: ‘Tomorrow the Gandharvas will grant you a boon and you must make your choice’. He said: ‘You choose for me!’ She answered:
‘Say, “Let me become one of you!”’ “In the morning the Gandharvas gave him a boon, and he asked: ‘Let mebecome one of you’.[Page 407] ‘There is no fire among men,’ they said,’ which is so holythat a man may become one of us by sacrificing with it.’ So they put fire ina pan, and said: ‘By sacrificing with this you will become one of us.’“He took it and his son, andwent homeward. On the way he left the firein the forest and went to a village with the boy. When he came back the firehad vanished. In place of the fire was a pīpal tree and inplaceofthe pan amimosa. So he went back to the Gandharvas.“They said: ‘For a year you must cook rice enough for four [every day].Each time [you cook] you must put on the fire three logs of the pipalanointed with ghee … and the fire which is produced [at the end of theyear] will be the fire [which will make you one of us]. But that is ratherdifficult,’ they added, ‘so you should make an upper firestick of pīpal woodand a lower one of mimosa wood, and the fire you get from them will be thefire [which will make you one of us]. But that too is rather difficult,’ theyadded, ‘so you must make both the upper and lower firestick of pīpal wood,and the fire you get from them will be the fire.’“So he made an upper and a lower firestick of pīpal wood, and the fire hegot from them was the fire [which would make him one of them]. Hesacrificed with it andbecameaGandharva.”12TheUpanisadsrankhighasliterature, but their chief importance isreligious and they have been sufficiently treated and quoted in that setting.Epic LiteratureThe earliest Indian literature of a fundamentally secular character is thetwo great epics, the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyana, which, though workedover by a succession of priestly editors, give clear evidence of their originas martial legends. Their religious importance lay at first in the royalsacrificial ritual, part of which involved telling stories of the heroes of thepast. This put the martial ballads into the hands of the priesthood, who, intransmitting them, often altered their superficial character, and interpolatedmany long passages on theology, morals and statecraft.Of the two epics the Mahābhārata is the more important. It contains over 90,000 stanzas, usually of thirty-two syllables, and is therefore probably the longest single poem in the world’s literature. Traditionally the author of the poem was the sage Vyasa, who is said to have taught it to his pupil Vaiśampāyana. The latter, according to tradition, recited it in public for the first time at a great sacrifice held by King Janamejaya, the great grandson of Arjuna, one of the heroes of the story. Stripped of its episodes and interpolations the poem tells of the great civil war in the kingdom of the Kurus, in the region about the modern Delhi, then known as Kuruksetra.[Page 408] The throne of the Kurus, whose capital was Hastinapura, fellto Dhrtarāstra. But he was blind and therefore, according to custom, was noteligible to rule, so his younger brother Pāndu became king. Soon Pāndu, asa result of a curse, gave up the kingdom and retired to the Himalayas as ahermit, with his two wives, leaving Dhrtarastra on the throne. When Pāndudied, his five sons, Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, werestill children, and were taken back to Hastinapura to be educated with thehundred sons of Dhrtarāstra. When he came of age Yudhisthira wasconsecrated heir-apparent. But the sons of Dhrtarastra, led by the eldest,Duryodhana, resented the Pāndavas, and plotted against them, though theywere not legally heirs to the throne, owing to their father’s blindness and thestop-gap nature of his rule. After foiling a number of plots against theirlives the five brothers decided to leave the country, and travelled from onecourt to another as soldiers of fortune. At the court of the king of thePañcālas Arjuna won the Princess Draupadi in a svayamvara, and, to avoidstrife, she became the joint wife of all five brothers. Here they met theirgreat friend and helper, Krsna, the chief of the Yadavas. Soon after this theblind Dhrtarastra recalled them, renounced the throne, and divided thekingdom between them and his own sons. The fivebrothersbuiltanewcapital at Indraprastha, not far from the modern Delhi.But the sons of Dhrtarastra were not content with this settlement.Duryodhana invited Yudhisthira to a great gambling match. With the aid ofhis uncle Śakuni, who knew all the secrets of the dice, he won fromYudhisthira his whole kingdom, including his brothers and their joint wife.A compromise was arranged, whereby the five brothers and Draupadīagreed to go into banishment for thirteen years, spending the last yearincognito, after which they were to receive back their kingdom.At the end of the thirteenth year they declared themselves, and sent toDuryodhana demanding their kingdom, according to his promise; but hereturned no reply. So the brothers prepared for war. They had many friendsamong the kings of India, and were able to gather a great army together.

Meanwhile the Kauravas ( Duryodhana and his brothers) marshalled their own forces. The kings of all India, and even the Greeks, Bactrians andChinese, took sides with one or other faction, and two enormous armiesassembled on the plain of Kuruksetra.

For eighteen days the battle raged, until at last no important chief was leftalive but the five brothers and Krsna. Yudhisthira was crowned king and formany years he and his brothers ruled peacefully and gloriously. At lastYudhishira renounced the throne and installed Pariksit, the grandson ofArjuna, in his place. With their joint wife the five brothers set out on footfor the Himalayas, where they climbed Mount Meru, and entered the Cityof the Gods.

If we ignore interpolations the style of the Mahābhārata is direct and vivid, though it contains many often repeated cliches and stock epithets, which are typical of traditional epic literature everywhere. The chief characters are delineated in very simple outline, but [Page 409] with an individuality which makes them real persons. The blind Dhrtarastra is aweakling, anxious to do the right thing, but easily persuaded to evil. Of thefive brothers the eldest, Yudhisthira, is pious, righteous and gentle, but alittle negative in character; Arjuna is the ideal knight, noble, generous andbrave; while Bhīma is a rougher character, gluttonous and immenselystrong, but not very intelligent, and completely lacking in guile. Draupadi,their wife, is a woman of spirit, who is not afraid to upbraid her fivehusbands on occasion. The villain Duryodhana and his associates are notpainted in the blackest of colours, but have elements of nobility and couragein their characters.

Copy by J. Griffiths. Commonwealth Relations OfficeFighting Elephants. Mural Painting, Ajanta. Gupta PeriodPLATE LXXVIISome of the interpolated episodes are of much merit, while others are ofno literary value. The longest is the Śānti Parvan, a dissertation on statecraftand ethics, recited by Bhīsma, the elder statesman of the Kurus, as he liesdying on a pile of arrows after the great battle ( p. 80). This has been treatedelsewhere and has little merit as literature. The Bhagavad Gitā, the sermonof Krsna to Arjuna before the great battle, has already been quoted ( pp. 301,34of). There are many other theological and ethical passages, as well asmany narrative episodes. Some of the latter tell legends of the gods, butothers are more or less secular, including the famous stories of Rama andSītā ( p. 412f), Sakuntala ( p. 435f), and Sāvitrī ( p. 181). The longestnarrative episode is the story of Nala and Damayanti, told to Yudhisthiraduring his exile to convince him of the evils of gambling. It tells how KingNala won Princess Damayanti at a svayamvara, at which she chose him inpreference to the gods themselves, and then lost both his queen and hiskingdom at a gambling tournament, to regain them after many excitingadventures. This long story is probably as ancient as the main part of theepic, and is told in very simple verse. As a brief example of theMahabharata’s narrative style we give the description of Damayanti’schoice. Among the suitors at the svayamvara are four great gods, who,knowing that she is determined to choose Nala, have all taken hisappearance, in the hope that she will choose one of them by mistake.

“Then, when the right time had come, at the auspicious day and hour, King Bhima invited the lords of earth to the bride-choice.

“When they heard, the lords of earth, all sick at heart with love, in haste assembled, desiring Damayanti.

[Page 410] “Like great lions the kings entered the hall, firmly founded, with its splendid porch and shining golden columns.

“There on their several thrones the lords of earth sat down all decked in fragrant garlands, with bright gems in their ears.

“Their arms were thick as iron bars, shapely and smooth as five-headed snakes.

“With lovely shining locks, and well-formed noses, eyes and brows, the faces of the kings were bright as the stars in heaven.

“Then fair-faced Damayanti
entered the hall,
stealing with her splendour
the eyes and thoughts of the kings.

“When the glance of the noble
spectators fell on her limbs
there it was fixed,
and never wavered.

“Then, while the names of the kings
were being proclaimed,
the daughter of Bhima saw
five men of the same form.

“Whichever of them she looked at
she recognized as Nala.

Wondering in her mind,
the fair one was filled with doubt.

‘Of all the signs of godhead
that I learned from the elders
I see not even one
in those who are standing here.’
“Thus thinking over and over,
and pondering again and again,
she resolved that the time had come
to take refuge in the gods.

[Page 411] ‘I heard from the mouth of the swans
that Nala had chosen me as his bride,
and so, if that be true,
may the gods show him to me!

‘Never in word or deed
have I committed sin,
and so, if that be true,
may the gods show him to me!

‘The gods have ordained the king of Nisadha to be my lord,and so, if that be true,may the gods show him to me!’‘May the great gods, the world-protectorstake on their own true form,that I may recognizethe king of men, of good fame!’“When they heard Damayanti,mournful and piteousthey did as she had asked,and put on their true forms.

“She saw the four gods
sweatless, not blinking their eyelids,
their garlands fresh and free from dust,
not touching the ground with their feet.

“But the king of Nisadha had a shadow,his garlands were withered,his body bore dust and sweat,and he blinked his eyelids.

“The modest long-eyed girl
seized the hem of his garment,
and on his shoulder she placed
the loveliest of garlands.

“She chose him for her lord,
she of the fair complexion,
and suddenly all the kings
together shouted and cheered.

“And all the gods and sages
thereupon cried bravo,
and shouted at the wonder,
praising Nala the king.” 13

[Page 412] The second epic, the Rāmāyana, is rather different from the Mahābhārata in style and content. It is little more than one quarter of the size of the other epic, and of its seven books the first and the last are certainly later additions. The poem, like the Mahabharata, contains manyinterpolations, but they are much briefer and are mostly didactic. The mainbody of the poem gives the impression of being the work of a single hand,that of a poet whose style was based on that of the other epic, but showedsome kinship to that of classical Sanskrit poetry.

Though the Rāmāyana does not contain so many archaic features as the Mahabharata, and gives the general impression of being the later of the two, the Mahābhārata contains as an episode the story of Rāma, in a form which suggests that the editor of the final version of the Mahdbharata knew the Rāmāyana. The Mahdbharata as it is at present is probably later than the Ramayana, but its main narrative portions are appreciably earlier.

The traditional author of the Rāmāyana was the sage Valmiki, a contemporary of its hero. In fact the legend was perhaps committed to verse in the form in which we have it, but excluding the first and last books, a little before the commencement of the Christian era. The central scene of the poem is Ayodhya, the capital of the old kingdom of Kosala, and it evidently grew up in a milieu to the east of that of the Mahābhārata.

Dasaratha king of Kosala had four sons by his three wives; the sons’names were Rāma, Bharata, Laksmana and Satrughna. The four attendedthe court of King Janaka of Videha, where Rāma won the hand of Janaka’sdaughter, Sītā, at a great archery contest. Rāma and Sītā were married and for a time lived happily at the court of Dasaratha. ( In this part of the story,contained in the first book of the epic, Rāma is explicitly described as anincarnation of the god Visnu, and the original text has evidently been muchadded to and altered at a late period. )When Dasaratha grew old he named Rāma as his heir; but his secondqueen, Kaikeyī, reminded her lord of a boon which he had promised herlong since, and demanded its fulfilment in the banishment of Rāma and theinstallation of her own son, Bharata, as heir apparent. Dasaratha andBharata both demurred, but Rāma insisted on his father fulfilling hispromise, and went into voluntary exile with Sītā and his brother Laksmana.

When Dasaratha died Bharata took over the kingdom, but only as regent for
the exiled Rama.

Meanwhile Rāma, Sītā and Laksmana dwelt as hermits in the forest of Dandaka, where Rāma destroyed many demons who were harassing ascetics and villagers. Rāvana, the demon king of Lankā ( Ceylon), decided to avenge his fallen kinsmen, and, while Rāma and Laksmana were on ahunting expedition, came to their hermitage in the guise of an ascetic,seized [Page 413] Sita, and carried her off to Lankā in his aerial car( vimāna). The brothers sought far and wide for Sītā, and enlisted the help ofSugriva, the king of the monkeys, and his general, the brave and loyalHanumant. Hanumant went in search of Sītā, and, leaping over the straits, atlast found her in Rāvana’s palace. With the aid of a great army of monkeysand bears Rama built a causeway of stones across the sea to Lankā. After afierce battle Rāma, Laksmana and their allies slew Rāvana and his hosts,and rescued Sītā.

Sita had been treated with respect by her captor, and had in no wayyielded to his blandishments. But she had dwelt under the roof of anotherman, and Rāma, in accordance with the Sacred Law, could do nothing butrepudiate her. She threw herself on a funeral pyre, but the fire-god Agnirefused to accept her. After this proof of her innocence she was reunitedwith Rāma, and the two returned to Ayodhya, where Bharata renounced thethrone and Rāma was crowned, to rule long and righteously.

The last book, certainly an addition, gives an unnecessary sequel to the story, which was probably added on account of growing prejudice, and misgivings about Sītā’s lawful status after her unwilling residence in her captor’s house. The people murmured because their queen had been forced to break her marriage vows, and suspicions as to her purity were notallayed, even by her ordeal by fire. Though he was quite convinced of herinnocence Rama, whose first duty was to “please the people”, wasregretfully forced to banish her, and she took refuge in Valmiki’s hermitage,where she gave birth to twins, Kusa and Lava. Years later Rāma found Sītāagain, and acknowledged her sons. As final proof of her innocence shecalled on her mother, the Earth, 13 to swallow her up. The earth opened, andshe disappeared. Soon after this Rāma returned to heaven, and resumed theform of the god Visnu. 14The style of the Rdmdyana is less rugged than that of the Mahābhārata.

The latter contains occasional grammatical and prosodical errors, theformer few if any. It is a work of greater art, but less vigour, though itcontains many dramatic passages, and beautiful descriptive writing, whichthe Mahābhārata lacks. We give a much abridged translation of thedescription of the death of Rāvana, which is typical of the treatment ofbattle in both epics.

“Then Rāma, reminded
by the words of Matali,
took his flaming arrow
like a hissing snake….

[Page 414] “He spoke a mantra upon it
as the Vedas ordain.

The strong one placed in his bow
that great and mighty arrow. …
“Enraged he fiercely bent
his bow against Rāvana,
and, intent on his mark, he shot
the entrail-tearing arrow. …
“Bearing the death of the body
the arrow flew with great speed,
and tore through the heart
of the evil-working Rāvana.

“Then, red with his blood and rapid,
that arrow, destroyer of bodies,
robbing the life-breath of Rāvana,
drove into the face of the earth …
“Swiftly struck from his hand,
his bow and his arrow
dropped, with his life-breath,
upon the ground.

“Unbreathing, with awful speed,
the glorious lord of the demons
fell from his chariot to earth,
like Vrtra struck by the thunderbolt. 15
“When they saw him fallen to earth
the remaining demons of night
in terror, their lord destroyed,
fled in every direction. …
“Falling, struck down by the monkeys,
they fled to Lankā in terror,
their faces swimming in tears,
piteous at the loss of their refuge.

“And in joy the monkeys
roared a cheer of triumph
and proclaimed the victory of Rama,
and his slaying of Rāvana.

[Page 415] “In the sky there sounded
the lovely drums of the gods,
and there blew a pleasant wind
bearing a heavenly fragrance.

“A rain of flowers fell
from heaven upon earth,
flowers rare and lovely

bestrewing Rama’s chariot.” 14 The epic style and metre became usual for didactic literature of all kinds.

Much of this, the Puranas, Dharma Sastras, and other texts, has been referred to elsewhere. They contain passages of literary merit, but we must pass them over for the great body of courtly literature.

## Classical Sanskrit Poetry
The earliest surviving Sanskrit poetry in the classical style is that of theBuddhist poet Asvaghosa, who is believed to have lived at the end of the 1stcentury A.D., and who composed a metrical life of the Buddha( Buddhacarita) in a comparatively simple classical style. The GirnarInscription of Rudradaman, dated A.D. 150, is the earliest surviving exampleof courtly Sanskrit prose. Thus the courtly style is a comparatively latedevelopment in Indian literature, although it must have had a long period ofevolution before the dates which we have mentioned.

On the whole classical Sanskrit literature has not been well received in the West. Though the works of Kālidasā delighted Goethe, the literature taken as a whole has been called artificial, over-ornate, lacking in truefeeling, or even an example of wasted and perverted ingenuity. Indiansthemselves are not always satisfied with it. Thus a modern authority writes:“As a result of the particular demand in the court atmosphere the naturalspontaneity of the poet was at a discount. … Learning and adaptation tocircumstances were given more importance than the pure flow of genius. …As a result Sanskrit poetry not only became artificial but followed atraditional scheme of description. … The magic of the Sanskrit language …also led the poets astray and led them to find their amusement in verbalsonorousness.”15This judgement, which the author later qualifies, is in part correct. It is,besides, an indication of how deeply modern India has been affected byEuropean æsthetic standards, judged by which much Indian classicalliterature is indeed artificial. It was written mainly for recitation orperformance at court, or for comparatively small circles [Page 416] oflitterati, all well versed in the rigid canons of the literary convention andhighly appreciative of verbal ingenuity. In such circumstances it would befutile to expect the native wood-notes of a Clare or the natural mysticism ofa Wordsworth. The poets lived in a comparatively static society, and theirlives were controlled in detail by a body of social custom which wasalready ancient and which had the sanction of religion behind it. They werenever in revolt against the social system, and Indian Shelleys andSwinburnes are lacking. Most of this literature was written by men wellintegrated in their society and with few of the complex psychologicaldifficulties of the modern literary man; hence the spiritual anguish of aCowper, the heart-searchings of a Donne, and the social pessimism of anearly T. S. Eliot, are almost entirely absent. Despite its reputation forpessimism in the West, Hindu thought and literature is fundamentallyoptimistic, and the tragic drama, or the story with an unhappy ending, wasnot looked on with favour.

The chief raw materials of the Indian poet were love, nature, panegyric,moralizing and story telling. Religious subjects, in the sense of legends ofthe gods, are common enough, but deep religious feeling is comparativelyrare in courtly literature. A few poets, such as Bhartrhari, wroteoccasionally on religious themes with the intensity of deep faith, but for allits mythological trappings and polite invocations to deities classicalSanskrit poetry is predominantly secular. The gods, when they appear, haveusually the character of enlarged human beings.

Love was passionately physical, and we have said something of theapproach of the Indian poet to the subject in another chapter ( p. 17 If). As inmost European literature of ancient and medieval times, nature was usuallytreated in its relation to man, and rarely described for its own sake. Thephenomena of the seasons, day and night, birds and beasts and flowers, areemployed to frame human emotions, or are personified as counterparts ofthe human subjects of the poet. But throughout the literature a deep love ofnature is implicit, especially in Kālidasā who, for this reason among others,has a higher reputation in the West than any other ancient Indian poet.

Panegyrics, in praise of a king and his ancestors, are very numerous andform one of the chief sources of our historical knowledge. The element ofmoralizing is prominent in the writing of most poets. Kālidasā wasparticularly fond of including generalizations of a sententious or moralnature in his verses, and this practice was recognized as one of thelegitimate alamkiras ( “adornments” ) of Sanskrit poetry. Gnomic verses,often of a dry worldly-wise humour, were very popular.

The technique of poetry was thoroughly studied and rules were [Page417] laid down in numerous textbooks. The purpose of poetry is usuallydescribed as emotive; the emotion aroused, however, is not the pity andterror of Aristotle, but a calmer experience, an æsthetic sensation based onfeeling lifted to such a plane that grief is no longer felt as grief, and love nolonger as love-according to one definition “impersonalized and ineffableæsthetic enjoyment from which every trace of its component … material isobliterated.”16 The basic rasas or “flavours” from which this æstheticexperience should arise are usually classified as eight-love, courage,loathing, anger, mirth, terror, pity and surprise. Theoretically every poemshould contain one or more of these flavours.

An important element in Sanskrit poetic theory was dhvani
( “reverberation” ), the suggestion or incantation of words and phrases.

Words have their denotations and their connotations, their primarymeanings and their undertones, and it is with these latter that the poet has todo. By carefully choosing his words he can make them say far more thantheir bare meanings and induce a whole series of emotions by a single briefverse. Indian literary philosophers advanced far in this direction andproduced theories on the psychology of poetic appreciation which, in broadoutline, would not be inacceptable to many modern poets of the West. 16Perhaps the most important tool of the poet was alamkāra, orornamentation, which included simile and metaphor, generalization,punning, alliteration of various kinds, and so on. This branch of poetictechnique was also worked out in great detail by the theorists, and the freeuse of ornamentation resulted in poetry of great floridity. This wasencouraged by the enormous number of synonyms and homonyms inSanskrit, and by the very numerous and universally accepted stock epithets,such as “the mine of jewels” ( ratnakara) for “the sea”, “the unmoving”( acala) for “mountain”, “sky-goer” ( khaga) for “bird”, and “the frail”( abala) for “woman”. The ancient Indian poet would have been quite athome with Pope’s “denizens of air” and “finny tribes”.

The unit of poetry is the stanza, usually grammatically complete in itself.

The mahākāvya, loosely translated “epic”, often degenerated into a string of verses or groups of verses, linked only by a very slender thread of narrative.

In the more ornate courtly literature plot and construction are in generalweak, and there is little sense of balance. This is not the case with purelynarrative poetry, as in such works as the “Ocean of Story”, the author ofwhich tells his tales [Page 418] with economy and restraint ( p. 429ff). Andoften, even in the most ornate kāvya, the poet will from time to time rise tothe occasion with vivid and dramatic description, though it must beadmitted that the longer Sanskrit poem is usually prolix and shapeless.

On the other hand the individual verse is balanced and succinct. Single- verse poems, reminiscent of the Persian rubā’ī or the Japanese tanka, were very popular, either standing alone or included in dramas and prose works.

Many of these are very beautiful, and make an immediate appeal to the Western reader, even in translation. They were collected in anthologies, of which a number survive and have preserved many lovely verses which would otherwise have been lost.

Metrically Sanskrit poetry was quantitative, and rigidly regulated. Thenormal stanza was one of four quarters, each of length varying from eight totwenty-one syllables, generally equal and unrhymed. The Epics usuallyemployed the metre called śloka, of eight syllables to the quarter, whichallowed some scope for variation; but classical poets preferred metres ofgreater complexity and rigidity, of which many are listed in textbooks onpoetics, though only a dozen or so were popular. These metres allowed littleor no scope for variation and their syllables were arranged in complicatedpatterns, usually of great beauty. 17Owing to the structure of Sanskrit, literal translation of classical Indianpoetry into English is quite impossible, and we cannot convey the æstheticeffect of a Sanskrit verse. The brief extracts here translated in rhythmicprose give but a faint impression of the rich and closely knit texture of theoriginals or of the wonderful sonority of the language, which, when wellhandled, with all the arts of prosody and ornamentation, surely has asplendour unsurpassed by any other language in the world. Classical Indianpoetry, like Indian music and art, developed along lines of its own and itscanons are not those of the West, but it has its own special merits andbeauties.

Indian and European judges alike agree that Kālidasā was the greatest Sanskrit poet. He probably flourished in the reigns of the emperors Candra Gupta II and Kumāra Gupta I ( 375–455), and thus saw ancient Indian courtly culture at its zenith. Like the murals of Ajanta, his work seems toreflect that culture completely and convincingly. Though deeply imbued intradition, he carried tradition lightly, and throughout his work hispersonality breaks through. A few legends are told of him in late sources,but we have no reliable information about his life and character. From hiswork he seems to have been a happy and gentle man, sympathetic tosorrow, deeply understanding the moods of women and children, and lovingflowers [Page 419] and trees, beasts and birds, and the pomp of courtceremonial. He was the author of three dramas ( p. 435), two long poems,“The Birth of the War-god” ( Kumarasambhava) and the “Dynasty ofRaghu”( Raghuvamśa),andtwoshorter,the“Cloud-messenger”( Meghaduta) and the “Garland of the Seasons” ( Rtusamhāra),as well as of several other works which have not survived.

The “Cloud Messenger” is a work of little over 100 verses, which hasalways been one of the most popular of Sanskrit poems. Its theme has beenimitated in one form or another by several later poets both in Sanskrit andthe vernaculars. More than most Indian poems this work has unity andbalance, and gives a sense of wholeness rarely found elsewhere. In its smallcompass Kālidasā has crowded so many lovely images and word-picturesthat the poem seems to contain the quintessence of a whole culture. Itdescribes a yaksa who dwells in the divine city of Alaka, in the Himalayas.

He has offended his master Kubera ( p. 313 f), and has been banished for ayear to the hill of Ramagiri, in the modern Madhya Pradesh. The worstaspect of his exile is his separation from his beautiful wife, whom he hasleft behind in the mountain city. So, at the beginning of the rainy season, hesees a large cloud passing northward to the mountains, and pours out hisheart to it. After a verse or two of introduction the rest of the poem consistsof the yaksa’s address to the cloud.

First he tells it the route which it must take to reach the mountains; hereKālidasā describes the lands, rivers and cities over which it must pass invery beautiful verses. We quote two describing the river Narmadā and theforests on its banks. Notable in the first verse is the bird’s-eye-view impliedin the simile.

“Stay for a while over the thickets, haunted by the girls of the hill-folk,then press on with faster pace, having shed your load of water,and you’ll see the Narmadā river, scattered in torrents, by the ruggedrocks at the foot of the Vindhyas,looking like the plastered pattern of stripes on the flank of an elephant.

18
“Note by the banks the flowers of the nīpa trees, greenish brown, with their stamens half developed, and the plantains, displaying their new buds.

Smell the most fragrant earth of the burnt out woodlands, and as you release your raindrops the deer will show you the way.” 17 [Page 420] Then the cloud is told to turn westward and visit the splendid city of Ujjayaini. Kālidasā cannot long resist the śrngāra rasa, the eroticsentiment, and this is evoked by his description of the city,“where the wind from the Sipra river prolongs the shrill melodious cryof the cranes,fragrant at early dawn from the scent of the opening lotus,and, like a lover, with flattering requests,dispels the morning languor of women, and refreshes their limbs.

“Your body will grow fat with the smoke of incense from open windows where women dress their hair.

You will be greeted by palace peacocks, dancing to welcome you, their friend.

If your heart is weary from travel you may pass the night above mansions fragrant with flowers, whose pavements are marked with red dye from the feet of lovely women.”18 Then, as the cloud nears the Himalayas, it will see the magic city “where yaksas dwell with lovely women in white mansions, whose crystal terraces reflect the stars like flowers.

They drink the wine of love distilled from magic trees, while drums beat softly, deeper than your thunder.” 19 Then the yaksa describes his home, and his lovely wife, weak from sorrow and longing. He gives the cloud a message to her, that his love is still constant and that the time of reunion is approaching.

“I see your body in the sinuous creeper, your gaze in the startled eyes of deer,your cheek in the moon, your hair in the plumage of peacocks,and in the tiny ripples of the river I see your sidelong glances,but alas, my dearest, nowhere do I find your whole likeness!” 20“The Birth of the War-god” may be described as a religious poem, butthough all its characters are supernatural, and include Śiva himself, theatmosphere of the poem is essentially secular. It begins with a finedescription of the Himalayas, from which we quote a few verses. Thedaring comparison of the chain of mountains to a surveyor’s measuring rodis worthy of John Donne, and gives another example of Kālidasā’s bird’s-eye-view approach.

“In the northern quarter is divine Himalaya, the lord of mountains, reaching from Eastern to Western Oceans, firm as a rod to measure the earth….[Page 421] “There demigods rest in the shade of the cloudswhich spread like a girdle below the peaks,but when the rains disturb themthey fly to the sunlit summits. …“The hollow canes are filled with the windthat bursts from the chasms,as though to provide an ostinatoto the songs of heavenly minstrels …“All through the night phosphorescent herbsshine in the caverns with their glimmering radiance,and light the lovesof hill-women and their paramours …“And the wind forever shaking the pinescarries the spray from the torrents of the young Gangesand refreshes the hunting hillman,blowing among his peacock plumes.”21The poem, which is a long one, describes the courtship and marriage ofŚiva and Pārvatī ( p. 309), and the birth of their son, Kumāra or Skanda, thewar-god. As he grows to manhood Kumāra is appointed general of the gods,and he leads them forth to battle with the terrible demon Taraka, who haslong been afflicting the whole universe. Taraka hears of their approach,musters his forces, and goes out to meet them; but terrible omens greet thearmy of demons. Here Kālidasā embarks on a remarkable description,which reminds us of the more macabre work of Gustave Doré.

“A fearful flock of evil birds, ready for the joy of eating the army of demons, flew over the host of the gods, and clouded the sun.

“A wind continually fluttered their umbrellas and banners, and troubled their eyes with clouds of whirling dust, so that the trembling horses and elephants and the great chariots could not be seen.

“Suddenly monstrous serpents, as black as powdered soot, scattering poison from their upraised heads, frightful in form, appeared in the army’s path.

“The sun put on a ghastly robe of great and terrible snakes, curling together, as if to mark his joy at the death of the enemy demon.

[Page 422] “And before the very disc of the sun jackals bayed harshly together, as though eager fiercely to lap the blood of the king of the foes of the gods, fallen in battle.

“Lighting heaven from end to end, with flames flashing all around, with an awful crash, rending the heart with terror, a thunderbolt fell from a cloudless sky.

“The sky poured down torrents of red-hot ashes, with which were mixed blood and human bones, till the flaming ends of heaven were filled with smoke and bore the dull hue of the neck of an ass.

“Like the thundered threat of the angry death-god a great crash broke the walls of the ears, a shattering sound, tearing the tops of the mountains, and wholly filling the belly of heaven.

“The host of the foe was jostled together.

The great elephants stumbled, the horses fell, and all the footmen clung together in fear, as the earth trembled and the ocean rose to shake the mountains.

“And, before the host of the foes of the gods, dogs lifted their muzzles to gaze on the sun, then, howling together with cries that rent the eardrums, they wretchedly slunk away.” 2219 The poem ends with the death of Taraka in single combat with Kumara.

We have no space to discuss the rest of Kālidasā’s poetry, all of which is  of fine quality. “The Dynasty of Raghu” especially contains many passages of great beauty, including a concise version of [Page 423] the story of Rāma, but the work is apparently incomplete. “The Garland of the Seasons” describes the six seasons of the Hindu year in relation to srngara, the erotic sentiment, but though charming it is slighter and less impressive than the rest of Kālidasā’s work.

Many other poets after Kālidasā, wrote mahakavyas, or long courtly “epics “, but none so ably as he. Kumaradasa’s “Rape of Sītā” ( Janaki- harana) continues his tradition, while Bharavi’s “Arjuna and the Kirāta” ( Kiratarjuniya), describing an encounter of the hero Arjuna and the god Śiva, in the guise of a Kirata or wild mountaineer, is somewhat more florid.

Bhatti, of the 7th century, wrote a remarkable poem on the story of Rāma, usually known as “Bhatti’s Poem” ( Bhasikāvya), containing passages of real beauty, as an exercise to illustrate rules of grammar. Even more ingenious was the 7thcentury poet Magha, who wrote a long poem on an incident in the life of Krsna, the “Slaying of Śisupala” ( Śiśupāla-vadha).

Though the work contains many fine stanzas the story is so badly told that the poem as a whole has no semblance of unity. In the nineteenth canto, which describes the battle between Krsna and his enemy, Magha thought fit to display his mastery of language by inserting many stanzas of amazing ingenuity. We give an example of an ekāksara stanza, employing only one consonant throughout:
Dādado dudda-dud-dddi
dddaddo duda-di-da-doh
dud-dddam dadade dudde
dad’-ādada-dado ‘da-dah.

This stanza, using very rare and obscure words, and exceedingly
elliptical, may be translated as follows:
“The giver of gifts, the giver of grief to his foes,
the bestower of purity, whose arm destroys the givers of grief,
the destroyer of demons, bestower of bounty on generous and miser
alike,
raised his weapon against the foe.”23
The following is a dvyaksara, containing only two consonants:
Krūrāri-kārī kor eka-
kārakah kārikā-karah
korakākāra-karakah
karnrah karkaro ‘rka-ruk.

“The destroyer of cruel foes, the only creator of the world, bestower of woes on the wicked, with hands like the buds of lotuses, the overthrower of elephants, fierce in battle, shone like the sun.” 24 [Page 424] The next stanza is called sarvatobhadra ( “valid all ways” ), and is a complicated mixture of syllabic palindrome and acrostic. Each quarter-stanza is a palindrome; the first four syllables of the first quarter are the same as the first syllables of each quarter, and in the same order; the first four syllables of the second quarter are the same as the second syllables of each quarter, and so on. This verse is positively startling in its ingenuity, and when read in the original produces an impression resembling that of complex polyphony.

Sakāra-nān’-āra-kāsa-
kāya-sāda-da-sāyakā
ras’ -āhava vāha-sāra-
nādavāda-da-vādanā.

“His army was eager for battle,
whose arrows destroyed the bodies of the varied hosts of his brave
enemies.

Its trumpets vied with the cries
of the splendid horses and elephants.”25
Finally a stanza called gatapratyāgatam ( “gone and come back” ). It is a
perfect syllabic palindrome.

Tam Śriya ghanaya ‘nasta-
rucd sāratayā tayā
yataya tarasa cdru-
stanaya ‘naghay’ āsritam.

“He who was eagerly and close embraced by the fair-bosomed Sri, the sinless goddess, of never-failing beauty, and endowedwith every excellence.” 26After Magha longer poems often became mere displays of verbalingenuity. The narrative became progressively less important, and the style progressively more ornate, though there were important exceptions. Theclimax of the tendency came with the dvyasrayakavya, telling two stories simultaneously, by deliberately utilizing the ambiguity of words andphrases. A well-known example of this genre is the Rāmacarita ( “Deeds ofRama” ) of the 12th-century poet Sandhyakara, which may be read as applying either to the legendary Rāma of Ayodhya or to the historical kingRamapala of Bengal, who was the poet’s contemporary and patron.


Achievements like this are not to be disparaged, but they make little appeal to the European reader and are quite untranslatable.

PLATE LXXVIII

 Musme Guimet, ParisSeated Girl. Mural Painting, Ajantā. Gupta PeriodPLATE LXXIX[Page 425] The best things in medieval poetry are to be found in the singlestanza poems, of which there are many collections, either by one or many hands. The finest poet in this genre was Bhartrhari, thought to havelived in the 7th century, who left no long poems, but only three centuries ofseparate stanzas on the subjects of worldly wisdom, love and renunciation respectively. These are masterpieces of concise expression, and, unlike most Sanskrit poems, tell us much about the personality of the author. We quotefirst two stanzas in an amusingly sententious vein.

“You may boldly take a gem from the jaws of a crocodile,
you may swim the ocean with its tossing wreath of waves,
you may wear an angry serpent like a flower in your hair,
but you’ll never satisfy a fool who’s set in his opinions!

“You may, if you squeeze hard enough, even get oil from sand, thirsty, you may succeed in drinking the waters of the mirage,perhaps, if you go far enough, you’ll find a rabbit’s horn,but you’ll never satisfy a fool who’s set in his opinions!”27In his erotic verses Bhartrhari often shows an undercurrent ofdissatisfaction, as though trying to convince himself that love is not a futilewaste of time after all. In the midst of his amours he feels the call of thereligious life, and in one remarkable stanza he indulges in striking punningto this effect. The obvious meaning is:“Your hair well combed, your eyes reaching to your ears, 20your mouth filled with ranks of teeth that are white by nature, yourbreasts charmingly adorned with a necklace of pearls,slim girl, your body, though at rest, disturbs me.”But this might also be fancifully translated as:“Your hair self-denying, your eyes understanding the whole ofscripture,your mouth full of groups of naturally-pure brahmans,your breasts lovely from the presence of emancipated souls,slim girl, your body, though free from passion, disturbs me.”28This is the sort of thing which most critics of Sanskrit poetry object to;but Bhartrhari might justify his punning here, for by employing words withreligious connotations he has given expression to his own divided mind.

This is very forcibly expressed in another stanza, which we quote. “The forest” implies the life of the hermit.

[Page 426] “What is the use of many idle speeches!

Only two things are worth a man’s attention-
the youth of full-breasted women, prone to fresh pleasures, and the forest.”29
It would seem that in the end Bhartrhari gave up the love of women forthe love of God, though the word which we here translate “God” is theimpersonal Brahman ( p. 250).“When I was ignorant in the dark night of passionI thought the world completely made of women,but now my eyes are cleansed with the salve of wisdom,and my clear vision sees only God in everything.”30Bhartrhari’s religious experience was intense enough to produce thefollowing splendid pæan, in which he addressed the five elements of Hinduphysics.

“Oh Earth, my mother, Air, my father, Oh Fire, my friend,
Water, my kinsman, Space, my brother,
here do I bow before you with folded hands!With your aid I have done good deeds and found clear knowledge,and, glorious, with all delusion past, I merge in highest godhead.” 31An erotic poet with none of Bhartrhari’s doubts was Amaru, alsoprobably of the 7th century. His stanzas on love are often voluptuous, butthey can be humorously tender, and always show a sound understanding offeminine psychology. Amaru loved to describe a poignant moment in ahuman relationship in a single verse, in which the reader is given only theclimax of the story, the reconstruction of the rest being left to hisimagination.

‘We’ll see what comes of it,’ I thought, and hardened my heart against
her.

‘What, won’t the villain speak to me?’ she thought, flying into a
rage.

And there we stood, sedulously refusing to look one another in the
face,


until at last I managed an unconvincing laugh, and her tears
robbed me of my resolution.”
‘Why are your limbs so weak, and why do you tremble?

And why, my dear,’ asked her lord, ‘is your cheek so pale?’
The slender girl replied, ‘It’s just my nature!’
and turned away and sighed, and let loose the tears that burdened
her eyelids.”

[Page 427] ‘Fool that I was, why didn’t I clasp the lord of my life to my neck?

Why did I turn my face away when he wanted to kiss me? Why did I not see? Why did I not speak?’ So, when love is firstawakened,a girl is filled with remorse as she thinks of her childishshyness.” 32We cannot devote much more space to the many brief poems of theMiddle Ages, which are so full of charm and skill, and which need acompetent translator to introduce them to the West. In passing, however, wewould quote two stanzas contained in the prose work called “The Deeds ofHarsa”, by the 7th-century writer Bāna ( p. 446ff), which are sung by a bardat dawn to rouse his companions. In our opinion these neglected verses areamong the finest in Indian literature. Ostensibly they describe a greatstallion waking from sleep, but it may be that the poet remembered thecosmic symbolism of the horse in Vedic times ( p. 248), and intended tospeak of the universal in terms of the particular. Bāna had evidentlycarefully studied his subject, which he describes almost anatomically, inwords which have few overtones of meaning; but he succeeds in conveyinghis own deep delight in the horse by subtle alliterative effects, by the heavymetre, which he handles with masterly skill, and by the implicit contrast ofthe tiny piece of chaff in the last line.

“He stretches his hind-leg, and, bending his spine, extends his body upwards.
Curving his neck, he rests his muzzle on his chest, and tosses hisdustgrey mane.The steed, his nostrils ceaselessly quivering with desire of fodder,rises from his bed, gently whinnies, and paws the earth with hishoof.“He bends his back and turns his neck sideways, till his face toucheshis buttock,and then the horse, the curls matted about his ears,rubs with his hoof the red corner of his eye, itching from sleep,his eye, struck by his dewdrop-scattering mane, waving andtossing,his eye, to the point of whose quivering eyelash there clings a tinyfragment of chaff.” 3321[Page 428] Before leaving this style of poetry we should mention theKashmiri Bilhana, of the 11th and 12th centuries, whose “Fifty Stanzas ofthe Thief” ( Caurapañcāśikā), purporting to describe the secret love of abold housebreaker and a princess, are full of intense emotion recollectedwithout tranquillity. Each begins with the words “Even today”.

“Even today I can see her, her slender arms encircling my neck,
my breast held tight against her two breasts,
her playful eyes half-closed in ecstasy,
her dear face drinking mine in a kiss.

“Even today, if this evening I might see my beloved, with eyes like the eyes of a fawn, with the bowls of her breasts the colour of milk, I’d leave the joys of kingship and heaven and final bliss.” 34 In a class of its own is Jayadeva’s “Songs of the Cowherd” ( Gita Govinda), written in Bengal in the 12th century. This is a series of dramatic lyrics intended for singing, and describes the love of Krsna for Rgdha andthe milkmaids ( p. 304f). The poem is still sung at the festivals of theBengali Vaisnavite sects, but though it begins with a beautiful invocation tothe ten incarnations of Visnu its inspiration to the Western mind seemsrather erotic than religious. Unlike almost all other classical Sanskrit poetryJayadeva’s lyrics are rhymed, and look forward to the verse forms ofvernacular literature. Each commences with an introductory stanza in one ofthe more usual Sanskrit metres, and the final stanza of each introduces thepoet’s name. The verses which we translate describe Krsna’s longings whenseparated from his beloved Rādhā. “The foe of Madhu” ( a demon killed byKrsna) and Hari are epithets of the god.

‘Here I am dwelling. Go now to Rādhā,console her with my message, and bring her to me.’Thus the foe of Madhu commissioned her friend,who went in person, and spoke to Rādhā thus:‘When the breeze blows from the Southern Mountains,and brings the Love-god with it,when masses of flowers burst forthto rend the hearts of parted lovers,he is grieved at separation from you, decked with his forest garland.

‘Even the cool-rayed moon inflames him,
he is as if dead.

Struck by the arrows of love
he complains most wretchedly.

He is grieved …
[Page 429] ‘When the swarming bees are murmuring
he closes fast his ears.

His heart is clenched by parting,
he spends his nights in fever.

He is grieved. …
‘He dwells in the depths of the forest,
he has left his lovely home.

He tosses in sleep on the earth
and much he murmurs your name.

He is grieved. …’
“When the poet Jayadeva sings,
through this pious description
of the deeds of the parted lover,
may Hari arise in hearts full of zeal.

He is grieved at separation from you, decked with his forest
garland.” 3522

## Narrative Poetry
As well as various smaller collections there exists in various recensions alarge series of popular stories, the Brhatkathā ( “Great Story” ), boxed onewithin the other in the manner of “The Thousand and One Nights”. Themost famous of these versions is Somadeva’s “Ocean of Story” ( Kathā-sarit-sāgara), written in the 1 th century in easy but polished verse. Thestories are told with comparative simplicity and directness, and with manytouches of humour and pathos. We quote from the tale of the thief and themerchant’s daughter. A wealthy merchant, Ratnadatta, has no sons, and hisonly daughter, Ratnavati, much loved and pampered by her father, refusesto marry, despite the pleading of her parents. Meanwhile a desperate thiefhas been captured by the king, and is led through the streets to execution by
impalement.

“To the beat of the drum the thief was led
to the place of execution,
and the merchant’s daughter Ratnavati
sat on the terrace and watched him.

He was gravely wounded and covered with dust,
but as soon as she saw him she was smitten with love.

[Page 430] “Then she went to her father Ratnadatta, and said:
‘This man they are leading to his death
I have chosen for my lord!

Father, you must save him from the king,
or I will die with him!’
And when he heard, her father said:
‘What is this you say, my child?

You’ve refused the finest suitors,
the images of the Love-god!

How can you now desire
a wretched master-thief?’
“But though he reproached her thus
she was firm in her resolve,
so he sped to the king and begged
that the thief might be saved from the stake.

In return he offered
the whole of his great fortune,
but the king would not yield the thief
for ten million pieces of gold,
for he had robbed the whole city,
and was brought to the stake to repay with his life.

“Her father came home in despair,
and the merchant’s daughter
determined to follow
the thief in his death.

Though her family tried to restrain her
she bathed,
and mounted a litter, and went
to the place of impalement,
while her father, her mother and her people
followed her weeping.

“The executioners placed
the thief on the stake,
and, as his life ebbed away,
he saw her come with her people.

He heard the onlookers speaking
of all that had happened,
For a moment he wept, and then,
smiling a little, he died.

At her order they lifted the corpsefrom the stake, and took it away,and with it the worthy merchant’s daughtermounted the pyre.”3623[Page 431] The modern European reader would find this a conclusiveending to a tale of old, unhappy, far-off things; but to the Indian of medievaltimes such an ending would have been quite unsatisfactory, so a deus exmachina was brought in in the form of the god Śiva, who was so impressedby the girl’s love and faithfulness that he restored the corpse of the deadthief to life. He reformed his ways and became the king’s general, and thetwo were married and lived happily ever after.

In the category of narrative poems we must include Kalhana’s greatchronicle of Kashmīr “The River of Kings” ( p. 44), and several othermedieval works of comparatively small literary value. Midway between thepurely narrative poem and the courtly “epic” are a number of historicalworks partly descriptive, partly panegyric, and partly sober history. Themost famous of these is “The Deeds of Harsa”, by Bana, written in ornatepoetic prose, which is discussed below ( p. 447ff). Of some literary merit is“The Deeds of Vikramānka” ( Vikramānkadevacarita), of Bilhana ( p. 428),dealing with the life and adventures of the great Calukya emperorVikramaditya VI ( c. 1075–1125). Another example of this type is theRāmacarita, already mentioned. Yet another is the work of a Jaina monk,Nayacandra Sūri, the Hammīra-mahākāvya, which is among the latestimportant works of Sanskrit literature. This beautiful but little known poemdeals with the life of Hammīra, the last of the dynasty of the Cahamanas,who was defeated and killed by the Delhi sultan Alauddīn Khaljī in 1301,after a long siege of his capital Ranasthambhapura ( in the vernacular,Ranthambhor). As Hammīra was slain with all his followers the poet wasforced by his theme somewhat to flout convention, but he managed to retaina semblance of the happy ending demanded by tradition by concluding hiswork with a description of the entry of Hammīra and his followers intoheaven. Much of the poem, though not without beauty, is irrelevant to the main theme, but the description of the king’s last days is direct and forceful.

Towards the end of the poem Nayacandra introduces a remarkable episode. We cannot say whether he consciously intended the beautiful dancer who died so tragically as a symbol of the courtly culture which fell to the invader, but it is thus that the passage, occurring so portentously just before Hammlra’s death, strikes the reader. In the course of the siege atemporary truce has been arranged, and the Rajputs are making the most ofit. On the battlements a musical entertainment is taking place, andHammīra’s favourite dancer, Radhādevī, is performing for the king and hiscourtiers. A long bowshot away, on the other side of the moat, sits thesultan, also watching the dance with interest. He is referred to in the poemas the Lord of the [Page 432] Śakas, a term at this time applied to all theinvaders of the North-West. The first part of our extract is exceedinglyflorid, and full of untranslatable puns, but the style suddenly becomessimple and terse when the episode moves to its climax.

“In time the drummers beat their drums, the lutanists plucked their
lutes,
the flautists blew their flutes.

Their voices in tune with the shrill flutes, the singerssang the glory and fame of the brave Hammira …Then, the vine of her body entrancing her lovers,awakening passion with the glance of her half-closed eyes,to delight the hearts of the courtiers,came Rādhadevī the dancer, arrayed for the dance.

“The quivering buds of her fingers moved in the dance
like tendrils of a vine, thrilling with passion. …
As the tips of her fingers bent, as though in a circle,
with her grace and delicate beauty all other girls seemed her slaves.

The moon, in the guise of the ring that trembled from the tip of her ear,said: ‘Your face is my likeness, the delusion even of sages!’And as she danced she stirred the hearts of the young men watchingthehearts which lay like motes of camphor under her feet. …With her gestures the necklace trembled on the tips of her breastslike a lotus twined in the beak of a swan.When her body bent back like a bow in the dancelike a bowstring the braid of her hair stretched down to her heel …“And as she danced, at every beat of the rhythm,she turned her back on the Saka king below.

“Then in fury of soul the Lord of the Sakas spoke to his
chamberlain:
‘Is there any bowman who can make her his mark?’His brother said:’Sire, there is he whom you formerly threw intoprison,Uddanasimha-he is the only man who can do it!’At once the Saka king had him brought, and struck off his fetters,and arrayed the traitor finely, with double gift of affection.

And thus apparelled he took the bow which none but he could draw,
and the sinner shot her, as a hunter shoots a doe.


“At the stroke of the arrow she fainted and fell in the moat,as lightning falls from heaven.”3724The DramaThe origin of the Indian theatre is still obscure. It is certain, however, thateven in the Vedic period dramatic performances of some kind [Page 433]were given, and passing references in early sources point to the enaction atfestivals of religious legends, perhaps only in dance and mime. Somewriters have found elements in common between the Indian and theclassical Greek theatre. The curtain at the back of thestagewascalledyavanikā, a diminutive form of the name by which the Greeks weregenerally known in India. One play at least, “The Little Clay Cart” ( p. 441),has a superficial resemblancetothelate Greek comedy of the school ofMenander. We cannot wholly reject the hypothesis that Greek comedies,acted at the courts of the Greco-Bactrian kings ofN.W.India,inspiredunknown Indian poets to develop their own popular stage into a courtly art
form.

The surviving Sanskrit dramas are numerous and varied, ranging from
short one-act playlets to very long plays in ten acts. They were normally performed by troupes of professionals of both sexes, but amateur dramaticswere not wholly unknown, since we have occasional references to kingsand the ladies of the harem performing dramas in the palace. There was noregular theatre, though it has been suggested that one of the caves ofRamgarh ( p. 185) was specially adapted for theatrical performances.

Normally dramas were performed privately or semi-privately in palaces or
the homes of the rich, or were given public showing in temple courts on
days of festival.
A curtain ( yavanikā) divided the stage ( ranga) from the backstage( nepathya), and through this the actors made their entrances. There was nocurtain between stage and auditorium. The drama was performed withoutscenery and with a minimum of properties; the absence of both was madeup for by the highly developed gesture language of the dance, which wehave discussed elsewhere ( p. 385). Every part of the body was used to helptell the story, and the welltrained audience recognized from conventionalmovements of hands, limbs and features that the king was riding in hischariot, or that the heroine was caressing her pet fawn. The splendid attireof the actors was regulated by convention, so that heroes, heroines, gods,demons, villains, and so on were immediately recognizable.The drama regularly began with an invocation to one or more of thegods, and a prologue, in which the chief actor and stage manager( sutradhara) humorously discussed with his wife, the chief actress, theoccasion of the performance and the nature of the play to be performed. 25The main dialogue of the play was in prose, but this was freely interspersedwith verses, which were usually declaimed or intoned, but not sung. In thisancient Indian taste differed from that of [Page 434] present-day India,which demands many songs in plays and films. The classical unities werenot observed; years in time and a thousand miles in space might divide onescene from the next; but within the act unity of time and place wasdemanded. If in this respect the Indian dramatic convention differed fromthat of classical Europe, it agreed in forbidding the portrayal of acts ofviolence on the stage, though this and other rules were sometimes ignored.The act was often preceded by a prelude ( praveśaka), in which one or twocharacters set the scene, and described what had gone before.As in literature generally, so in the theatre Indian convention allowed notragedy. Tragic and pathetic scenes were common enough, but endings werealmost invariably happy. From the European point of view the insistence onthe happy ending often led to the unnatural forcing of the plot. But if herejected tragedy the ancient Indian playgoer delighted in melodrama andpathos. Though the emotion which the Indian writer sought to arouse wastheoretically a sublimated one ( p. 417), in fact the Sanskrit drama containsso many melodramatic scenes that the emotional Indian audience mustoften have been moved to tears. Noble heroes are led to execution forcrimes they did not commit, declaiming their innocence to their sorrowingwives and children, to be saved from the stake at the last moment. Unhappywives are unjustly expelled from their homes by their husbands. Long-lostchildren are reunited with their parents in the final act. Whatever thetheorists, beginning with Bharata ( p. 382), may have said, the sentiment ofthe Indian drama was warm and living, sometimes a little reminiscent ofthat of more popular English authors of the last century.

Like Greek and Elizabethan dramatists Indian writers usually borrowed
their plots from earlier sources, often adapting them freely in the process.

Legends of the gods and ancient heroes formed an inexhaustible mine ofdramatic material. Other plays were written around popular tales of asecular type. There are also dramas of statecraft, based very freely onstories of historical kings of the past, and light comedies of harem intrigue,wherein the hero, a king, succeeds in pacifying the chief queen, who has sether heart against the promotion of the heroine, a servant girl ( usually aprincess in disguise), to queenly status and her husband’s bed. There arealso allegorical dramas, in which the characters are personified virtues andvices, and there are a few surviving examples of farces. Plays wereclassified by the theorists according to style and length into over adozencategories.The hero ( nāyaka) and heroine ( nāyikā) are inevitable characters in mosttypes of drama, as is the villain ( pratināyaka). An interesting [Page 435]stock character is the vidusaka, who provides comic relief; he is an ugly andmisshapen brāhman, the loyal friend of the hero, but invariably a figure offun. Another stock character, occurring in one or two extant dramas andnoted by the theorists, is the vita, the cultured but rather shallow man of theworld who befriends the hero, and somewhat resembles the parasite ofclassical Greek comedy.
The earliest known dramas to have survived are fragments of plays byAśvaghosa ( p. 415), preserved in manuscripts found in the desert sands ofCentral Asia. The oldest complete plays are probably those attributed toBhasa, which seem to be earlier than those of Kālidasā, though there is nocomplete unanimity of experts on this point. Bhasa’s thirteen survivingplays include several works of great merit, notably “The Vision ofVasavadatta” ( Svapnavasavadatta) and “Yaugandharayana’s Vows“( Pratijfiyaugandhardyana). Bhasa also wrote a number of short dramasbased on epic stories in simple and vigorous style. Nowadays his plays areoften the first introduction of the student of Sanskrit to dramatic literature.

He excelled in portraying the heroic sentiment, and ably individualized his characters. More than once he broke the rules of later dramatic theory by permitting acts of violence on the stage.
As in English literature so in Sanskrit, the greatest poet was also thegreatest dramatist. Three plays of Kālidasā have survived: “Malavika andAgnimitra”, a comedy of harem intrigue, its scene set in the Śunga period;“Urvaśī Won by Valour” ( Vikramorvasi), telling the ancient story of thelove of Purūravas and Urvaśī ( p. 405ff); and “The Recognition ofŚakuntalā” ( Abhijñānaśakuntala). At all times the last has been reckonedKālidasā’s masterpiece, and merits special consideration. The plot is set inthe days of legend, when gods and men were not so far apart as they laterbecame. We give an almost complete translation of the fifth act, with asummary of the rest of the play.

The play opens with King Dusyanta chasing the deer in theneighbourhood of a forest hermitage. He alights from his chariot to payhomage to the chief of the hermits, the sage Kanva. Kanva is not at home,but the king meets his foster-daughter, Śakuntalā, the illegitimate child ofthe nymph Menaka ( p. 317), who runs on to the stage harassed by a bee,and is freed from its attentions by the gallant King. Naturally he falls inlove with her, and with due modesty she shows that she returns hisaffection. The second act shows Dusyanta in the throes of love. He cannotpress his suit in the absence of Sakuntala’s foster-father, so he remains inthe neighbourhood of the hermitage, ostensibly to defend it from wildelephants and demons. In the third act Sakuntala is languid and sick withlove. She confesses her feelings to her two friends, Anasiiya andPriyamvada, who persuade her to [Page 436] write a letter to the King. Asshe is writing, the King, who has heard every thing from a nearby thicket,comes on the scene, and the two friends withdraw. He gives Sakuntala aring, and, by plighting their troth, they are married by the gāndharva rite ( p.

168).

In the fourth act Dusyanta has been recalled to his capital by affairs of state, leaving Sakuntala behind. Kanva is still away. Meanwhile a great and irascible hermit, Durvasas, visits the hermitage, and, as a result of a fancied slight, he curses Sakuntala, saying that she will be forgotten by her husbanduntil he sees the ring he gave her. Meanwhile Kanva returns. He knowsalready of what has happened, and decides to send the now pregnantSakuntala to the King. In a scene of great pathos she takes leave of herfoster-father and her friends, and sets out for the capital in the care of twohermits and an elderly hermit-woman, Gautami. The fifth act shows us thecourt of Dusyanta. Sakuntala, veiled, is ushered in with her attendants. Shereminds the King of their love, and the attendants testify to her words; butthe curse of Durvasas has effaced all memory of her from the King’s mind,and he does not recognize her.

GAUTAMI. Child! Put your modesty on one side a minute and take off your veil. Then His Majesty will recognize you. ( She does so. ) THE KING ( looking at Sakuntala, aside).

This shape of untarnished beauty is offered me.

I ponder, whether or not I really wed her.

I am like a bee in a jasmine wet with the dawn dew-
I cannot now enjoy her, nor can I leave her.

( He remains deep in thought. )
THE DOORKEEPER ( aside). How His Majesty respects the Sacred Law!

Who else would think twice about a beauty so easily come by?

ŚARNGARAVA ( one of the ascetics). Your Majesty, why are you so silent?

THE KING. Hermits, I’ve been racking my brains, but I’ve no recollection
whatever of marrying this lady. How can I accept her, … especially when
she shows such obvious signs of pregnancy?

SAKUNTALA ( aside). His Majesty doubts that we were ever married!

What has become of my high-soaring hopes?

ŚARANGARAVA. So you won’t take her!

The sage indeed deserves your scorn,
for he respects his outraged daughter,
he gives to you the wealth you stole from him,
and treats a robber as an honest man!

SARADVATA ( the other ascetic). That’s enough, Śarigarava! Śakuntala,
we’ve said all we can say, and His Majesty has spoken! Now it’s up to you!

You must say something that will convince him.

ŚAKUNTALĀ ( aside). When his passion has sunk to such depths what’s [Page 437] the good of reminding him of it! The only thing I’m sure of is that I’m to be pitied! ( Aloud. ) Your Majesty! ( Her voice drops to anundertone). Even though you doubt your marriage to me, this isn’t the wayyou ought to receive me. I’m a girl who is naturally open-hearted. Is it rightthat you should make promises to me at the hermitage and then deceive me,and now use such harsh words to throw me aside?

THE KING ( putting his hands to his ears). Heaven forbid!

Why do you try to sully your kin
and bring me to ruin,
as a river dashing against its banks
sullies its water and fells the tree on the shore?

ŚAKUNTALĀ. All right! If you really think I’m another man’s wife I’ll
clear up your doubts by this token!

THE KING. That’s a good idea!

ŚAKUNTALĀ ( feeling her ring-finger). Oh dear! Oh dear!! The ring isn’t on
my finger! ( She looks at Gautamī in distress. )
GAUTAMI. The ring must have slipped off your finger while you were
bathing.

THE KING ( smiling). There’s a well-known saying–“A woman always has
her wits about her”!

ŚAKUNTALĀ. Fate’s against me again! One thing more I want to say.

THE KING. Very well! I’ll listen!

ŚAKUNTALĀ. One day when we were in the bower of creepers you had a
lotus leaf filled with water in your hand.THE KING. I’m listening.ŚAKUNTALĀ. Then my pet fawn Dirghāpanga came up, and you held outthe water and tried to get him to come to you, and said tenderly that heshould have the first drink, but he wouldn’t come near your hand becausehe didn’t know you. So I held him, and he took the water from me, and youlaughed and said, “Everyone trusts his own kind-after all, you’re bothchildren of the forest!”THE KING. Those are the sort of sweet and lying phrases with whichscheming women fool men of the world!GAUTAMI. Good sir, you shouldn’t say such things. This girl wasbrought up in a hermitage, and she knows nothing of deceit.THE KING. Old woman!Eveninbirdsandbeaststhefemale needs no lessons in deceit!How much less she who has the power of reason!Cuckoos, before they take to flight,make sure that other birds will rear their chicks![Page 438] ŚAKUNTALĀ ( angrily). You wretch! You judge me by themeasure of your own heart! Was there ever a bigger hypocrite? You, in yourcloak of righteousness-you’re like a well covered over with grass!THE KING ( aside). Her anger seems quite genuine and makes me havesecond thoughts.She must think my soul is vile in its forgetfulness,and in not acknowledging our secret love.At the knitting of the brows of her eyes red with angerthe bow of the Love-god is snapped in two.( Aloud). Good woman. The movements of King Dusyanta are commonknowledge, and nobody knows anything about this.ŚAKUNTALĀ. So be it! Here am I, turned into a wanton, and all because Itrusted the race of Pūru, and fell into the clutches of a man who had honeyon his tongue and poison in his heart. ( She covers herface with the end ofher robe and weeps. )
ŚĀRĀGARAVA. So you have to suffer for your own folly, when you don’t
keep a check on your impulses.

One should think hard before making love,
especially in secret.

Friendship to those whose hearts we know not
soon turns to hatred.

THE KING. What, do you trust this lady enough to attack me with your
censorious words?

ŚĀRĀGARAVA ( scornfully). You hear things upside down!

The word of one who from her birthhas learnt no guile carries no weight at all,but they who have mastered the science of deceithave power to speak words of authority.THE KING. Honest sir, if for the sake of the argument I admit youraccusation, tell me what good it would do me to deceive her.ŚĀRĀGARAVA. You’d reap your own ruin.THE KING. And surely it’s unbelievable that a king of the line of Pūrushould seek his own ruin?SARADVATA. Śārigarava, what’s the use of arguing with him? We’vecarried out the Teacher’s command, now let’s go home. ( To THE KING. )Here is Your Lordship’s wifeleave her or accept her.It is said that the husband’s powerover the wife is all-embracing.[Page 439] Gautami, let’s go! ( They make for the door. )
ŚAKUNTALĀ. Oh, how I’ve been cheated by this deceiver! You mustn’t
leave me! ( Shefollows them. )
GAUTAMI. ( pausing. ) Look, Śārngarava, my child Sakuntala is following
us and crying pitifully. Oh, what will my little girl do, now that her husband
has cast her off so cruelly?

ŚĀRĀGARAVA ( turning sternly). Wanton, you are too independent!

( Śakuntalā trembles withfear. )
Śārngarava. Śakuntalā
If you are what the king says you are
you are cast off by your family, and your father is nothing to you;
but if you know your vow to be true
even bondage in your husband’s home is good.

You must stay behind, and we must go!

THE KING. Hermit, why do you delude this lady?

The moon awakens the night-flowering lotuses,
and the sun those that flower by day.

The way of the man of self-control
is to have no dealings with the wife of another.

ŚĀRĀGARAVA. When Your Majesty has such a short memory for his past
deeds he does well to be so fearful of sin!

THE KING ( to the Chief Priest).26 I ask you the rights and wrongs of the
matter.

I wonder, am I forgetful,
or has she told me lies?

Shall I abandon my own wife
or sin by touching another’s?

THE CHIEF PRIEST ( thoughtfully). If you ask me, this is what I think
should be done.

THE KING. Command me, Your Honour!

THE CHIEF PRIEST. Let the lady stay in my home until the child is born Ifyou ask why, this is my reason-Long ago the wise men told you that yourfirst son would become a universal emperor. If the son of the hermit’sdaughter bears the tokens of such kingship you should congratulate her andtake her into your harem-otherwise send her back to her father.

THE KING. It shall be as my master pleases.

THE CHIEF PRIEST. Child, follow me!

[Page 440] ŚAKUNTALĀ. O holy Earth, open for me! ( She starts to go, and
leaves with the Chief Priest. The hermits depart. The King, his memoryclouded by the curse, thinks about Sakuntala. )38Soon the Chief Priest returns. As he was leading Sakuntala to his home aheavenly shape appeared and carried her up to heaven. It was her mother,the nymph Menaka, who had come to take her to her true parents’ home forher confinement.

Act six introduces two policemen and a fishermen. He has found a
precious ring in the maw of a fish, and is hauled before the king under the
suspicion of having stolen it. As soon as Dusyanta sees the ring herecognizes it as the one he gave Sakuntala, and his memory returns. ButSakuntala has vanished. For a while the King gives himself up to grief, forhe has lost his wife and he has no heir. Soon he assuages his sorrow inaction, for Matali, the charioteer of Indra, brings him word that his help isneeded in the long war between gods and demons.

The final act takes place several years later on the lower slopes ofheaven, at the hermitage of the divine sage Mārīca. Dusyanta is returningvictorious from battle, when he sees a small boy, nobly wrestling with atame lion cub. He stops his chariot to admire the child’s courage andstrength, and is told that he is Bharata, the son of Sakuntala. The lovers arereunited, and all ends happily.

In many respects “Sakuntala” is comparable to the more idyllic comediesof Shakespeare, and Kanva’s hermitage is surely not far from the Forest ofArden. The plot of the play, like many of Shakespeare’s plots, dependsmuch on happy chances and on the supernatural, which, of course, wasquite acceptable to the audience for which Kālidasā wrote. Its characters,even to the minor ones, are happily delineated individuals. In the passagewe have quoted the two hermits, who play no further part in the action, aresharply differentiated. Śārāgarava is a brave and upright man, fearless in hisdenunciation of wickedness in high places, but rather stern and hard in hisrighteousness. Saradvata, on the other hand, betrays himself in two lines asa moral weakling, anxious to escape from an unpleasant situation as quicklyas possible. Kālidasā makes no pretence to realism, but his dialogue is freshand vigorous. In fact the dialogue of the better Sanskrit plays generallyseems based on vernacular, and is full of idiomatic expressions. Indianplaygoers did not demand the conflict of feelings and emotions which is thechief substance of serious European drama, but Kālidasā was quite capableof portraying such conflict effectively. His beauties and merits are tarnishedby any translation, but few who can read him in the original would doubtthat, both as poet and dramatist, he was one of the great men of the world.

PLATE LXXXII
[Page 441] There were many other dramatists, of whom we can only mention a few. Śūdraka, probably Kālidasā’s approximate contemporary, has left only one play “The Little Clay Cart” ( Mrcchakatika). This is the most realistic of Indian dramas, unravelling a complicated story, rich inhumour and pathos and crowded with action, of the love of a poor brāhman,Carudatta, for the virtuous courtezan Vasantasena; this story is interwovenwith one of political intrigue, leading up to the overthrow of the wickedking Palaka, and the play contains a vivid trial scene, after which the hero issaved from execution at the last moment. It is notable for its realisticdepiction of city life, and for its host of minor characters, all of whom aredrawn with skill and individuality. It has more than once been performed intranslation on the European stage, and, to a Western audience, is certainlythe most easily appreciated of Indian plays.

Visakhadatta ( 16th century) was the dramatist of politics. His onlycomplete surviving play, “The Minister’s Signet Ring “( Mudrdrāksasa),deals with the schemes of the wily Canakya ( p. 50) to foil the plots ofRaksasa, the minister of the last of the Nandas, and to place CandraguptaMaurya firmly on the throne. The plot is exceedingly complicated, but isworked out with great skill, and the play is beautifully constructed to leadup, like “The Little Clay Cart”, to a pathetic scene where one of the chiefcharacters is saved from death by impalement at the last moment. Anotherplay by Visakhadatta, “The Queen and Candra Gupta” ( Devicandragupta),purporting to tell the story of the rise to power of Candra Gupta II ( p. 65),exists only in fragments.

Three plays are ascribed to the great king Harsa ( p. 68f), though they maybe the work of a “ghost writer”. They are “Ratnavali”, “Priyadarāikī”, and“The Joy of the Serpents “( Nāgānanda). The first two, named after theirheroines, are charming harem comedies, while the last is a play of religiouspurport, telling of prince Jīmūitavahāna, who gives his own body to put astop to the sacrifice of serpents to the divine Garuda ( p. 300).

With Harsa we may link his royal contemporary, the Pallava king Mahendravikramavarman, who has left a one-act play “The Sport of the Drunkards “( Mattavilasa). It treats of a drunken Saivite ascetic, who loses the skull which he uses as a begging bowl, and accuses a Buddhist monk ofstealing it. After much satirical dialogue, in which other dissolute asceticsof various persuasions and both sexes are involved, it is found that the skullhas been stolen by a dog. This little farce, though slight, throws a flood oflight on the life of the times and is full of Rabelaisian humour.

Second only to Kālidasā in the esteem of the critics was Bhavabhāti, [Page 442] who lived at Kānyakubjain the early 8th century. Three of his plays survive-“Mālatī and Mādhava”, “The Deeds of the Great Hero” ( Mahdviracarita), and “The Later Deeds of Rama” ( UttaraRāmacarita).

The first is a love story with a pseudo-realistic background, full of incident of an exciting or horrific type, in which the heroine is more than once rescued from death, while the two latter plays tell the story of Rāma. ByWestern standards as a dramatist Bhavabhūti falls short of those we havementioned earlier. His plots are weakly constructed and his characters lackindividuality. His greatness rests on his deep understanding of sorrow; inhis treatment of the pathetic and the terrible he perhaps excels Kālidasā.

After Bhavabhūti the quality of Sanskrit drama declined. Playwrights ofsome merit, such as Bhatta Nārāyana ( ? 8th century), Murāri ( early 9thcentury), Rājaśekhara ( 9th-loth centuries), and Krsnamiśra ( 11th century),continued to write dramas, but their work grew more and more literary, andwas evidently often rather intended for reading than for performance. Wehave records of the occasional production of Sanskrit plays until theMuslim invasion, after which the Sanskrit theatrical tradition, though notforgotten, became a thing of the past.

## Sanskrit Prose Literature
The earliest surviving prose stories are a few narrative episodes in the brāhmanas ( p. 405f), followed by the Pali Jatakas ( p. 454f). In the Gupta period, however, there developed a style of ornate prose narrative, which was very different from the simple Pali stories, and was classed as kavya.

The chief writers in this genre were Dandin, Subandhu and Bana, all of whom lived in the late 6th and early 7th centuries.

Dandin’s “Tales of the Ten Princes” ( DaśaKumāracarita) is a collectionof exciting and ingenious stories, held together by a framing narrative andall interwoven with great skill. The prose is comparatively simple. Longcompounds are numerous, but the inordinately lengthy sentences of Bānaare not to be found. The stories are secular, often humorous, and sometimesamoral, while the characters are well delineated. Some of the interest of the“Ten Princes “lies in its comparative realism, for in their adventures the tenheroes come in contact with merchants and thieves, princesses andprostitutes, peasants and wild hillmen. Few works of Indian literature tell usso much about low life.

As examples of Dandin’s style we give two little stories which arecontained within the larger tales, and are intended to show contrastingaspects of the character of the fair sex. The styles are sharply [Page 443]differentiated to fit the themes; the grisly story of Dhūminī is told in crispshort sentences with great economy of detail, while in the domestic idyll ofGomini Dandin lingers lovingly on his words, and describes the charmingscene in leisurely periods.

“There is a country called Trigarta, where there lived three householders, who had accumulated a great fortune. They were brothers, called Dhanaka, Dhanyaka and Dhanyaka. In those days Indra gave no rain for twelve years.

The corn withered, plants were barren, trees bore no fruit, and the cloudswere impotent; water courses dried up, ponds became mere mudholes, andthe springs ceased to flow. Bulbs, roots and fruit became scarce, folk-taleswere forgotten, and all festive merrymaking ceased. Robber bandsmultiplied, and people ate one another’s flesh. Human skulls, white ascranes,rolled on the ground. Flocks of thirsty crows flew hither and thither.Villages, cities, whole districts, were deserted.“The three householders first ate their store of grain and then one by onetheir goats, their sheep, their buffaloes, their cows, their maidservants, theirmenservants, their children, and the wives of the eldest and the middlebrother. Finally they decided that next day they would eat Dhūminī, thewife of the youngest; but the youngest brother, Dhanyaka, could not bringhimself to eat his darling, so that night he stole away withher.“When she grew weary he carried her, until they came to a forest … andthey walked on through it until at last they came upon a man who waswrithing on the ground, with his hands, feet, ears and nose cut off. Hecompassionately supported this man too on his shoulder, and for a long timethe three dwelt in a hut which he painstakingly built of leaves in a corner ofthe forest which abounded in edible bulbs, roots and game. He healed theman’s wounds with almond and sesamum oil, and fed him with a full shareof his own meat and vegetables.

“One day when the man had quite recovered and was restored to health,
when Dhanyaka had gone hunting, Dhūminī approached the man withdesire for pleasure, and though he upbraided her she compelled him tosatisfy her. When her husband came back and asked for water she said,‘Draw it from the well yourself, I’ve got a splitting headache’, and tossedhim the bucket and rope. As he was drawing water from the well she creptup suddenly behind him and pushed him in.

“Supporting the cripple on her shoulder she wandered from land to land,
and gained the reputation of a devoted wife, and was much honoured.

Finally she settled in Avanti, and lived in great affluence, thanks to thegenerosity of the king. One day she heard that her husband had beenrescued from the well by a band of thirsty merchants, and was now roamingabout the land of Avanti, begging his food. So Dhūminī declared to theunwitting king that he was the villain who had crippled her husband, and hecondemned the good man to death by torture.“As Dhanyaka was being led to execution, knowing that his appointedtime had not yet come, he boldly said to the officer in charge, ‘If the beggar[Page 444] I’m supposed to have crippled is ready to condemn me I deservemy punishment!’ The officer thought that no harm could come of testing[his words, so he sent for the cripple]. As soon as the cripple was broughtand saw Dhanyaka his eyes filled with tears. He fell at the good man’s feet,and, being a man of noble mind, he told of Dhanyaka’s kindness and thefalse Dhūmini’s wickedness. The enraged king had the wicked woman’sface disfigured, and made her serve as a cook in his kennels, while hebestowed great favour on Dhanyaka. And that is why I say that women arehardhearted.”“In the land of the Dravidians is a city called Kāñcī. Therein dwelt thevery wealthy son of a merchant, by name ŚaktiKumāra. When he wasnearly eighteen he thought: ‘There’s no pleasure in living without a wife orwith one of bad character. Now how can I find a really good one?’ So,dubious of his chance of finding wedded bliss with a woman taken at theword of others, he became a fortune-teller, and roamed the land with ameasure of unhusked rice tied in the skirts of his robe; and parents, takinghim for an interpreter of birthmarks, showed their daughters to him.

Whenever he saw a girl of his own class, whatever her birthmarks, he
would say to her: ‘My dear girl, can you cook me a good meal from this
measure of rice?’ And so, ridiculed and rejected, he wandered from house
to house.

“One day in the land of the Śibis, in a city on the banks of the Kāverī, he examined a girl who was shown to him by her nurse. She wore little jewellery, for her parents had spent their fortune, and had nothing left buttheir dilapidated mansion. As soon as he set eyes on her he thought: ‘Thisgirl is shapely and smooth in all her members. Not one limb is too fat or toothin, too short or too long. Her fingers are pink; her hands are marked withauspicious lines-the barleycorn, the fish, the lotus and the vase; her anklesare shapely; her feet are plump and the veins are not prominent; her thighscurve smoothly; her knees can barely be seen, for they merge into herrounded thighs; her buttocks are dimpled and round as chariot wheels; hernavel is small, flat and deep; her stomach is adorned with three lines; thenipples stand out from her large breasts, which cover her whole chest; herpalms are marked with signs which promise corn, wealth and sons; her nailsare smooth and polished like jewels; her fingers are straight and taperingand pink; her arms curve sweetly from the shoulder, and are smoothlyjointed; her slender neck is curved like a conch-shell; her lips are roundedand of even red; her pretty chin does not recede; her cheeks are round, fulland firm; her eyebrows do not join above her nose, and are curved, dark andeven; her nose is like a half-blown sesamum flower; her wide eyes are largeand gentle and flash with three colours, black, white and brown; her brow isfair as the new moon; her curls are lovely as a mine of sapphires; her longears are adorned doubly, with earrings and charming lotuses, hanginglimply; her abundant hair is not brown, even at the tips, 27 but long, smooth,glossy and fragrant. The character of such a girl cannot but correspond to[Page 445] her appearance, and my heart is fixed upon her, so I’ll test herand marry her. For one regret after another is sure to fall on the heads ofpeople who don’t take precautions!’ So, looking at her affectionately, hesaid, ‘Dear girl, can you cook a good meal for me with this measure ofrice?’“Then the girl glanced at her old servant, who took the measure of ricefrom his hand and seated him on the veranda, which had been wellsprinkled and swept, giving him water to cool his feet. Meanwhile the girlbruised the fragrant rice, dried it a little at a time in the sun, turned itrepeatedly, and beat it with a hollow cane on a firm flat spot, very gently, soas to separate the grain without crushing the husk. Then she said to thenurse, ‘Mother, goldsmiths can make good use of these husks for polishingjewellery. Take them, and, with the coppers you get for them, buy somefirewood, not too green and not too dry, a small cooking pot, and twoearthen dishes. ‘28“When this was done she put the grains of rice in a shallowwidemouthed, round-bellied mortar, and took a long and heavy pestle ofacaciawood, its head shod with a plate of iron. … With skill and grace sheexerted her arms, as the grains jumped up and down in the mortar.

Repeatedly she stirred them and pressed them down with her fingers; then
she shook the grains in a winnowing basket to remove the beard, rinsed
them several times, worshipped the hearth, and placed them in water which had been five times brought to the boil. When the rice softened, bubbledand swelled, she drew the embers of the fire together, put a lid on thecooking pot, and strained off the gruel. Then she patted the rice with a ladleand scooped it out a little at a time; and when she found that it wasthoroughly cooked she put the cooking pot on one side, mouth downward.
Next she damped down those sticks which were not burnt through, andwhen the fire was quite out she sent them to the dealers to be sold ascharcoal, saying, ‘With the coppersthatyouget for them, buy as much asyou can of green vegetables, ghee, curds, sesamum oil, myrobalans andtamarind.’“When this was done she offered him a few savouries. Next she put therice-gruel in a new dish immersed in damp sand, and cooled it with the softbreeze of a palm-leaf fan. She added a little salt, and flavoured it with thescent of the embers; she ground the myrobalans to a smooth powder, untilthey smelt like a lotus; and then, by the lips of the nurse, she invited him totake a bath. This he did, and when she too had bathed she gave him oil andmyrobalans [as an unguent].

“After he had bathed he sat on a bench in the paved courtyard, which had
been thoroughly sprinkled and swept. She stirred the gruel in the two
dishes, which she set before him on a piece of pale green plantain leaf, cutfrom a tree in the courtyard. He drank it and felt rested and happy, relaxedin every limb. Next she gave him two ladlefuls of the boiled rice, servedwith a little ghee and condiments. She served the rest of the rice [Page 446]with curds, three spices [mace, cardamom and cinnamon], and fragrant andrefreshing buttermilk and gruel. He enjoyed the meal to the last mouthful.

“When he asked for a drink she poured him water in a steady streamfrom the spout of a new pitcher-it was fragrant with incense, and smelt offresh trumpet-flowers and the perfume of full-blown lotuses. He put thebowl to his lips, and his eyelashes sparkled with rosy drops as cool as snow;his ears delighted in the sound of the trickling water; his rough cheeksthrilled and tingled at its pleasant contact; his nostrils opened wide at itssweet fragrance; and his tongue delighted in its lovely flavour, as he drankthe pure water in great gulps. Then, at his nod, the girl gave him amouthwash in another bowl. The old woman took away the remains of hismeal, and he slept awhile in his ragged cloak, on the pavement plasteredwith fresh cowdung.

“Wholly pleased with the girl, he married her with due rites, and took her
home. Later he neglected her awhile and took a mistress, but the wife
treated her as a dear friend. She served her husband indefatigably, as shewould a god, and never neglected her household duties; and she won theloyalty of her servants by her great kindness. In the end her husband was soenslaved by her goodness that he put the whole household in her charge,made her sole mistress of his life and person, and enjoyed the three aims oflife-virtue, wealth and love. So I maintain that virtuous wives make theirlords happy and virtuous.”39Subandhu, the next of the three great prose writers, is known only fromone work, called after its heroine Vdsavadattd, which tells of thevicissitudes of her love for the prince Kandarpaketu. Unlike Dandin,Subandhu was quite unable to tell a story, and had no sense of character.

His merits lie in his ornate descriptions and his mastery of language, and his
work consists of a series of descriptive tableaux, linked by a thin thread ofnarrative, each long description told in a single sentence which covers twoor more pages of type. The work abounds in flowers of speech of all kinds-puns, doubles entendres, alliterations and assonances, and is a typicalexample of the Gauda ( Bengali) style of literary composition, asdistinguished from the simpler Vaidarbha ( Berar) style, with shorter, lessinvolved sentences, employed by Kālidasā and Dandin. It cannot beenjoyed in translation and its merits are only apparent in the framework ofits own standards. Of European literature perhaps Lily’s Euphues andsimilar late Renaissance prose works most closely approach it in style andspirit.
Bana’s style is similar to that of Subandhu, but his work is much morevital and congenial to Western taste. Not only do his elaborate descriptionsshow accurate and close observation, but throughout his two works, the“Deeds of Harsa” ( Harsacarita) and Kddambarn, the personality of theauthor breaks through. In the former [Page 447] work, moreover, he givesus a fragment of autobiography unparalleled in Sanskrit literature. Bāna wasborn of a well-to-do brahman family, and his mother died in his earlychildhood. At the age of fourteen he lost his father also, and, after a periodof mourning, he began to sow his wild oats. He names with evidentaffection the bosom friends of his dissolute youth, which was spent in
wandering from city to city among the intellectual bohemians of the time.

His circle was remarkably wide, including ascetics of various sects, bothorthodox and otherwise, literary men, actors, musicians, entertainers,doctors, and even humble people of low caste. The list of Bana’s friends,mentioned in no special order, is in itself sufficient to show how lightly therules of caste weighed on the educated man. The author gives us no detailsof his adventures, but it would seem that in the course of them he wasreceived at the court of Harsa, whom he offended in some way. Later hereturned for a while to his home, and resumed the peaceful life of a countrybrahman; but soon a message came from Harsa, demanding his attendanceat court. He was at first received coldly, but afterwards was restored tofavour.

Though religiously minded, Bāna seems throughout his life to have
transcended the bounds of orthodoxy and to have retained some of theunconventionality of his wild youth. He was not afraid to put forwardopinions which might have made him unpopular with his royal patron —forinstance he condemned the doctrine of royal divinity as gross sycophancy,and attacked the Macchiavellian system of statecraft associated with thename of Kautilya as immoral and inhuman. Here and there in his workoccur passages which show implicit sympathy with the poor and humble-asentiment rarely found in ancient Indian literature-and he is a master ofexact observation. For all the floweriness of his style Bāna’s outlook hasmore in common with that of the 20th century than that of any other earlyIndian writer.
Of his two works the “Deeds of Harsa” tells of the events leading up toHarsa’s rise to power with general authenticity, but with some evidentexaggeration, and with a lack of circumstantial detail which the historianfinds irritating. The work was apparently unfinished, since when itconcludes the hero’s destiny is still somewhat in doubt. Kādambarī isperhaps a conscious and successful attempt to improve on Subandhu’sVāsavadattā. The story is a romance, told in a series of narrated episodeswhich link together to build upacomplicatedplot.This work also wasunfinished, and was completed by the author’s son, whose prentice hand isquite evident.As an example of Bāna’sstylewegiveasomewhatabridged and adaptedversion of his description of Harsa’s army striking camp to march againsthis enemies. In the original the whole consists of a [Page 448] singlesentence, the basisof which is the phrase “the royal court was filled withchieftains” near the end of the passage. The separate sentences or clauses ofour translation are single compound words in the original.‘“Then it was time to go. The drums rattled, the kettledrums beatjoyfully, the trumpets blared, the horns blew, the conches sounded. Bydegrees the hubbub of the camp grew louder. Officers busily roused theKing’s courtiers. The sky shook with the din of fast-hammering mallets anddrumsticks. The generals assembled the ranks of the subordinate officers.The darkness of the night was broken by the glare of a thousand torcheswhich the people lighted. Lovers were aroused by the tramping feet of thewomen who kept watch. The harsh shouts of the elephant-marshalsdispelled the slumber of their drowsy riders as awakened elephants left theirstables.

“Squadrons of horses woke from sleep and shook their manes. The camp resounded loudly as spades dug up the tent-pegs, and the tethering chains of elephants clinked as their stakes were pulled up. … As the foragers released the elephants all space was filled with the clanking of their fetters. Leather bags full to bursting were placed on their dusty backs, which had been rubbed down with tufts of hay. Servants rolled up the canvasses andawnings of tents and pavilions, and the bundles of tent-pegs were storedaway in bulging leather sacks. Store-keepers assembled their stores, andmany elephant-drivers loaded them. The dwellings of the vassals werecluttered with cups and cooking utensils, which were lifted on to the backsof elephants, steadied by their riders. The soldiers laughed as the fatstrumpets were dragged away by force, resisting vigorously with feet andhands. The many mighty and savage elephants trumpeted, as the girthbandsof their bright harness were tightened, and restricted the freedom of theirlimbs. …. Camels neighed in annoyance as sacks were loaded on their
backs.

“The wives of highborn gentlemen were visited in their carriages by gobetweens sent by princes. Elephant-captains, who had forgotten that itwas time to go, looked for their servants. The splendid horses of the King’sfavourites were led by footmen wealthy with their masters’ gifts. Troops ofhandsome warriors adorned their bodies with circles of unguent, scentedwith camphor. The harness of the marshals’ horses was hung with bags ofsalted peas, little bells, and whistles. 29 Monkeys sat among the troops ofhorses, as the grooms straightened their tangled reins. Stablemen draggedsacks of musty fodder for the horses’ morning meal. The calls of thegrasscutters grew louder and louder. There was uproar in the stables asyounghorses strained and reared and swerved at the confusion of starting.Girls hurried at the call of the riders of the harnessed horses with unguentsfor their faces. As the elephants and horses set out the poor folk of the[Page 449] neighbourhood ran up to loot the remains of the heaped grain.
Donkeys plodded on together, loaded with piles of clothing. The trampledroads were filled with carts with creaking wheels. Oxen were loaded withequipment which would suddenly fall off. The strong oxen, first to bedriven away, lagged behind, drawn by the grass which grew by theroadside.

“In front went the field-kitchens of the chief vassals. Standard bearers led the ranks. As the troops left their small huts hundreds of their friends came out to meet them. The feet of the elephants trampled the hovels by the roadside, and the people came out and threw clods at their keepers, who called on the bystanders to witness their assaults. Poor families ran fromtheir wrecked and ruined huts. Oxen, bearing the wealth of unfortunatemerchants, fled from the hubbub. Clearing a path through the crowd withthe glare of their torches, runners led the way for the elephants bearing thewomen of the harem. Horsemen shouted to the dogs running behind them.

The veterans praised the tall Tangana horses, which trotted so smoothly and quickly that they made travelling a pleasure. Unhappy Southerners upbraided their fallen mules. The whole world was swallowed in dust.

“The royal court was filled with chieftains who had come from everyquarter, riding on cow-elephants, whose drivers bore bows adorned withstripes of gold-leaf. Seated within [the howdahs] their batmen carried theirswords. Their betel-bearers fanned them with flywhisks. The soldiers seatedin the rear bore bundles of javelins in cases. The trappings [of theelephants] bristled with curved sabres and gilded arrows. … The thighs [ofthe chieftains] were clothed in fine-patterned silk, but their legs werecovered with mud-stained trousers. … Their tunics were decked with darkjewels, which glistened against their bodies. They wore Chinese cuirasses,doublets adorned with bright clusters of pearls. … and scarves as bright as aparrot’s wing. All the ends of the earth were filled with knights andwarriors, who hurried on with tossing shields and plumes. The ends ofheaven were loud with the jingling golden ornaments on the harness of theprancing Kamboja steeds in their hundreds. The ear was deafened by theharsh booming of hundreds of large kettledrums, mercilessly beaten. Theroll was called. With upturned faces the footmen awaited the order tomarch.” 40After Bāna similar prose romances were often written, as well as storiesin mixed prose and verse ( campū), but none is of much literary importance,and most are derivative, pedantic and dull.

Another branch of prose narrative literature was the fable, which we meetfirst in the Pāli Jātakas. These cheerful little stories, whose characters areoften talking animals, have much in common with the fables popular inancient Greece, and there has been some discussion on the question ofinfluence. Direct borrowing is unlikely, though it may be that some of thetales were derived from a common source in the ancient Middle East.

Whatever the origin of these stories Indian folklore did influence theliterature of the West, for one of the most [Page 450] famous Indiancollections of fables, the Paicatantra, was translated into Pahlavl, or MiddlePersian, in the 6th century. Thence it was translated into Syriac, and thenceagain, in the 8th century, into Arabic. In various versions it appeared in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and found its way all over Europe. The earliestEnglish version is that of Sir Thomas North, called “The MorallPhilosophie of Doni” after the name of the translator of the Italian version,which North used. This appeared in 1570, and was the earliest work ofIndian literature ( much garbled by successive translations) to be publishedin English. The fables of La Fontaine are admittedly based on “Pilpay”, theform in which Vidyapati, the title of the Indian sage who is said to havenarrated the stories, reached Europe. As well as the fables of La Fontainethe stories of Reynard the Fox, popular in the folk literature of many partsof Europe and given finished form by Goethe, owe much to this source.

Other Indian tales, including several from the Brhatkatha ( p. 429), found their way westwards, and the “Arabian Nights” owes several of its stories and themes to India, including some of the marvels met by Sindbad the Sailor.

The Pañcatantra ( “Five Treatises” ) is in theory a book of instruction inniti, or the conduct of one’s affairs, especially intended for kings andstatesmen. The little stories are contained in a framing narrative which tellshow a king was distressed at the evil and stupidity of his sons, and entrustedthem to a sage who reformed them in six months by telling them a series offables. The book exists in several versions of varying length and merit, mostly in prose, but with many verses of a gnomic type. The most famousof these versions is Narayana’s Hitopadeśa ( ” Salutary Instruction” ),composed in Bengal in the 12th century. The work was intended as a“reader” for students of Sanskrit, and serves that purpose well down to thepresent day. Never was a school textbook better written. The author wascompelled by his purpose to avoid the euphuisms and pedantries whichaffected most of the literature of his time, and he wrote lucidly and wittily,liberally including memorably terse gnomic stanzas. Ethically many of thestories are dubious, for they encourage caution and self-interest rather thanaltruism. The two stories we quote are boxed within others.

‘It is said:
He who takes a well-spoken knave
to be a man of his own stamp
is fooled by rogues, like the brahman
who was robbed of his goat.’
‘How did that happen?’ asked the King.

[Page 451] ‘In the forest of Gautama,’ said Meghavarna, ‘there lived a brahman famous for his sacrifices. Once he went to a village and bought a goat for sacrifice, and as he was carrying it home on his shoulder he wasseen by three rogues. “If we could find a way to get that goat,” they said tothemselves, “it would be a fine trick!” So they stationed themselves eachunder a tree about a krośa apart. As the brāhman passed by, the first roguesaid, “Why, brāhman, that’s a dog you’re carrying on your back!” “It’s not adog,” replied the brahman,” it’s a goat for sacrifice!”‘Then the next rogue addressed him with the same words. This time thebrāhman put the goat on the ground and looked at it hard, and again slung itover his shoulder and went on, his mind wavering like a swing; forThe words of rogues make even the mind of a good man waver.

If he trusts them he dies like Pretty-ears.’
‘How did that happen?’ asked the King.

‘In a forest land,’ he said,’ there lived a lion named Madotkata, who had three servants, a crow, a tiger and a jackal. Once as the three were out walking they met a camel, and they asked him whence he came, and whether he had fallen out of a caravan. He told them his story, and they took him back and handed him over to the lion, who gave him his freedom and security; and he took the name of Pretty-ears.

‘Later the lion was taken ill, and there was heavy rain and they were very distressed for want of food. So they agreed so to arrange matters that their lord should kill Pretty-ears. “Of what other use,” they said to themselves, “is that eater of thorns to us?” “But how can we manage it,”said the tiger, “when our master has given him a pledge of security and hashim in his favour?” “At a time like this,” said the crow, “when the master isreduced to skin and bone, he won’t scruple at a sin; forA woman torn by hunger will abandon her child.

A snake torn by hunger will eat its own eggs.

What evil will a hungry man not do?

Lean men are always pitiless!

And, what is more,
A drunkard, an imbecile, a lunatic,
a man tired out, an angry man, a hungry man,
a greedy man, a frightened man, a hasty man,
or a man in love never do the right thing.”
‘After thus deliberating they all went to the lion. “Have you found
anything to eat?” the lion asked. “We’ve done our best,” they replied, “but
we haven’t found a thing!” “Well,” said the lion, “how are we to keep alive
now?” “Sire,” said the crow, “if we don’t get our natural food we’ll all
surely die.” “And what,” asked the lion, “is our natural food?” “Pretty-
ears!” whispered the crow in the lion’s ear.

[Page 452] ‘The lion touched the earth and covered his ears in horror.

“We’ve given him a pledge of security,” he said, “and we must stand by it.

How can we eat him? For
Not gifts of land nor gifts of gold,
nor gifts of cattle nor gifts of food
are said to be the greatest gift.

Of all gifts greatest is the gift of safety.

Moreover
The merit of the horse-sacrifice,
the fulfilment of all desires,
comes to the man who protects
those who take refuge with him.”
‘“True!” said the crow. “Our lord must not kill him. But there’s no
reason why we shouldn’t so arrange things that he offers his body
voluntarily.” At this the lion kept silence. So when a suitable occasion
offered the crow found a pretext to bring them all into the lion’s presence.

“Sire,” he said, “however hard we try we can find no food. Your Majesty is
weak from days of fasting. So now make a meal of my flesh, for
All subjects are dependent on their lord.

Only well-rooted trees bear fruit,
and only when the king is strong
do men’s works prosper.”
“‘“I’d rather die myself than do such a thing!” said the lion.

“‘Then the jackal made the same offer. “Never!” the lion replied.

‘The tiger next spoke up. “Let my lord live on my own body!” he said.

“Such a thing can never be right!” the lion replied.

‘Finally Pretty-ears, full of confidence, offered himself in the same way.

And, in accordance with his offer, the lion ripped his belly open and they all
ate him up.

‘And that is why I say:
The words of rogues make even the mind of a good man waver. If he trusts
them he dies like Pretty-ears.

‘Meanwhile the brāhman met the third rogue, who spoke to him in the
same way. This time he decided that his senses were defective. So he

abandoned the goat, took a ritual ablution, and went home, while the roguestook the goat away and ate it. And so I say:He who takes a well-spoken knaveto be a man of his own stampis fooled by rogues like the brahman who was robbed of his goat.’” 41[Page 453] Pali LiteratureThe Pali language was closer to the speech of the ordinary man than wasSanskrit, and its style was in general simpler; but though they contain manyfine passages the Pali scriptures are largely prosaic and repetitive. The samestock phrases and descriptions, often quite lengthy, occur again and againwith a dull monotony which can only be circumvented by drasticabridgement. Yet the narrative portions of the Pali canon are frequently ofmuch merit. Here for instance, somewhat abridged, is an account of theBuddha’s “Great Going Forth”, a passage of intense dramatic force.

“Then lovely women, decked like the damsels of the gods with every kind of ornament and well trained in dance and song, began to perform. Butthe Bodhisattva had no taste for dancing, and for a while sleep overcamehim. The women thought: ‘He for whose sake we danced and sang hasfallen asleep-why should we trouble ourselves further?’ And they put uptheir instruments and lay down. The lamps of scented oil burned on.

“The Bodhisattva awoke and sat cross-legged on his couch. He saw the women with their instruments laid aside, fast asleep. Saliva trickled from the mouths of some; some were covered in sweat; some ground their teethin sleep; some snored; the garments of some were in disarray, so that theyrepulsively showed their private parts. When he saw them thus in theirdishevelment he was more than ever disgusted with the life of passion. Thegreat hall, decked like the heavenly palace of Indra, seemed to him like a charnel ground full of scattered corpses. Life seemed as fleeting as a houseon fire. ‘How wretched it all is! How afflicted it all is!!’ he cried, and hismind was set even more strongly on asceticism. ‘Today I must leave on theGreat Going Forth,’ he thought, and he rose from his bed and went to thedoor.

“There lay Channa, his head on the threshold. ‘Today I must go forth on the Great Going Forth,’ he said, ‘get ready my horse’. … When he had thus sent Channa he thought ‘I will see my son’, and he went to the apartments of the Mother of Rahula, and opened the bedroom door. A little lamp ofscented oil burned in the inner room. The Mother of Rahula was sleepingon a bed thickly strewn with flowers, with her son’s head on her arm. TheBodhisattva set one foot on the threshold and stood gazing at them. ‘If Imove her hand and take up my son I shall waken the queen,’ he thought,‘and then I shall not be able to go. When I am a Buddha I will come backand see my son.’ And he left the palace.”42As a further example of Pali prose we give a Jataka tale. This story,inculcating the fickleness of women, has of course no religious value, andits origin is certainly secular, but we give its framework, in order that thereader may see how the most unpromising material has been pressed intoservice for religious purposes. This story is typical of the terse dry style ofthe collection, and of the tales of [Page 454] marvels which were verypopular in India then as now. The reader will recall that the verses are theoriginal, round which the story itself is built as a sort of commentary.

“The Master, who was living at Jeta’s Grove at the time, told this story in connexion with a backsliding brother. The Master asked him if he wanted toreturn to the world and regretted taking orders. ‘It’s all because of the wilesof women.’ the monk answered. ‘Brother,’ said the Master, ‘it’s impossibleto keep on your guard against women! Wise men of old couldn’t guardagainst them, even when they dwelt in the realms of the suparnas.’ 30 Andwhen the brother pressed him the Master told an old story. ‘In former timesKing Tamba ruled the kingdom of BanĀras He had a chief queen namedSussondi, a woman of the utmost beauty. The Bodhisattva was born then asa suparna. At that time there was an island of serpents called the Island ofSeruma. In that island the Bodhisattva dwelt in a palace of suparnas.

‘One day he went to Banāras in human guise, and gambled with KingTamba. The attendants saw how fair he was, and told Sussondi that ahandsome man was gambling with the King. She wanted to see him, so oneday she put on all her ornaments and came to the gambling-hall, where,standing among her maids, she watched him. And then he saw the Queen.

The two fell in love with one another. The King of the Suparnas stirred up a magic wind in the city, and everyone rushed from the royal palace, fearing that it might fall. With his magic power he created darkness, seized the Queen, and flew to his palace in the Isle of Serpents.

‘Nobody knew where Sussondi had gone, but the Suparna took hispleasure of her and went back to play with the King. Now the King had aminstrel named Sagga. Not knowing what had happened to the Queen hesaid to the minstrel, “Go and seek over land and sea, and find out where theQueen has gone.” So he took money for his journey and, starting in thesuburbs, he sought everywhere until he came to Bhrgukaccha. Just thensome merchants of Bhrgukaccha were setting out by ship for the Land ofGold ( ? Burma). He went up to them and said, “I’m a minstrel. If you’llremit my fare and take me with you I’ll make music for you.” They agreed,took him aboard, and set sail.

‘When the ship was well under way they called him to make music forthem. “I’d willingly make music for you,” he said, “but if I did the fishwould leap out of the water and smash your ship”. “When a mere manmakes music the fish don’t get excited,” they said, “so tune up!” “Thendon’t blame me for anything that may happen,” he said, and he tuned hislute and made music, with strings and voice in perfect unison. The fishheard the sound, and leapt with excitement. Then a sea-monster ( makara)leapt from the sea, fell on the ship, and smashed it to pieces. Sagga lay on aplank and drifted with the wind to the Isle of Serpents, and landed by abanyan tree near the palace of the King of the Suparnas.

‘Now the King of the Suparnas had gone away to play dice, and so [Page455] Queen Sussondi had come down from the palace and was walking onthe shore; and she saw and recognized Sagga the minstrel, and asked himhow he came. He told her all his story. She told him not to be afraid, andcomforted him, and clasped him in her arms, and had him taken to thepalace, where she laid him on a couch. When he was revived she gave himfine food, bathed him in sweetly scented water, dressed him in fine clothes,adorned him with beautiful fragrant flowers, and again made him rest on thefine couch. So she cared for him, and whenever the King of the Suparnasreturned she hid him; then, as soon as he went again, she took passionatepleasure with him.

‘When a month and half a month had passed, merchants from Banāras
landed on that island at the foot of the banyan tree in search of fuel and
water. He boarded their ship, went back to Banāras, and saw the King while
he was gambling. Then he took his lute, and, making music, sang the first
stanza:
“There blows the scent of timira trees
with the sounding of the evil sea,
but Sussondi is far away.

Tamba, desires torment me!”
‘When he heard this, the Suparna sang the second stanza:
“How did you cross the ocean?

How came you to see Seruma?

How was it, Sagga,
that she and you did meet?”
‘Then Sagga sang three stanzas:
“From Bhrgukaccha there sailed
traders in search of wealth.

A monster broke their ship.

I floated on a plank.

“In her soft and tender lap
ever fragrant with sandal
the gentle lady pillowed me,
as a mother her own son.

“This you should know, King Tamba,
the fair-eyed lady gave me
food with her own hands,
and drink, and raiment, and a bed.”
‘Even as the minstrel sang the Suparna was filled with regret. “Though I
dwelt in the Palace of the Suparnas,” he thought, “I could not keep her!

What is the wanton to me?” So he brought her back, gave her to the King,
and went away. And he never came again.’
“When the story was over the Master declared the Four Noble Truths ( p.

269), and identified the births. … ‘Ananda ( p. 261) was the King o,
Banaras, and I was the King of the Suparnas.’” 43
[Page 455] As examples of Pali poetry we give a few verses from the
“Songs of the Elder Monks and Nuns” ( Theragāthā and Therāgāthā), a
collection of poems ascribed, falsely no doubt, to the great disciples of the
Buddha in the early days of the Order. The style of these poems is simpler
than that of courtly Sanskrit literature, and suggests the influence of popular
song. The first is attributed to Ambapālī, the beautiful courtezan of Vaisali
who became a Buddhist nun.

“Black and glossy as a bee and curled was my hair;
now in old age it is just like hemp or bark-cloth.

Not otherwise is the word of the truthful. …
“My hair clustered with flowers was like a box of sweet perfume;
now in old age it stinks like a rabbit’s pelt.

Not otherwise is the word of the truthful …
“Once my eyebrows were lovely, as though drawn by an artist;
now in old age they are overhung with wrinkles.

Not otherwise is the word of the truthful. …
“Dark and long-lidded, my eyes were bright and flashing as jewels;
now in old age they are dulled and dim.

Not otherwise is the word of the truthful. …
“My voice was as sweet as the cuckoo’s, who flies in the woodland
thickets;
now in old age it is broken and stammering.

Not otherwise is the word of the truthful. …
“Once my hands were smooth and soft, and bright with jewels and
gold;
now in old age they twist like roots.

Not otherwise is the word of the truthful. …
“Once my body was lovely as polished gold;
now in old age it is covered all over with tiny wrinkles.


Not otherwise is the word of the truthful. …
“Once my two feet were soft, as though filled with down;
now in old age they are cracked and wizened.

Not otherwise is the word of the truthful. …
“Such was my body once. Now it is weary and tottering,
the home of many ills, an old house with flaking plaster.

Not otherwise is the word of the truthful.”44
Few ancient Indian poems show such a deep love of nature as some of
these verses, ascribed to pious monks of the 5th century B.C.

[Page 457] “When the drum of the clouds thunders in heaven,
and all the ways of the birds are thick with rain,
the monk sits in the hills in ecstasy
and finds no joy greater than this.

“When by rivers covered with flowers,
and gaily adorned with reeds of varied hue,
the goodly monk sits on the bank in ecstasy
he finds no joy greater than this.

“When the rain pours down at night,
and elephants trumpet in the distant thickets,
the monk sits in the hills in ecstasy,
and finds no joy greater than this.” 45
“When the crane with clear pale wing
flies in fear from the black cloud,
seeking shelter and finding none,
The river Ajakaranī gives me joy.

“Who would not love
the rose-apple trees
fair on either bank
beside the great cavern?

“Freed from the fear of flocks of cranes
the frogs croak softly now.

This is no time to leave the hills and streams!

Safe, good and pleasant is Ajakaranā.” 46 As an example of Pali descriptive poetry we give a stirring passage from the Ceylon Chronicle, the Mahāvamsa, describing the capture of Vijitanagara, the capital of the Tamil invader Elara, by the Sinhalese national hero, King Dutthagamani ( 161–137 B.C. ), with the aid of his favourite elephant, Kandula.

“The city had three moats,
and was guarded by a high wall.

Its gate was covered with iron
hard for foes to shatter.

“The elephant knelt on his knees
and, battering with his tusks
stone and mortar and brick,
he attacked the iron gate.

[Page 458] “The Tamils from the watch-tower
threw missiles of every kind,
balls of red-hot iron
and [vessels of] molten pitch.

“Down fell the smoking pitch
upon Kandula’s back.

In anguish of pain he fled
and plunged in a pool of water.

‘This is no drinking bout!’
cried Gothaïmbara.

‘Go, batter the iron gate!

Batter down the gate!!’
“In his pride the best of tuskers
took heart and trumpeted loud.

He reared up out of the water
and stood on the bank defiant.

“The elephant-doctor washed away
the pitch, and put on balm.

The King mounted the elephant
and rubbed his brow with his hand.

‘Dear Kandula, I’ll make you
the lord of all Ceylon!’
he said, and the beast was cheered,
and was fed with the best of fodder.

“He was covered with a cloth,
and he was armoured well
with armour for his back
of seven-fold buffalo hide.

“On the armour was placed
a skin soaked in oil.

Then, trumpeting like thunder,
he came on, fearless of danger.

“He pierced the door with his tusks.

With his feet he trampled the threshold.

And the gate and the lintel
crashed loudly to the earth.” 47


[Page 459]
## Prākrit Literature
Space will not permit more than a brief reference to the Prakrit scripturesof the Jainas, examples of which we have already quoted ( p. 293f). Ingeneral they have little literary value. Like Jainism itself they tend to bearid, and, like the Pali scriptures but in even greater measure, they repeatlengthy stock phrases and descriptions, which may have had somemnemonic value, but which to the modern reader are very irritating.Lengthy descriptions of the Tirthaskaras, of pious monks, mighty kings,wealthy merchants, prosperous cities etc. occur over and over again, inexactly the same words throughout the canon, and give it a flavour ofuninspired dryness. The style is somewhat more ornate than that of the Paliscriptures, and closer to courtly Sanskrit.The poetry of the Jainas is better than their prose. In this connexion wecannot refrain from quoting a remarkable poem, which is one of the mosthumorous things in ancient Indian literature, and which, by some luckychance, has found its way into the Jaina canon, among the austere pages ofthe Sutrakrtānga. It is intended as a warning of the grim fate in store for thebacksliding monk, and throws a most unexpected light on one aspect ofIndian marriage. Our translation is rather free, but we have tried to keepsome of the lively vernacular style of the original.

“A celibate monk shouldn’t fall in love,
and though he hankers after pleasure he should hold himself in
check,
for these are the pleasures
which some monks enjoy.

“If a monk breaks his vows,
and falls for a woman,
she upbraids him and raises her foot to him,
and kicks him on the head.

‘Monk, if you won’t live with me
as husband and wife,
I’ll pull out my hair and become a nun,
for you shall not live without me!’
“But when she has him in her clutches
it’s all housework and errands!

‘Fetch a knife to cut this gourd!’
‘Get me some fresh fruit!’
“‘We want wood to boil the greens,
and for a fire in the evening!’
‘Now paint my feet!’
‘Come and massage my back!’…
[Page 460] “‘Get me my lip-salve!’
‘Find my sunshade and slippers!’
‘I want a knife to cut this string!’
‘Take my robe and have it dyed blue!’…
‘Fetch me my tweezers and my comb!’
‘Get me a ribbon to tie my hair!’
‘Now pass me my looking-glass!’
Put my toothbrush down beside me!’…
‘Fetch the pot and the drum and the rag-ball,
for our little boy to play with!’
‘Monk, the rains are on the way,
patch the roof of the house and look to the stores!’
‘Bring me the chair with the twine seat,
and my wooden-soled slippers to go out walking!’
So pregnant women boss their husbands,
just as though they were household slaves.

“When a child is born, the reward of their labours,
she makes the father hold the baby.

And sometimes the fathers of sons
stagger under their burdens like camels.

“They get up at night, as though they were nurses,
to lull the howling child to sleep,
and, though they are shamefaced about it,
scrub dirty garments, just like washermen. …
“So, monks, resist the wiles of women,
avoid their friendship and company.

The little pleasure you get from them
will only lead you into trouble!” 48
A number of medieval works of a secular nature were written in Prakrit,
chief of which are the poems “The Building of the Causeway”
( Setubandha), describing Rama’s invasion of Ceylon and falsely ascribed to
Kālidasā; “The Slaying of the King of Bengal” ( Gausavadha), a long
panegyric by the 8th-century poet Vakpati, describing the exploits of
Yasovarman, king of Kānyakubja ( p. 70); and a drama named after its
heroine, Karpūiramañjarī, by the 10th-century dramatist Rājaśekhara. These
works, though not without merit, are indistinguishable in style and content
from comparable Sanskrit productions, and need not detain us.

[Page 461] The most important literary work in Prākrit is the “SevenHundred” ( Saptasataka) of Hala. This is a large collection of selfcontainedstanzas of great charm and beauty, in the Āryā metre ( p. 51 If). Theirtraditional author was the shadowy Sātavāhana king Hala, who ruled in theDeccan in the 1st century A.D., but in fact many of these verses seemconsiderably later, and they must be looked on as anonymous. They arenotable for their conciseness; like Amaru, their authors were able to suggesta whole story in four short lines. This great economy of words and masterlyuse of suggestion would indicate that the verses were written for a highlyeducated literary audience; but they contain simple and natural descriptionsand references to the lives of peasants and the lower classes, which point topopular influence. The treatment of the love affairs of country folk remindsus of early Tamil poetry, and suggests that “Hāla” may have tapped awidely diffused source in South Indian folksong.

“Last night with scorn the lady gave the wanderer
straw for his bed.

This morning she gathers it together,


weeping.”
‘This morning, my friend, I heard a man singing,
and his song reminded me of my lover,
and opened all the wounds
that the shafts of the Love-god had made in my heart.’”
“‘Waiting for you, the first half of the night
passed like a moment.

The rest was like a year,
for I was sunk in grief.’”
“When the season of rains, with its high clouds, 31
has passed like youth,
the earliest single kāsa flower
comes, like a grey hair on the earth.”
‘Ungrateful lover, still I see the mud
in the village street,
which, on a rainy night,
I trod for your sake, shameless one!’”49
Tamil Literature
The oldest Tamil literature goes back to the early centuries of the
Christian era. Its dating is still a matter of some dispute but it [Page 462]
seems almost certain that the earliest stratum was composed before the
great Pallava dynasty of Kāncī became dominant in the Tamil Land in the
6th century, and it is probably some centuries older than this.

Tamil tradition tells of three literary academies ( śangam) which met at Madurai. The earliest of these was attended by gods and legendary sages, and all its works have perished. Of the second, there survives only the early Tamil grammar, Tolkāppiyam. The poets of the Third Śangam, on the other hand, wrote the “Eight Anthologies” ( Ettutogai), which are the greatest monument of ancient Tamil literature, as well as a number of later works.

Some authorities have doubted the tradition of the Śangams, and it is almost
certain that the grammar Tolkāppiyam, attributed to the Second Śangam, is
later than many of the poems of the Third. But the tradition of the an —gams, which is a strongly held one, has no parallel in Northern legend, andwe may believe that the bards of the Tamil Land, who wandered over thecountry enjoying the patronage of chieftains and villagers alike, would meetfrom time to time in the city of Madurai for great festivals of poetry andmusic, and that many of the verses of the Anthologies were recited there.

The poetry of the “Eight Anthologies” is little known outside the land of
its origin, and its language is so archaic that the modern educated Tamil cannot read it without special study. The relation of the language of theŚangam literature to Tamil as it is now written is perhaps similar to that ofPiers Plowman to modern English. The tradition of Tamil poetry at the timeof the composition of these works must already have been a long one, forthe poetic conventions finally fixed in the Tolkāppiyam had almost reached their finished form even in the earliest poems of the Anthologies. But theirstyle is much nearer that of folk literature than is the style of courtlySanskrit. The life of the peasant and the scenes of the countryside, thebustle of the towns and the ruthlessness of war, are here depicted as thoughfrom direct experience, and with no formal unrealistic idealization.

Together the “Eight Anthologies “32 make up a very large body of poeticliterature, and contain well over 2,000 poems, ascribed to more than 200authors. To them must be added “The Ten Songs” ( Pattuppāttu), containingten longer poems of similar style but somewhat later date. Until the end of the last century this great collection was [Page 463] almost forgotten, evenby the Tamils themselves; only within the last fifty years have the raremanuscripts containing it been edited and given to the world. Much is stilluntranslated, and the full and thorough study of the Śangam literature fromthe critical and historical point of view has yet to be made.

Very early the Tamils developed the passion for classification which is noticeable in many aspects of ancient Indian learning. Poetry was divided into two main groups: “internal” ( agam), dealing with love, and “external” ( puram), dealing with the praise of kings. A further division was made according to the region of the Tamil Land to which the poem referred orwas most appropriate. Conventionally there were five regions ( tinai): thehills ( kurinji), the dry lands ( pālai), the jungle and woodland ( mullai), thecultivated plains ( marudam), and the coast ( neydal). Each was connectedwith some special aspect of love or war; thus the hills were the scene ofpoems on pre-nuptial love and cattle-raiding; the dry lands, of the longseparation of lovers, and of the laying waste of the countryside; the jungle,of the brief parting of lovers, and of raiding expeditions; the valleys, ofpost-nuptial love or the wiles of courtezans, and of siege; and the seacoast,of the parting of fishermen’s wives from their lords, and of pitched battle.

To each region were attributed its own appropriate flowers, animals and people. Every poem of the “Eight Anthologies” was classified in one of the five sections, but much of the poetry was written with little regard for this formal classification.

A unique feature of Tamil poetry is the initial rhyme or assonance. This
does not appear in the earliest Tamil literature, but by the end of the
Śangam period it was quite regular. The first syllable, or syllables, of each
couplet must rhyme. Thus:
ISAITAD’ eninum iyarrior drrdl
AIrADu nirpadm dnmai; isaiyungal
KANDARirai alaikkuh kdnal an tan serppa
PENDIRum valaro marru.”
“Though you fail, to work and struggle,
unwaveringly steadfast-this is manliness.

Lord of the cool and lovely shore, where the waves shake the thorny
groves!

Will not even women flourish in prosperity?’” 50 This initial assonance, in some poems continued through four or more lines, is never to be found in the poetry of Sanskritic languages, or as far as we know, in that of any other language. Its effect, a little strange at first, rapidly becomes pleasant to the reader, and to the Tamil is as enjoyable as the end rhyme of European poetry.

[Page 464] We give a brief anthology of short poems and extracts from
this wonderful literature. 33
Here a mother tells of her son, who has gone to war.

“If you lean against the pillar of my little home
and ask the whereabouts of my son,
I reply, ‘I cannot tell you’.

Behold, like a tiger’s cavern of rock,
the womb that bore him!

You will find him on the field of war.”52
The three following poems are attributed to the poetess Avvaiyar.

“It charms not like the harp,
it accords not with the time-beat,
it conveys no meaning,
but the prattling of a son
brings bliss to his father.

So, O King Nedumai Anji,
through the grace of your favour
my empty words are imbued with meaning.

O King, you have overcome the enemy’s forts,
though unscaleable were their walls.”53
“To allow the little children of the village
to wash clean its white tusks,
the huge elephant will lie on the river bank.

O great King, you favour me like that!

But to approach an elephant in rut is death,
and you are death to your foes, O King!” 54
Here Avvaiyar compares the wealth of the luxurious king of Tondai
( Kāncī) with that of her own warlike chief.

“Bedecked with peacock-feathers, garlanded with flowers,
fine are the Tondai spears in the spacious armoury,
with their strong shafts, and sharp points bright with ghee.

The weapons of my king are blunt with fighting,
broken their points through parrying the thrusts of the foe.

The swordsmith’s forge is busy with repairs.

My king, when rich, freely gives food away,
when poor he messes with his men.

He is the head of the family of the poor,
yet great is he, with his sharp-pointed spear.”55
[Page 465] “O bee, fair of wing, ever in search of flower-garlands,
tell me not what I fain would hear, but what you really saw!

Among all the flowers you know is any more fragrant
than the tresses of my lady of the close-set teeth?

Graceful as the peacock she dwells, rich in love, with me!” 56
“Ever anew aches my heart!

Again and again I brush off the burning tears.

My love, once peaceful at my side, grows restless.

My heart aches!”57
“In the gathering night
hushed of speech all men sweetly sleep.

Devoid of wrath,
countless people in the world are resting.

I alone sleep not!”58
Here a mother asks an ascetic the whereabouts of her daughter, who has
eloped with her lover. The sage offers her this consolation:
“Save to the wearer of its scent,
of what use is the sandalwood tree,
even to the mountains amid which it was born?

If you ponder the matter, it is so with your daughter.

“Except to the wearer of it
of what avail is the highly prized white pearl,
even to the sea in which it was reared?

If you ponder the matter, it is so with your daughter.”59
Here a girl speaks to her playmate:
“What bright bracelets you have! Do listen!

As I was playing in the road
he kicked over my mud castle with his foot,
and snatched the garland from my head,
and ran away with my striped ball.

How he teased me, the naughty boy!

“Another day my mother and I
were together, when a voice called out:
‘Whoever’s at home, please give me some water!’
Mother said to me: ‘My dear,
fill the gilded vessel, and give him water to drink!’
I went out, not knowing who it was.

He caught my wrist, with the bangles on, and squeezed it,
and I was frightened, and cried out:
[Page 466] ‘Mother, just look what he’s done!’
She was very upset, and hurried down,
but I told her he’d hiccups because of the water.

He looked at me as if he could kill me,
but then the rogue made friends with a smile.”60
Here a newly married girl makes her first attempts at cooking:
“Her fingers, slender as the kandal blossom, had been squeezing the new
curds.

Her clothes had not been washed since she wiped her fingers on them.

The appetizing steam had got into her lily-like eyes.

Yet, as she rubbed them, he just said, ‘The curry you’ve cooked is
delicious.’
He of the bright brow was most pleased with what he was eating.”61
Striking touches of natural description often illumine the rather
monotonous panegyrics:
“Though the milk turn sour, though day turn to night,
though the path of the Vedas lead men astray,
may you stand unshaken, long famed, with loyal
supporters, that, in the foothills of the mountains,
the large-eyed mother doe with her small-headed fawn
may sleep secure at evening by the flame of the three fires
of hermits who perform hard penances.”62
“Unfailing in the hard tasks of war,
O king, like death, for whom there is no cure,
though the earth be moved from her place, your name is eternalyou,
whose legs wear golden anklets, whose broad breast
is spread with drying sandal-paste!

In an uninhabited land, a land of bitter hardship,
a land without water, a land of long tracks,
your valiant warriors fight, unerring in their archery,
gazing afar, with their hands hung over their eyes.

There, in the silk-cotton tree, where roads diverge,
the eagle, with trim feathers and crooked beak,
wails over the new cairns of those who have shot their arrows.”63
Here a girl consoles her lovelorn friend:
“‘The toiling fishermen catch the shoals
in their close-meshed nets, and the soft-headed prawn,
thin as the cassia bud in the forest.

“‘Like hunters who chase the deer in the woods
young fishermen chase in the waste of the waters
the saw-toothed shark, and return with meat.

[Page 467] “‘They return to the shore and unload on the sand,
where the wind plays wild across the saltpans,
and soon the street of the fishing village
will ring with the wheels of your lover’s chariot.’”64
A young man praises his sweetheart’s cookery:
‘At every post before the house
is tied the gentle calf of a crooked-horned buffalo.

There dwells my sweetheart, curving and lovely,
languid of gaze, with big round earrings,
and little rings on her tiny fingers.

“‘She has cut the leaves of the garden plantain
and split them in pieces down the stalk
to serve as platters for the meal.

Her eyes are filled with the smoke of cooking.

Her brow, as fair as the crescent moon,
is covered now with drops of sweat.

She wipes it away with the hem of her garment
and stands in the kitchen, and thinks of me.

“‘Come in then, if you want a good meal!

You’ll see her smile and show her tiny
sharp teeth, whom I long to kiss.’”65
A village festival:
“The farmers who harvest rice in the hot sun
now leap into the waves of the clear sea.

The sailors, captains of stout craft,
drink strong liquor and dance for joy,
as they clasp the bright-bangled hands of women
who wear garlands of clustering pusai. …
“In the cool woods, where the bees seek flowers,
women, bright-bangled and garlanded, drink
the juice of the palm and the pale sugar-cane,
and the juice of the coconut which grows in the sand,
then running they plunge into the sea.” 66
A poignant description of famine:
“The hearth has forgotten cooking:
It is overgrown with moss and mould.

The woman, thin with hunger,
has breasts like wrinkled bladders.

Their nipples are quite dry,
but the child chews them, weeping.

She looks down at his face
and tears hang on her lashes.”67
[Page 468] Our final quotation from the “Eight Anthologies” is the plaint
of a neglected wife:
“My garment smells of ghee and frying curry,
and is stained with dirt and lampblack.

“My shoulders stink with the sweat of the child


whom I carry upon them and feed at my breast.

“I cannot face my lord, who, in gay attire,
rides in his car to the street of the harlots.” 68
The next stratum of Tamil literature shows much greater Aryan influence.

Āryan religious ideas and practices, not unknown even in the Eight Anthologies, had by now been thoroughly grafted on to the original Tamil heritage, and Jaina influence is prominent. “The Eighteen Minor Works”( Padinenkilkanakku) are largely gnomic and moralizing in character, thetwo most famous being the Tirukkural, and the Nāladiyār. The former,sometimes called the “Bible of the Tamil Land” is a series of brief metricalproverbs on many aspects of life and religion, and we have already quoted some of its aphorisms ( p. 339). We add a few others of a more secular type.

“Vain is the kingdom where are all good things
but no love between ruler and ruled.”

“Even the hermit ceases his penance
if the husbandman folds his arms.”

“Earth laughs in scorn
at those who plead poverty.”

“No food is sweeter than rice-gruel,
when you have worked for it.”

“Wide as the sea is the joy of love,
but wider still the sorrow of parting.”

“Love is stronger than wine,
for the very thought of it intoxicates.”


“Sweethearts delight in a lover’s quarrel
for the greater delight of making it up.” 69
Ndla.diyar is more formal and literary in style, and contains verses of
much merit and high ethical content.

[Page 469] “Better hatred than the friendship of fools.

Better death than chronic illness.

Better to be killed than soul-destroying contempt.

Better abuse than praise undeserved.”
“True housekeeping is to eat a meal
sharing, as far as may be, with friend and foe alike.

The useless men who eat their food alone
will never pass the gate of heaven.”
“Though you feed him with care from a golden dish
a dog will always prefer carrion.

Though you deal with the base as you would with the good
their deeds will always show them up.”
“Hillmen remember their lovely hills.

Farmers remember their fertile fields.

The good remember another’s kindness.

The base recall only fancied slights.”
“As a scroll read by one who well understands it,
as wealth to the man of generous spirit,
as a sharp sword in a warrior’s hand,
is the beauty of a faithful wife.”
“To those who once embraced their lovers
whose broad chests were hung with garlands,
when their loved ones are away
the thunder sounds like a funeral drum.”70

By the 6th century Āryan influence had penetrated the whole of the Tamil land, and her kings and chiefs worshipped and supported the gods ofHinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The indigenous style of poetry wasrapidly altering under the influence of Sanskrit, and Tamil poets took towriting long poems which they called by the Sanskrit name kivya. Theearliest and greatest of these is “The Jewelled Anklet” ( Śilappadigāram),which is still very different from Sanskrit poetry. Though written for aneducated audience and in faultless literary style it is near to the life of thepeople; it is by comparison realistic, dealing with the lives of two ordinaryfolk enmeshed in unhappy circumstance, and, unlike the Sanskrit courtly“epic”, it sounds a note of true tragedy.

The traditional author of the poem was Ilangovadigal, a grandson of the great Cola king Karikalan, who lived in the 1st or 2nd century A.D. The tradition is certainly false, and the poem is several [Page 470] centurieslater. Its author, whoever he was, though a great poet, was not a greatstoryteller. His tale was well known to his hearers, and he could afford to be irritatingly allusive and terse in important narrative passages, and lingerlovingly over interesting description. He successfully drew together all thethemes of earlier Tamil poets and welded them into a whole, in theframework of the story of the luckless Kovalan and Kannagi. Rightly thispoem and Kamban’s Rdmdyanam are looked on as the national Epics of theTamil people. We give an outline of the story, with a translation,considerably abridged, of its climax, which has a grimly baroque force andsplendour, unparalleled elsewhere in Indian literature. It is imbued withboth the ferocity of the early Tamils and their stern respect for justice, and,incidentally, throws much light on the character of early Tamil kingship.

Kovalan, the son of a wealthy merchant of the city of Pugar or Kavirippattinam, married Kannagi, the lovely daughter of another merchant. For some time they lived together happily, until, at a festival at the royal court, Kovalan, met the dancer Madavi, and fell in love with her.

He bought her favours and in his infatuation forgot Kannagi and his home.

Gradually he spent all his wealth on the dancer, even to Kannagi’s jewels.

At last he was penniless, and returned repentantly to his uncomplaining  wife. Their only fortune was a precious pair of anklets, which she gave to him willingly. With these as their capital they decided to go to the great city of Madurai, where Kovalan hoped to recoup his fortunes by trade.

On their arrival at Madurai they found shelter in a cottage, and Kovalanwent to the market, to sell one of Kannagi’s anklets. But the queen ofNedunjeliyan, king of the Pandyas, had just been robbed of a similar ankletby a wicked court jeweller. The jeweller happened to see Kovalan withKannagi’s anklet, and immediately seized it and informed the King. Guardswere sent to apprehend Kovalan, who was cut down immediately, withouttrial. When the news was brought to Kannagi she fainted away; but shequickly recovered and, with her eyes ablaze with anger, she went out intothe town, carrying the remaining anklet in her hand as proof of herhusband’s innocence.

‘Chaste women of Madurai, listen to me!

Today my sorrows cannot be matched.

Things which should never have happened have befallen me.

How can I bear this injustice?’…
“All the folk of the rich city of Madurai
saw her, and were moved by her grief and affliction.

In wonder and sorrow they cried:
‘Wrong that cannot be undone has been done to this lady!

[Page 471] ‘Our King’s straight sceptre is bent!

What can this mean?

Lost is the glory of the King Over Kings,
the Lord of the Umbrella and Spear! …
‘A new and a mighty goddess
has come before us,
in her hand a golden anklet!

What can this mean?

‘This woman afflicted and weeping
from her lovely dark-stained eyes
is as though filled with godhead!

What can this mean?’
“Thus, raising loud accusing voices,
the people of Madurai befriended and comforted her,
and among the tumultuous throng
some showed her her husband’s body.

“She, the golden vine, beheld him,
but her he could not see. …
“Then the red-rayed sun folded his fiery arms
and hid behind the great mountain,
and the wide world
was veiled in darkness.

“In the brief twilight
Kanagi cried aloud
and the whole city
echoed her wailing.

“In the morning she had taken the wreath from his neck
and decked her hair with its flowers;
in the evening she saw him lying
in a pool of his own blood.

“But he saw not the agony of her grief
as she mourned in sorrow and wrath. …
[Page 472] ‘Are there women here? Are there women
who could bear such wrong
done to their wedded lords?

Are there women here? Are there such women?

‘Are there good men here? Are there good men
who cherish their children
and guard them with care?

Are there men here? Are there such men?

‘Is there a god here? Is there a god
in this city of Madurai, where the sword of a king
has slain an innocent man?

Is there a god here? Is there a god?’
“Lamenting thus she clasped her husband’s breast,
and it seemed that he rose to his feet and said,
‘The full-moon of your face has faded,’
and he stroked her face with his hands.

“She fell to the ground, sobbing and crying,
and clasped her lord’s feet with her bangled hands;
and he left behind his human form
and went, surrounded by the gods.

“And, as he went, he said,
‘My darling, you must stay!’
‘Surely this
was a vision,’ she cried.

‘I will not join my lord
till my great wrath is appeased!

I will see the cruel King,
and ask for his explanation!’
“And she stood on her feet,
her large eyes full of tears,
and, wiping her eyes,
she went to the gate of the palace.

“I saw, alas, I saw in a dream
the sceptre fall and the royal umbrella.

The bell at the palace gate rang of itself,
while the whole heaven shook in confusion!

‘A darkness swallowed the sun,
a rainbow glowed in the night,
and a burning meteor
crashed to the earth by day.’


“Thus spoke the Queen,
and took her maids and her bodyguard,
and went to the King on the lion-throne,
and told him her evil dream.

[Page 473] “Then came a cry from the gate:
‘Ho, Gatekeeper! Ho, Gatekeeper!!

Ho, Gatekeeper of the King who has lost wisdom,
whose evil heart has swerved from justice!!

‘Tell the King that a woman with an anklet,
an anklet from a pair of tinkling anklets,
a woman who has lost her husband,
is waiting at the gate.’
“And the gatekeeper went to the King and said:
‘A woman waits at the gate.

She is not Korravai, goddess of victory,
with triumphant spear in her hand. …
‘Filled with anger, boiling with rage,
a woman who has lost her husband,
an anklet of gold in her hand,
is waiting at the gate.’”
Kannagi was then admitted to the King’s presence.

‘Cruel King, this I must say. …
‘My lord Kovalan came
to Madurai to earn wealth,
and today you have slain him
as he sold my anklet.’
‘Lady,’ said the King,
‘it is kingly justice
to put to death
an arrant thief.’”
Then Kannagi showed her anklet to the King. On comparing it very
carefully with the remaining anklet of the pair belonging to the Queen, he
realized that Kovalan had been innocent.

“When he saw it the parasol fell from his head
and the sceptre trembled in his hand.

‘I am no king,’ he said,
‘who have heeded the words of the goldsmith.

‘I am the thief. For the first time
I have failed to protect my people.

Now may I die!’
[And he fell to the ground, dead. 3
[Page 474] Then Kannagi said to the Queen:
‘If I have always been true to my husband
I will not suffer this city to flourish,
but I will destroy it as the King is destroyed!

Soon you will see that my words are true!’
“And with these words she left the palace,
and cried out through the city, ‘Men and women
of great Madurai of the four temples,
listen! Listen you gods in heaven!

‘Listen to me, you holy sages!

I curse the capital of the King
who so cruelly wronged
my beloved lord!’
“With her own hand she tore the left breast from her body.

Thrice she surveyed the city of Madurai,
calling her curse in bitter agony.

Then she flung her fair breast on the scented street. …
“And the burning mouth of the Fire-god opened
as the gods who guarded the city closed their doors. …
“The high priest, the astrologer and the judges,
the treasurer and the learned councillors,
the palace servants and the maids,
stood silent and still as painted pictures.

“The elephant-riders and horsemen,
the charioteers and the foot-soldiers
with their terrible swords, all fled from the fire
which raged at the gate of the royal palace. …
“And the street of the sellers of grain,
the street of the chariots, with its bright-coloured garlands,
and the four quarters of the four classes
were filled with confusion and flamed like a forest on fire. …
“In the street of the singing girls
where so often the tabor had sounded
with the sweet gentle flute and the tremulous harp …
the dancers, whose halls were destroyed, cried out:
‘Whence comes this woman? Whose daughter is she?

A single woman, who has lost her husband,has conquered the evil King with her anklet,and has destroyed our city with fire’”71[Page 475] At last the patron goddess of the city interceded withKannagi, and she agreed to withdraw her curse, and the fire abated. Weakwith loss of blood from her self-amputated breast, Kannagi struggled to ahill outside the city, where, after a few days, she died, and was reunitedwith Kovalan in heaven. Meanwhile the news of her death spreadthroughout the Tamil Land. She was deified, and temples raised andfestivals held in her honour, and she became the patron goddess of wifelyloyalty and chastity.

A little later than “The Jewelled Anklet” was composed its sequelManimigalai, attributed to the poet Sattan of Madurai. Though by traditionit is the earlier of the two all other evidence suggests the opposite, for itassumes the reader’s knowledge of “The Jewelled Anklet”, to which it is asort of Buddhistic supplement. “The Jewelled Anklet”, though containingmany religious and moral lessons, was primarily written to tell a story,while in Manimegalai the story is a mere framework for philosophicalpolemic, and the atmosphere of the narrative passages has some of theotherworldly formality of the courtly Sanskrit kavya. The heroine,Manimegalai, is the daughter of Kovalan, the hero of “The JewelledAnklet”, by the dancer Madavi, who became a Buddhist nun on hearing ofher former lover’s death. The story tells of the love of PrinceUdayakumaran -for Manimegalai, and the miraculous preservation of herchastity. In the end she becomes a Buddhist nun like her mother, and mostof the poem is taken up with her discussions with members of various sects,both Hindu and heterodox, and her triumphant refutation of their doctrines.A third Tamil “epic”, Sivaga-Sindimani, describes the exploits of thehero Sivaga or Jivaka, a superman who excels in every art from archery tothe curing of snake-bite, and who wins a new bride for his harem with everyfeat, only to become a Jaina monk after his many triumphs. The author wasa Jaina, Tiruttakkadevar. His work is fantastic and lacking in any contactwith real life; its style is elegant and ornate, and much influenced by courtlySanskrit. It is definitely later than the other two “epics”.By now Tamil poets were not satisfied with their own traditions, andtranslations and adaptations of many Northern works were made, the mostnotable of which is Kamban’s Rāmāyanam, composed in the 9th century.

This great poem is still known and loved in the Tamil Land, and is by nomeans a mere translation of the original, for Kamban adapts themes as hethinks fit, and here and there adds episodes of his own. It is noteworthy thatin Kamban’s hands the demon Ravan a frequently takes on the proportionsof a heroic figure, and contrasts favourably with the rather weak andunimpressive Rāma. Like Milton, Kamban was of the devil’s party withoutknowing [Page 476] it. The real glory of medieval Tamil literature,however, is undoubtedly the hymns of the Śaivite and Vaisnavite devotionalteachers, which are among the great religious literature of the world, andwhich we have discussed and quoted in another connexion ( p. 330ff). Otherthan these, later Tamil literature produced little of the first order.

The canon of the Tamil saivites contains work of merit ( p. 334), but theadaptations of the Puranas and the lengthy commentaries on earlierliterature, though not unimportant, need not be discussed here. 34The early literatures of Canarese, Telugu and Malayalam, which hadbegun to be written before the end of our period, are less important than thatof Tamil, and need not detain us. They originated at a time when Āryaninfluence was already thoroughly entrenched, and, though containing manybeauties, lack the originality of early Tamil poetry. Thus they cannot aspireto the importance of Tamil, which can claim one of the longest unbrokenliterary traditions of any of the world’s living languages.

## Folk Poetry
35
The literatures which we have been discussing were all the work of literary schools with formal conventions and long traditions. Some poetry,obviously, is less formalized than that of classical Sanskrit, and here andthere, notably in the verses of the Tamil anthologies and the PrākritSaptaiataka, we seem to catch echoes of folk-song and popular oralliterature. No Indian writer, however, as far as we know, thought fit torecord the folk-song of ancient India, which, if we are to judge by modemanalogy, must have been plentiful and of high quality. But a few verses havebeen preserved in Chinese translation, which may well be the words ofgenuine folk-songs of pre-Gupta times.

That part of the Buddhist canon called Samyutta NikSya ( p. 267) was first translated into Chinese about A.D. 440, from a manuscript acquired in Ceylon by Fa-hsien in 411. At the end of the book occurs a section which isnot to be found in the Pali version as it exists at [Page 477] present, butwhich must have been included in Fa-hsien’s manuscript. Probably theverses here quoted were sung in India between the time of the codificationof the Pali canon in the 1st century B.C. ( p. 266) and the beginning of the 5thcentury A.D.The passage in question describes a monk, who hears the singing ofvarious secular songs, and converts them to Buddhist purposes bycomparatively slight alterations. Thus the first verse quoted is capped by themonk with a pious wish that he may gently flow to Nirvana, and so on.

The song of a lady who got on badly with her “in-laws”:
“O river Ganges, all I now wantis to go with your waters that flow gently to the sea;that never again by my father- and mother-in-lawI may at every turn be scolded and abused.”The song of a melon-thief:“Bright moon, I beg you not to come out.

Wait where you are till I have cut these melons.

But when I have got my melons safely away,
then come out or not, just as you please.”
The song of a poor man:
“So long as I own just one pig,
and a single jar full of good wine,
one cup to pour the wine into,
and someone to fill my cup again and again-
so long as I own just as much as that,
there is nothing else that bothers me at all.”
The song of a girl who, going to a tryst with her lover on a rainy night,
slips and falls in the mud:,
“The hair of my head is all loose and astray;
my lovely necklace has fallen in the deep mud.

My rings and bracelets are all broken and spoiled;
when I come to my lover, what shall I give him to wear?”
The song of a lover, picnicking with his mistress:
“With thoughts of love, all for our ease and pleasure,
we loiter under the shade of the green trees.

The running stream flows swift and clear,
the sound of my zither is very tuneful and sweet.

The spring weather is just right for our jaunt;
what happiness could there be greater than ours?”
[Page 478] Advice to a dove:
“Dove, my bird, you must lay up your stores-
sesamum-seed, rice, millet and the rest-
and take them to a tree on the very top of the hill,
and make yourself a nest-cavern high and bright.

Then when Heaven sends the rainy season
you will be sure of lodging, food and drink.”

7 The Vedic Vulcan.

8 Literally “a horse’s tail”, probably implying a wisp of cloud.

9 The exact meanings of several words and phrases of this hymn are quite uncertain. In translating I have given the sense which seems to me most probable, and filled out the elliptical Sanskrit to make the meaning clearer.

10 I.e. the vibhidaka nuts, loosely translated “dice”. See p. 207f.

11 Literally “wealth”. It is almost certain that there was no coined money in India at the time of this poem’s composition ( p. 220).

12 I.e. gambles with the brown nuts.

13 Sitd means “furrow”, and the heroine of the epic has some of the attributes of an agricultural goddess. According to the story she was not the natural daughter of King Janaka, but sprang from his plough while he was working in the fields. This story evidently looks back to a time when the tribal chieftain was ready to lend a hand with the work of the tribe.

14 This rather grim ending to the story did not satisfy some gentler spirits.

Bhavabhfuti’s Uttarardmacarita, a drama of the 8th century, concludes with the full reconciliation of Rāma and Sītā.

( Kdvyaprakdsa, early 12th century), and Viśvanātha ( Sāhityadarpaza, 14th
century).

17 For further notes on Sanskrit prosody see Appendix, p. 508ff.

18 The second line of the original of this verse ( ” press on with faster
pace, having shed your load of water” ) is skilfully alliterated on the
consonant t, giving an impression of haste to the slow metre and suggesting
the patter of raindrops:
Sthitvā tasmin vanacara-vadhu-bhukta-kunje muhurtalp,
toyotsarga-drutatara-gatis tatparam vartma tirzaz,

19 The mastery of language in the last three stanzas quoted is so
remarkable that it must impress even the reader who knows no Sanskrit.

With brilliant use of assonance and alliteration Kālidasā has wedded sound
to sense in a way rarely achieved in the literature of the world.

20 This is one of the conventions of poetry. The eyes of a pretty girl are so long that their corners almost touch her ears.

21 We quote the Sanskrit, in the hope that some of Bāna’s wonderful sound effects, which seem so well to fit the sense of his verses, may be recognized.

22 The rhyme scheme varies from lyric to lyric. Here the second and fourth quarters end with a rhyme of two syllables, while the first and third quarters of each stanza end with the same syllable. The first and third quarters end in e throughout the poem. The refrain applies equally to the love of Krsna for Rādhā and the love of God for the soul. We quote the last verse so that the reader may have some idea of the mellifluousness of the original:
Bhanati kavi-Jayadeve
virahi-vilasitena
manasi rabhasa-vibhave
Harir udayatu sukrtena.

Tava virahe vanamali sakhi sidati.

23 Stories such as this puzzle the social historian. If the texts on the Sacred Law have any relation to real life it is quite incredible that a girl of good class in the 11th century should have been given such freedom by her parents, or should even have thought of legally marrying a despised outcaste. The story probably looks back to a much earlier time, when social relations were very much freer.

24 The simile is not unduly exaggerated, as the dancer was covered with jewellery, which glittered in the sunlight.

25 This convention of the Indian stage was known to Goethe from Sir William Jones’ translation of Śakuntalā, and was adapted by him for the prologue of Faust.

26 This stage direction is inserted by us. All the others are Kālidasā’s. In their comparatively full stage directions Sanskrit plays contrast strikingly with those of ancient Greece.

27 Though a fair complexion was much prized in ancient India a trace of brownness in the hair, fairly common in the North, was thought very unbeautiful and inauspicious.

28 The economics of this and the other transaction referred to are very hard to explain. No doubt the rice husks, so carefully threshed, had some commercial value, but it is hardly likely that it would have bought the wares mentioned. If this passage has any historical significance it confirms the evidence of other sources that in ordinary times the means of subsistence were plentiful and cheap.

29 Cowell and Thomas ( The Harsacarita of Bdaa, p. 200) take lavanakalday as “wooden figures of deer” on the basis of a late commentary. Lavana means salt, and kalāya a type of pea, and we believe the compound to mean a bag of salted peas, the horse’s iron rations. Thetranslation of kikiti-ndli-sanatha as “bells with reeds attached” is equallyimprobable. The horse’s harness would be hung with bells, but nālī, “reed”or “tube”, may well mean a whistle attached to the harness by a cord, andused for signalling.

30 A class of large mythical bird, of whom Garuda ( p. 300) is the chief.

31 There is a pun here on paohare, which may mean either “clouds” or
“breasts”.

32 Narrinai: 400 short poems on love, each of from nine to twelve lines; Kuruntośai, 400 love poems of from four to eight lines each; Aingurunuru, 600 short erotic poems; Padirruppa.ttu, a short collection of eight ( originally ten) poems, each of ten verses, in praise of the king of the Cera country ( Malabar); Paripādal, twenty-four ( originally seventy) poems in praise of gods; Kalittogai, 150 love poems; Aganānāru, 400 lovelyrics of varying length; and Purandanuru, 400 poems in praise of kings.

33 The first ten extracts are the work of Mr J. R. Marr, to whom we are much indebted for permission to use them. The other translations are our own, some made with the help of the many literal translations of Prof. P. T.

S. Iyengar. 51
34 Perhaps the greatest literary figure in later Tamil was Viramamunivar ( 1680–1747), a pseudonym of Father Costanzio Beschi, an Italian Jesuit who taught for thirty-six years in the Tamil country. Like many earlyChristian missionaries, he lived in wholly Indian fashion and attained acomplete mastery of the Tamil language and literary conventions. It isdoubtful if any European before or since has gained so profound aknowledge of an Indian language. Beschi’s long poem Témbāvani tellsstories from the Old and New Testaments in ornately beautiful Tamil. Hisstyle and the treatment of his themes were altogether in keeping withtradition, but the influence of Tasso has been traced in his work.

EPILOGUE: THE HERITAGE OF INDIA


## THE IMPACT OF THE WEST
[Page 479]
INDIA’S ancient culture did not perish before the onslaughts of the Muslims, as did that of Persia. Under the rule of some of the Delhi sultans of the Middle Ages there was persecution, and we read of temples being razed to the ground and brāhmans put to death for practising their devotions in public; but in general the Muslims were reasonably tolerant, and at alltimes Hindu chiefs continued to rule in outlying parts of India, payingtribute to their Muslim overlords. Conversions to Islam were numerous,though only in a few regions were the majority of Indians persuaded toembrace the new faith. Hindu and Muslim lived side by side and, after afew centuries, the Hindus in those parts of India dominated by Muslimsoften accepted the situation as normal. In such conditions mutual influencewas inevitable. Hindus began to learn Persian, the official language of theirMuslim rulers, and Persian words found their way into the vernaculars.

Well-to-do Hindu families often adopted the system of “strict parda” from the Muslims, and made their womenfolk veil their faces in public. The surviving Hindu kings borrowed new military techniques from theMuslims, learnt to employ cavalry with greater effect, and to use heavierarmour and new types of weapon. One great religious teacher of medievalIndia, Kabīr (1440–1518), a poor weaver of Banāras, taught thebrotherhood of Hindu and Muslim alike in the fatherhood of God, andopposed idolatry and caste practices, declaring that God was equally to befound in temple and mosque. Later, Nanāk (1469–1533), a teacher of thePanjāb, taught the same doctrine with even greater force, and founded anew faith, that of the Sikhs, designed to incorporate all that was best of bothHinduism and Islām.

Nevertheless the Muslim invasions, and the enforced contact with, newideas, did not have the fertilizing effect upon Hindu culture which mighthave been expected. Hinduism was already very conservative when thelieutenants of Muhammad of Ghor conquered the Ganges Valley. In theMiddle Ages, for every tolerant and progressive teacher there must havebeen hundreds of orthodox brahmans, who looked upon themselves as thepreservers of the immemorial Āryan Dharma against the barbarians whooverran the holy [Page 480] land of Bhāratavarsa. Under their influence thecomplex rules of the Hindu way of life became if anything stricter and morerigidly applied.

In the 16th and 17th centuries the Mughal emperors unified practicallythe whole of North India and much of the Deccan, and built up an empiresuch as had not been seen since the days of the Guptas. The Mughal periodwas one of great splendour, which has left its mark on India in the form ofmany lovely buildings, wherein Islamic and Hindu motifs often blended ina perfect unity. The Taj Mahal at Agra, the Mughal capital, is of course themost famous memorial of the times. Akbar ( 1555–1606), the contemporaryof Queen Elizabeth I and the first of the four great Mughal emperors, fullyrealized that the Empire could only stand on a basis of complete toleration.

All religious tests and disabilities were abolished, including the hated poll-tax on unbelievers. Rajput princes and other Hindus were given high officesof state, without conversion to Islam, and inter-communal marriages wereencouraged by the example of the Emperor himself. If the policy of thegreatest of India’s Muslim rulers had been continued by his successors, herhistory might have been very different.

The great-grandson of Akbar, Aurangzeb (1659–1707), reversed the policy of toleration. Restrictions were placed on the free practice of Hindu rites and preferment at court was confined to orthodox Muslims; later thetax on non-Muslims was reimposed. After nearly a century of equality thiswas bitterly resented by many Hindus, especially by the chiefs, many ofwhom had loyally served the earlier Mughals. The main resistance camefrom the Western Deccan where, around Poona, the Maratha chief Śivājī(1627–1680) laid the foundations of a new Hindu empire. At about thesame time the Sikhs of the Panjāb, incensed at the new policy and thepersecution of their leaders, reformed their faith, and were welded into acloselyknit martial brotherhood. When the aged Aurangzeb died theMughal empire was virtually at an end.

Politically the 18th century was one of Hindu revival. Though the Maratha successors of Śivājī could not build up a large, closely-knit empire their horsemen ranged far and wide over India, levying tribute from local chiefs, Hindu and Muslim alike. In the Panjāb towards the end of the century the Sikhs built an important kingdom, and almost everywhere Islamwas on the defensive. But there was still no real cultural revival inHinduism. Śivājī, a brilliant leader, a just ruler, and a statesman ofconsummate craft, was conservative in his outlook, and appeared to hiscontemporaries rather as a restorer of the old than as a builder of the new.

Unlike Akbar, he had no fresh vision of a state transcending religious differences, though he learnt [Page 481] much from the Mughals in statecraft and military science and respected the faith of his adversaries.

The Marathas did not encourage reforms in Hindu society, and the India of the 18th century was if anything more conservative than it had been in the days of the first Muslim invasions. It was through the influence of Europe that revival came. Early in the16th century the Portuguese founded the first European trading stations andsettlements. They were followed by Dutch, British, Danes and French, andthroughout the 17th century the number of European “factories “increased.In the 18th century, with the breakup of the Mughal empire, the Europeansbegan to take greater interest in local politics, and by the early 19th centurythe British East India Company had virtually pushed out its rivals anddominated most of the sub-continent. The comparative ease with which theBritish established their supremacy is a measure of the political decadenceof India at the time. By the middle of the 19th century the whole of Indiawas either directly ruled by Britain, or governed indirectly through pettyprinces with local autonomy. A new conqueror had come, a conqueror farmore alien to the Hindu than the Muslims had been, with an aggressiveculture and immense technical superiority.

Hindu society reacted at first to the British rulers as it had done to the Muslims, tending to withdraw itself even more into the closed circle of its ancient traditions, and there was no realization of a fundamental break with the past. From the orthodox point of view the British rulers of Indiaconstituted a caste, low in the social scale, which had succeeded in gainingpolitical power. This caste had its own rules and customs which were notthose of the Āryan, and should therefore not be imitated. The British readilyaccepted this position, and, after the 18th century, made few attempts atsocial contact. Any real friendship between Englishman and Indian becamemore and more difficult as the century progressed-in fact the Englishman inIndia unconsciously tended to adopt the ideas of social stratification of theIndians whom he ruled, and to look upon his own people as members of aclass so exalted above the Indians that any close association with them wastaboo. This attitude was strengthened by the Mutiny of 1857.

Nevertheless the presence of Europeans could not but have its effect. Except in certain parts of South India missionary activity in the 18thcentury was insignificant; but early in the 19th century the Britishevangelical conscience awakened to India, and missions and missionschools sprang up in all the larger towns. Meanwhile the Company felt agrowing need for subordinate officers and clerks trained in English. Just as,in Muslim times, the Hindu desirous of [Page 482] governmentemployment was compelled to learn Persian, so now he had to learnEnglish. Middle class Hindu fathers began to send their sons to Europeanschools, despite the dangers of ritual impurity, and Western ideas began toaffect the well-to-do educated Indian.

The Portuguese had succeeded in “westernizing” many of their Indian and Sinhalese subjects, and to this day Indian blood flows in the veins of some old Portuguese families; a few Indians in the service of France cameto understand and admire the culture of their conquerors; but perhaps thefirst Indian to learn enough from the West to be able to hold his own withthe best minds of Europe, and yet still to love and respect his own culture,was the Bengali Ram Mohan Roy, the friend of Jeremy Bentham. RamMohan Roy, who was born in 1772 and died in England in 18S5, advocatedthe frank acceptance of all that Europe had to teach, and the sect whichlooked to him for inspiration, the Brahma Samaj, was in many ways closerto Christianity than to Hinduism. Never large in numbers, its influence waswidespread.

From the days of Ram Mohan Roy young Indians, at first very few, but soon in greater numbers, began to come to England for education. The littleband of Hindus educated on western lines, first in Bengal and then in otherparts of India, tended to go further in the rejection of their own culture thantheir descendants; they were fully conscious of the degeneracy which besettheir land, and many seem to have been rather ashamed of their Hindubackground. The Mutiny, which was fundamentally reactionary, found nosupport among the tiny westernized intelligentsia. The Universities ofCalcutta, Bombay and Madras, founded in 1857, the year of the Mutiny, atfirst paid scant attention to the ancient culture of India, but taught apredominantly Western curriculum through Western staff.

By the end of the 19th century, however, the situation had changed. Anew generation began to realize that Hindu culture had much of permanentvalue, and that the slavish imitation of the West could not solve India’sproblems. New organizations gave expression to this outlook. The AryaSamaj claimed to reform Hinduism by purging it of all later degeneratefeatures and by a return to the Vedas, very liberally interpreted, and hadconsiderable success. The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885,became the mouthpiece of Indian public opinion. Newspapers in Englishand the vernaculars multiplied.

Not only was Hindu culture largely rehabilitated in the eyes of intelligent Hindus, but it even began to make counter-propaganda. A few learned Europeans and Americans had long recognized the nobility of much ancient Indian religious thought. Now, through the [Page 483] TheosophicalSociety (which, despite its claim to represent the quintessence of allreligions, propagates a modernized Hinduism) and the RamakrishnaMission, the voice of Hinduism was heard in the West. Swāmī Vivekānanda(1862–1902), a splendid speaker of great spiritual power and personalmagnetism, preached Hinduism to large audiences in Europe and Americaand found willing hearers. Here and there Indians abjured the West root andbranch, and fanatically defended even those aspects of Hinduism which hadcompletely outlived their usefulness; but, despite these reactionaries, thenew Hinduism was very different from the old.

Rām Mohan Roy had sounded the theme with his passionate advocacy ofsocial reform; Vivekananda repeated it with a more nationalist timbre, whenhe declared that the highest form of service of the Great Mother was socialservice. Other great Indians, chief of whom was Mahatma Gandhi,developed the theme of social service as a religious duty, and thedevelopment continues under Gandhi’s successors.

Mahātmā Gāndhī was looked on by many, both Indian and European, as the epitome of Hindu tradition, but this is a false judgement for he was much influenced by Western ideas. Gandhi believed in the fundamentals of his ancient culture, but his passionate love of the underdog and hisantipathy to caste, though not unprecedented in ancient India, wereunorthodox in the extreme, and owed more to European 19th-centuryliberalism than to anything Indian. His faith in non-violence was, as wehave seen, by no means typical of Hinduism-his predecessor in revolt, theable Maratha brāhman B. G. Tilak, and Gāndhī’s impatient lieutenantSubhas Chandra Bose, were far more orthodox in this respect. For Gandhi’spacifism we must look to the Sermon on the Mount and to Tolstoy. Hischampioning of women’s rights is also the result of Western influence. Inhis social context he was always rather an innovator than a conservative.

Though some of his colleagues thought his programme of limited social reform too slow, he succeeded in shifting the whole emphasis of Hindu thought towards a popular and equalitarian social order, in place of thehierarchy of class and caste. Following up the work of many less well-known 19th-century reformers Gandhi and his followers of the IndianNational Congress have given new orientation and new life to Hinduculture, after centuries of stagnation.

Today there are few Indians, whatever their creed, who do not look back with pride on their ancient culture, and there are few intelligent Indians whoare not willing to sacrifice some of its effete elements that India maydevelop and progress. Politically and [Page 484] economically India facesmany problems of great difficulty, and no one can forecast her future withany certainty. But it is safe to predict that, whatever that future may be, the Indians of coming generations will not be unconvincing and self-consciouscopies of Europeans, but will be men rooted in their own traditions, andaware of the continuity of their culture. Already, after only seven years ofindependence, the extremes of national self-denigration and fanaticalcultural chauvinism are disappearing. We believe that Hindu civilization isin the act of performing its most spectacular feat of synthesis. In the past ithas received, adapted and digested elements of many different cultures-Indo-European, Mesopotamian, Iranian, Greek, Roman, Scythian, Turkish,Persian and Arab. With each new influence it has somewhat changed. Nowit is well on the way to assimilating the culture of the West.

Hindu civilization will, we believe, retain its continuity. The Bhagavad Gītā will not cease to inspire men of action, and the Upanisads men ofthought. The charm and graciousness of the Indian way of life willcontinue, however much affected it may be by the laboursaving devices ofthe West. People will still love the tales of the heroes of the Mahābhārataand the Rāmāyana, and of the loves of Dusyanta and Sakuntala and


Purūravas and Urvaśī. The quiet and gentle happiness which has at all times pervaded Indian life where oppression, disease and poverty have not overclouded it will surely not vanish before the more hectic ways of the West.

Much that was useless in ancient Indian culture has already perished. The extravagant and barbarous hecatombs of the Vedic age have long since been forgotten, though animal sacrifice continues in some sects. Widows havelong ceased to be burnt on their husbands’ pyres. Girls may not by law bemarried in childhood. In buses and trains all over India brāhmans rubshoulders with the lower castes without consciousness of grave pollution,and the temples are open to all by law. Caste is vanishing; the process beganlong ago, but its pace is now so rapid that the more objectionable features ofcaste may have disappeared within a generation or so. The old familysystem is adapting itself to present-day conditions. In fact the whole face ofIndia is altering, but the cultural tradition continues, and it will never belost.

## THE WORLD’S DEBT TO INDIA

We have said much about India’s debt to other cultures, but we must make it clear that she has given as much as or more than she has taken. Let us summarize the world’s debt to India.

[Page 485] The whole of South-East Asia received most of its culture from India. Early in the 5th century B.c. colonists from Western India settled in Ceylon, which was finally converted to Buddhism in the reign ofAśoka. By this time a few Indian merchants had probably found their wayto Malaya, Sumatra, and other parts of South-East Asia. Gradually theyestablished permanent settlements, often, no doubt, marrying nativewomen. They were followed by brāhmans and Buddhist monks, and Indianinfluence gradually leavened the indigenous culture, until, by the 4thcentury A.D., Sanskrit was the official language of the region, and therearose great civilizations, capable of organizing large maritime empires, andof building such wonderful memorials to their greatness as the Buddhiststūpa of Borobodūr in Java, or the Saivite temples of Angkor in Cambodia.

Other cultural influences, from China and the Islamic world, were felt in South-East Asia, but the primary impetus to civilization came from India.
Indian historians, proud of their country’s past, often refer to this regionas “Greater India”, and speak of Indian “colonies”. In its usual modernsense the term “colony” is hardly accurate, however.Vijaya, the legendaryĀryan conqueror of Ceylon, is said to have gained the island by the sword,but beyond this we have no real evidence of any permanent Indian conquestoutside the bounds of India. The Indian “colonies” were peaceful ones, andthe Indianized kings of the region were indigenous chieftains who hadlearnt what India had to teach them.

Northwards Indian cultural influence spread through Central Asia to China. Faint and weak contact between China and India was probably made in Mauryan times, if not before, but only when, some 2,000 years ago, the Han Empire began to drive its frontiers towards the Caspian did India andChina really meet. Unlike South-East Asia, China did not assimilate Indianideas in every aspect of her culture, but the whole of the Far East is inIndia’s debt for Buddhism, which helped to mould the distinctivecivilizations of China, Korea, Japan and Tibet.

As well as her special gifts to Asia, India has conferred many practical blessings on the world at large; notably rice, cotton, the sugar cane, manyspices, the domestic fowl, the game of chess (p. 208), and, most importantof all, the decimal system of numeral notation, the invention of an unknownIndian mathematician early in the Christian era (p. 495f). The extent of thespiritual influence of India on the ancient West is much disputed. Theheterodox Jewish sect of the Essenes, which probably influenced earlyChristianity, followed monastic practices in some respects similar to thoseof Buddhism. Parallels may be traced between passages in the NewTestament [Page 486] and the Pali scriptures. 1 Similarities between theteachings of western philosophers and mystics from Pythagoras to Plotinusand those of the Upanisads have frequently been noticed. None of thesesimilarities, however, is close enough to give certainty, especially as wehave no evidence that any classical writer had a deep knowledge of Indianreligion. We can only say that there was always some contact between theHellenic world and India, mediated first by the Achaemenid Empire, thenby that of the Seleucids, and finally, under the Romans, by the traders of theIndian ocean. Christianity began to spread at the time when this contact wasclosest. We know that Indian ascetics occasionally visited the West, and thatthere was a colony of Indian merchants at Alexandria. The possibility ofIndian influence on Neo-platonism and early Christianity cannot be ruledout.

Many authorities may doubt that Indian thought had any effect on that of the ancient West, but there can be no doubt of its direct and indirect influence on the thought of Europe and America in the last century and a half, though this has not received adequate recognition. This influence hasnot come by way of organized neo-Hindu missions. The last eighty yearshave seen the foundation of the Theosophical Society, of various Buddhistsocieties, and of societies in Europe and America looking for inspiration tothe saintly 19th-century Bengālī mystic, Paramahamsa Ramakrishna, andhis equally saintly disciple, Swāmī Vivekānanda. Lesser organizations andgroups have been founded in the West by other Indian mystics and theirdisciples, some of them noble, earnest and spiritual, others of more dubiouscharacter. Here and there Westerners themselves, sometimes armed with aworking knowledge of Sanskrit and first-hand Indian experience, have triedto convert the West to a streamlined Yoga or Vedanta. We would in no waydisparage these teachers or their followers, many of whom are of greatintellectual and spiritual calibre; but whatever we may think of the Westernpropagators of Indian mysticism, we cannot claim that they have had anygreat effect on our civilization. More subtle, but more powerful, has beenthe influence of Mahatma Gandhi, through the many friends of India in theWest who were impressed by his burning sincerity and energy, and by theultimate success of his policy of non-violence in achieving India’sindependence. Greater than any of these influences, however, has been theinfluence of ancient Indian religious literature through philosophy.

The pioneers of the Asiatic Society of Bengal quickly gained a small butenthusiastic following in Europe, and Goethe and many other writers of theearly 19th century read all they could of ancient Indian literature intranslation. We know that Goethe borrowed a device [Page 487] of Indiandramaturgy for the prologue to “Faust” (p. 433n), and who can say that thetriumphant final chorus of the second part of that work was not in partinspired by the monism of Indian thought as he understood it? From Goetheonwards most of the great German philosophers knew something of Indianphilosophy. Schopenhauer, whose influence on literature and psychologyhas been so considerable, indeed openly admitted his debt, and his outlookwas virtually that of Buddhism. The monisms of Fichte and Hegel mightnever have taken the forms they did if it had not been for Anquetil-Duperron’s translation of the Upanisads and the work of other pioneerIndologists. In the English-speaking world the strongest Indian influencewas felt in America, where Emerson, Thoreau and other New Englandwriters avidly studied much Indian religious literature in translation, andexerted immense influence on their contemporaries and successors, notablyWalt Whitman. Through Carlyle and others the German philosophers intheir turn made their mark on England, as did the Americans through manylate 19th-century writers such as Richard Jeffries and Edward Carpenter.

Though in the contemporary philosophical schools of Europe and America the monistic and idealist philosophies of the last century carry little weight, their influence has been considerable, and all of them owe something at least to ancient India. The sages who meditated in the jungles of the Ganges Valley six hundred years or more before Christ are still forces in the world.

It is today something of an anachronism to speak of European civilization or Indian civilization. Until very recently cultures were sharply divided, butnow, when India is but a thirty hours’ journey from London, culturaldivisions are beginning to disappear. If a modus vivendi is reached betweenliberal democracy and communism, and civilization survives, the world ofthe future will have a single culture with, it is to be hoped, many local differences and variations. India’s contribution to the world’s cultural stockhas already been very large, and it will continue and grow as, in her newfreedom, her prestige and influence increases. For this reason if for no otherwe must take account of her ancient heritage in its successes and itsfailures, for it is no longer the heritage of India alone, but of all mankind.

COSMOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY
[Page 488]
THE universe of the Vedas was a simple affair-a flat circular earth below, a
heaven above, through which sun, moon and stars moved, and between
them the middle air (antarzksa), the abode of birds, clouds and demigods.

This picture of the world was much complicated by later religious thought.

Indian ideas on the origin and evolution of the universe are rather a
matter of religion than of science and are considered elsewhere (p. 320ff).

All Indian religions, however, show certain concepts of cosmology incommon, which were fundamental presuppositions of Indian thought, andwere strikingly at variance with the Semitic ideas which long influenced thethinking of the West-the universe is very old; its evolution and decline arecyclic, repeated ad infinitum; it is immensely large; and there are otheruniverses beyond our own.

The Hindus believed that the universe was shaped like an egg-theBrahmānda, or Egg of Brahma-divided into twenty-one zones or regions, ofwhich the earth was seventh from the top. Above the earth were six heavens(not, as with the Greeks, associated with the planets), of increasingbeatitude. Below earth were the seven stages of Pātāla, the nether world,which were the abode of nagas and other mythical beings and were notthought of as in any way unpleasant. Below Patala lay Naraka, or purgatory,also divided into seven zones, which were of increasing misery, andinhabited by souls in torment. The universe hung in empty space, and wasvirtually isolated from other universes.The cosmic schemes of the Buddhists and Jainas differed from this inmany details, but in fundamentals were the same. All originally postulated aflat earth, but this was recognized by Indian astronomers to be incorrectearly in the Christian era, and, though the idea of a flat earth remained forreligious purposes, the learned realized, perhaps through the influence ofGreek astronomy, that it was in fact spherical. Various estimates of its sizewere made, the most popular being that of Brahmagupta (7th century A.D.),who gave its circumference as 5,000 yojanas. Assuming Brahmagupta’syojana to be the short league of about 4½ miles, this figure is not far out,and is as accurate as any given by ancient astronomers.

The modest spherical earth of the astronomers did not satisfy the
theologians, however, and even later religious literature described the earthas a flat disc of enormous size. In its centre was Mount Meru, round whichsun, moon and stars revolved. Around Meru were four continents (dvlpa),separated from the central peak by oceans, and named according to thegreat trees which stood on their shores opposite Meru. The southerncontinent, on which human beings dwell, had ajambu (rose-apple) as itsdistinctive tree, and it was therefore called Jambudvīpa. The southern zoneof this continent, [Page 489] separated from the rest by the Himalayas, was“the Land of the Sons of Bharata” (Bhratavarsa), or India. Bharatavarsaalone was 9,000 yojanas across, and the whole of Jambudvipa 33,000, or,according to some sources, 100,000 yojanas.

PLATE LXXXIX
This fantastic geographical scheme was not the only one. In the Puranas
Jambudvipa is described as a ring around Meru, separated from the nextcontinent, Plaksadvīpa, by an ocean of salt. Plaksadvīpa in turn forms aconcentric circle round Jambudvīpa, and so on to make a total of sevencontinents, each circular and divided from its neighbour by an ocean ofdifferent composition-starting with Jambudvipa’s salt ocean and movingoutwards, of treacle, wine, ghee, milk, curds and fresh water respectively.
This brilliantly imaginative picture of the world, which aroused the scorn ofLord Macaulay, seems to have been implicitly believed in by later Hindutheologians, and even the astronomers could not emancipate themselvesfrom it, but adapted it to their spherical earth by making Meru the earth’saxis, and the continents zones on the earth’s surface.

The oceans of butter and seas of treacle formed an effective barrier to the growth of a true science of geography. The seven continents cannot in any way have been related to actual portions of the earth’s surface, though some modem students have tried to identify them with parts of Asia, and, as far asis known, no attempt was made to collate the experience of travellers aspractical geography. The astronomers gave fairly accurate longitudes ofimportant places in India. In the early centuries of the Christian eraAlexandria was known, and there are vague references to the city of theRomakas in astronomical works; but the geographical knowledge of thelearned was of the vaguest description. Even within India distances anddirections, as given in texts, are usually very inaccurate and vague. Theconquerors who led armies thousands of miles on their campaigns, themerchants who carried their wares from one end of India to the other, andthe pilgrims who visited sacred places from the Himalayas to CapeComorin must have had a sound practical knowledge of Indian geography,while that of the seamen who sailed the ocean from Socotra to Canton musthave been even wider; but there are few echoes of this knowledge in theliterature of the time.



# APPENDIX II
## ASTRONOMY
One of the subsidiary studies (vedānga) of Vedic lore was jyotisa, aprimitive astronomy designed mainly for the purpose of settling the datesand times at which periodical sacrifices were to be performed. The existingliterature on this topic is comparatively late, and gives no true indication ofIndia’s astronomical knowledge in the Vedic period, though it is quite clear[Page 490] from passages in the Vedic texts themselves that it was adequatefor the practical purposes of the time. It is probable that even at this earlyperiod there was some Mesopotamian influence on Indian astronomicalideas, but this cannot be established with certainty. Virtually certain,however, is the influence of classical European astronomy, whichwasfeltin the early centuries of the Christian era, if not before.Several Greek words have become common in Sanskrit and in laterIndian vernaculars through astronomy (p. 230), and other technical terms,not so widely known, are indisputably of Greek origin. Of the fiveastronomical systems (siddhanta) known to the 6th-century astronomerVarahamihira one is called the Romaka Siddhdnta and another the PaulidaSiddhanta, a title which can only be reasonably explained as a recollectionof the name of the classical astronomer Paul of Alexandria.
The new astronomy was adopted chiefly for purposes of prognostication;for the establishment of dates the old luni-solar calendar, based on simplerobservations, was quite adequate. In earlier times Indians, though no lessinterested than other ancient peoples in foretelling the future, preferred todo so by the interpretation of dreams and omens (utpāta), and byphysiognomy, birthmarks, the shape and size of the features, and other signswhich were believed to give tokens of an individual’s fate. The oldersystems of prognostication were not forgotten, but from Gupta timesonwards they gave pride of place to astrology, which from that day to thishas been implicitly believed in by nearly all Indians.Until this great development of astronomical knowledge the heavens hadbeen charted by means of the lunar mansions or naksatras, which wereapparently known even in the time of the Rg Veda. The moon’s relation tothe fixed stars changes through a cycle of approximately 27 solar days and71 hours, and thus the heavens were divided into 27 portions, namedaccording to the group of stars on the ecliptic (the apparent orbit of the sun)near which the moon passes on each day of its cycle. As the sidereal monthis in fact nearly eight hours more than 27 days a twenty-eighth intercalarynaksatra was added by later astronomers to correct the error. 1Western astronomy brought to India the signs of the zodiac, the sevendayweek, the hour, and several other ideas. Thanks to their achievements [Page491] in mathematics Indian astronomers made some advances on theknowledge of the Greeks, and passed their lore, with that of mathematics,back to Europe by way of the Arabs. As early as the 7th century the Syrianastronomer Severus Sebokht knew of the greatness of Indian astronomy andmathematics (p. vi), and the caliphs of Baghdad employed Indianastronomers. One word of the terminology of medieval Europeanastronomy, aux, the highest point of a planet’s orbit, is certainly borrowedfrom the Sanskrit ucca through Arabic.

Like all ancient astronomy, that of India was restricted owing toignorance of the telescope; but methods of observation were perfectedwhich allowed very accurate measurement, and calculations were aided bythe decimal system of numerals. We know of no remains of observatories ofthe Hindu period, but those of the 17th and 18th centuries, at Jaipur, Delhiand elsewhere, with their wonderfully accurate instruments, constructed onan enormous scale to minimize error, may well have had their ancientcounterparts.

With the naked eye as their sole means of observation the Indians knew
only the seven planets (graha) of the ancients-Sun (SiSrya, Ravi), Moon(Candra, Soma), Mercury (Budha), Venus (Sukra), Mars (Mangala), Jupiter(Brhaspati) and Saturn (Śani);2 to these grahas two more were added, Rdhuand Ketu, the ascending and descending nodes of the moon. 3 At thebeginning of each æon all the planets were believed to commence theirrevolutions in line, and to return to the same position at the end of it. Theapparently irregular course of the planets was explained on the hypothesisof epicycles, as in classical and medieval astronomy. Unlike the Greeks, theIndians believed that the planets had equal real motion, and that theirapparently different angular motion was due to their different distancesfrom the earth.
For purposes of calculation the planetary system was taken as geocentric,though Aryabhata in the 5th century suggested that the earth revolved roundthe sun and rotated on its axis; this theory was also known to laterastronomers, but it never affected astronomical practice. The precession ofthe equinoxes was known, and calculated with some accuracy by medievalastronomers, as were the lengths of the year, the lunar month, and otherastronomical constants. These calculations were reliable for most practicalpurposes, and in many cases more accurate than those of the Greco-Romanworld. Eclipses were forecast with accuracy and their true causeunderstood.



# APPENDIX III
## THE CALENDAR
[Page 492] In recording dates the basic unit was not the solar day, but the
tithi, or lunar day, approximately thirty of which formed a lunar month (i.e.

the four phases of the moon) of about 291 solar days. The month was
divided into two halves ( paksa) of fifteen tithis each, beginning with the full
( pirnimdvdsyd) and new (amāvāsyā or bahuliāvsyā) moons respectively.

The fortnight beginning with the new moon was called the bright half(iuklapaksa) and the other the dark half (krsnapaksa). According to thesystem followed in Northern India and much of the Deccan the monthbegan and ended with the full moon, while in the Tamil country the monthgenerally began with the new moon. The Hindu calendar is still in usethroughout India for religious purposes.
The tithi might begin at any time of the solar day. For the practicalpurpose of recording dates that tithi current at sunrise was supposed toprevail for the whole day and gave that day its number in the paksa. If atithi began just after sunrise and ended before the sunrise of the next day, itwas expunged, and there was a break in the numerical sequence of days.

The year normally contained twelve lunar months: Caitra (March-April),Vaiśkha (April-May), Jyaistha (May-June),. Āsādha (June-July), Śrva (July-August), Bhādrapada or Prausthapada (August-September), Āsvina orĀsvayuja (September-October), Kārttika (October-November), Mārgasā orĀgrahāyana (November-December), Pausa or Taisa (December-January),Māgha (January-February) and Phālguna (February-March).4 According tothe usual systems of reckoning the year began with Caitra, but it wassometimes taken as beginning with Karttika or another month.

A group of two months formed a season (rtu). The six seasons of the
Indian year were: Vasanta (Spring, March-May), Grīsma (Summer, May–
July),
Varsā
(The
Rains,
July-September),
Sarad
(Autumn,
SeptemberNovember), Hemanta (Winter, November-January) and Sisira
(the Cool Season, January-March).

Twelve lunar months make only about 354 days, and the problem of the discrepancy between the lunar and solar years was solved very early; sixty- two lunar months are approximately equal to sixty solar months, and so every thirty months an extra month was added to the year, as in Babylonia.

This leap-month was generally inserted after Āsādha or Śrāvana and called second (dvitiya) Āsādha or Śravana. Thus every second or third year contains thirteen months, and is some twenty-nine days longer than the others.

[Page 493] The Hindu calendar, though quite efficient, is thus rather cumbrous, and is so different from the solar calendar that it is impossible to reduce dates from one to the other without very complicated calculations or lengthy tables. It is even impossible to establish at a glance the month in which a given Hindu date falls with any certainty.

Indian dates are usually given in the order-month, paksa, tithi, the abbreviations sudi and badi being used for the bright and dark halves of the month; e.g. Caitra sudi 7 means the seventh day from the new moon of the month Caitra.

The solar calendar, imported with Western astronomy, was also known from Gupta times onwards though it did not oust the old luni-solar calendar until recent years. Where solar dates are given in early records they are usually mentioned for extra accuracy, with the prevailing naksatra of the day in question, after the regular luni-solar date. In the solar calendar themonths are named after the signs of the zodiac, which are literal or nearlyexact translations of their Greek originals: Mesa (Aries), Vrsabha (Taurus),Mithuna (Gemini), Karkata (Cancer), Sizmha (Leo), Kanyd (Virgo), Tula(Libra), Vrścika (Scorpio), Dhanus (Sagittarius), Makara (Capricornus),Kumbha (Aquarius) and Mzna (Pisces). With the solar calendar the seven-day week was also introduced, the days being named after their presidingplanets as in the Greco-Roman system: Ravivara (Sunday), Somavāra(Monday), Mangalavāra (Tuesday), Budhavāra (Wednesday), Brhaspativāra(Thursday), ukravāra (Friday) and Śanivāra (Saturday).

## ERAS
Until the 1st century B.C. there is no good evidence that India had anyregular system of recording the year of an event by dating in a definite eralike the A.U.C. of Rome or the Christian era of medieval and modernEurope. Early inscriptions are dated if at all in the regnal year of the rulingking. The idea of dating over a long period of time from a fixed year wasalmost certainly introduced into India by the invaders of the North-West,who have left the earliest inscriptions thus dated in India. Unfortunately theIndians did not adopt a uniform era, and a number of systems of datingwere in use from that time onwards, the chief of which, in order ofimportance, are as follows:

The Vikrama Era (58 B.C.), traditionally founded by a king calledVikramaditya, who drove the Sakas out of Ujjayini and founded the era tocelebrate his victory. The only king who both took the title Vikramadityaand drove the Sakas from Ujjayini was Candra Gupta II, who lived over400 years later than the beginning of the Vikrama era, and so the legend iscertainly false. In the earliest inscriptions using this era, all from WesternIndia, it is called simply Krta (” established”), or “handed down by theMalava tribe “. Some authorities believe that many inscriptions of the Sakas[Page 494] and Pahlavas of North-West India are to be read in this era, andthat it was founded by Azes, one of their early kings; but this is by nomeans certain. This era was most popular in North India. Its year beganoriginally with the month KIrttika, but by medieval times Vikrama yearsbegan in the bright half of Caitra in the North, and in the dark half of thesame month in the Peninsula.

The Saka Era (A.D. 78) was, according to tradition, founded by a Saka king who occupied Ujjayini 137 years after Vikramaditya. This era may in fact have been founded by Kaniska, and was certainly used early in the 2nd century A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence the use of the era spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East Asia.

The Gupta Era (A.D. 320) was probably founded by Candra Gupta I, and its use was continued by the Maitraka dynasty of Gujarat for some centuries after the Gupta empire fell.

TheHarsa Era (A.D. 606), founded by Harsavardhana of Kanyakubja, was popular in Northern India for a century or two after his death.

The Kalacuri Era (A.D. 248), perhaps founded by a small dynasty called
the Traikutaka, was current in Central India down to the Muslim invasion.
Other eras of local or temporary importance were the Laksmana Era ofBengal (A.D. 1119), wrongly said to have been founded by King LaksmanaSena; the Saptarsi or Laukika Era, current in Kashmār in the Middle Ages,and recorded in cycles of one hundred years, each cycle commencingseventysix years after each Christian century; the Licchavi and Nevar Erasof Nepal (A.D. 110 and 878); the Kollam Era of Malabar (A.D. 825); and theEra of Vikramaditya VI Cdlukya (A.D. 1075). The Era of the Kaliyuga (3102B.C., v. p. 39 above) was often used for religious dates and rarely forpolitical. In Ceylon a Buddha Era from 544 B.C. was in use from anuncertain date, when it probably replaced an earlier reckoning from 483 B.C.

The Jainas used an Era of Mahdvmra, reckoned from 628 B.C. The two latter eras, together with the Vikrama and Saka Eras, are still in use for religious purposes, but the others are extinct.

In reducing dates in Indian eras to the Christian era it must beremembered that the year, according to most reckonings, begins with themonth of Caitra, which usually commences in the middle of March. Thusthe months Magha and Phalguna, and generally the second half of Pausa,occur in the Christian year after that in which the Hindu year began. Dateswere usually given in expired years; this was sometimes explicitly stated(e.g. “when 493 years had passed from the establishment of the tribe of theMalavas”), but more often taken for granted. In medieval dates it is best toassume an expired year, even when this is not specified, unless there isspecial reason to believe otherwise.

The following table will be useful for reducing Indian dates to the
Christian era:

# APPENDIX IV
## MATHEMATICS
Through the necessity of accurately laying out the open-air site of a
sacrifice Indians very early evolved a simple system of geometry, but in the
sphere of practical knowledge the world owes most to India in the realm ofmathematics, which were developed in Gupta times to a stage moreadvanced than that reached by any other nation of antiquity. The success ofIndian mathematics was mainly due to the fact that the Indians had a clearconception of abstract number, as distinct from numerical quantity ofobjects or spatial extension. While Greek mathematical science was largelybased on mensuration and geometry, India transcended these conceptionsquite early, and, with the aid of a simple numeral notation, devised arudimentary algebra which allowed more complicated calculations thanwere possible to the Greeks, and led to the study of number for its ownsake.

In the earlier inscriptions of India dates and other numerals are written in a notation not unlike that of the Romans, Greeks and Hebrews, with separate symbols for the tens and hundreds. The earliest inscription recording the date by a system of nine digits and a zero, with place notation for the tens and hundreds, comes from Gujarat, and is dated A.D. 595.5 Soonafter this however, the new system had been heard of in Syria (p. vi), 6 andwas being used as far afield as Indo-China. Evidently the system was in useamong mathematicians some centuries before it was employed ininscriptions, the scribes of which tended to be conservative in their systemof [Page 496] recording dates; in modem Europe the cumbrous Romansystem is still sometimes used for the same purpose. The name of themathematician who devised the simplified system of writing numerals isunknown, but the earliest surviving mathematical texts-the anonymous“Bakshali Manuscript”, which is a copy of a text of the 4th century A.D., andthe terse Jryabhatzya of Aryabhata, written in A.D. 499-presuppose it.

For long it was thought that the decimal system of numerals was inventedby the Arabs, but this is certainly not the case. The Arabs themselves calledmathematics “the Indian (art)” (hindisat), and there is now no doubt that thedecimal notation, with other mathematical lore, was learnt by the Muslimworld either through merchants trading with the west coast of India, orthrough the Arabs who conquered Sind in A.D. 712.

The debt of the Western world to India in this respect cannot beoverestimated. Most of the great discoveries and inventions of whichEurope is so proud would have been impossible without a developed systemof mathematics, and this in turn would have been impossible if Europe hadbeen shackled by the unwieldy system of Roman numerals. The unknownman who devised the new system was from the world’s point of view, afterthe Buddha, the most important son of India. His achievement, thougheasily taken for granted, was the work of an analytical mind of the firstorder, and he deserves much more honour than he has so far received.

Medieval Indian mathematicians, such as Brahmagupta (7th century), Mahavira (9th century) and Bhaskara (l2th century), made several discoveries which in Europe were not known until the Renaissance or later.

They understood the import of positive and negative quantities, evolvedsound systems of extracting square and cube roots, and could solvequadratic and certain types of indeterminate equations. For iT Aryabhatagave the usual modern approximate value of 3 1416, expressed in the formof a fractionThis value of rr, much more accurate than that of theGreeks, was improved to nine places of decimals by later Indianmathematicians. Some steps were made in trigonometry, spherical geometryand calculus, chiefly in connexion with astronomy. The mathematicalimplications of zero (sUnya) and infinity, never more than vaguely realizedby classical authorities, were fully understood in medieval India. Earliermathematicians had taught that, but Bhaskara proved that it wasinfinity. He also established mathematically what had been recognized inIndian theology at least a millenium earlier, that infinity, however divided,remains infinite, represented by the equation


# APPENDIX V
## PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
Ancient Indian ideas of physics were closely linked with religion and theology, and differed somewhat from sect to sect. As early as the time of the Buddha, if not before, the universe was classified by elements, of which[Page 497] all schools admitted at least four-earth, air, fire and water. Tothese orthodox Hindu schools and Jainism added a fifth, dkda, which isgenerally translated “ether”. It was recognized that air was not of infiniteextension, and the Indian mind, with its abhorrence of a vacuum, found ithard to conceive of empty space. The five elements were thought of as themediums of sense impressions-earth of smell, air of feeling, fire of vision,water of taste, and ether of sound. Buddhists and Ajivikas rejected ether, butthe latter added life, joy and sorrow, which were thought of as in some waymaterial, making a total of seven elements.

Most schools believed that the elements other than ether were atomic.

Indian atomism was certainly independent of Greek influence, for an atomictheory was taught by Pakudha Katyayana, an older contemporary of theBuddha, and was therefore earlier than that of Democritus. The Jainasbelieved that all atoms (anu) were identical, and that differences of thecharacter of the elements were due to the manner in which the atoms werecombined. Most schools, however, maintained that there were as manytypes of atom as there were elements.

The atom was generally thought to be eternal, but some Buddhists conceived of it not only as the minutest object capable of occupying space, but also as occupying the minutest possible duration of time, coming into being and vanishing almost in an instant, only to be succeeded by anotheratom, caused by the first. Thus the atom of Buddhism in some measureresembles the quantum of Planck. The atom was quite invisible to thehuman eye; the orthodox Vaisesika school believed the single atom to be amere point in space, completely without magnitude.

A single atom had no qualities, but only potentialities, which came into play when the atom combined with others. The Vaisesika school, which specially elaborated atomic doctrines, and was the school of atomism par excellence, maintained that, before combining to form material objects, atoms made primary combinations of diads and triads. This doctrine of molecules was developed differently by Buddhists and Ajivikas, who taughtthat in normal conditions no atoms existed in a pure state, but onlycombined in different proportions in a molecule (samgh.dta, kalapa). Everymolecule contained at least one atom of all four types, and obtained itscharacter from the predominance of a given element. This hypothesisaccounted for the fact that matter might show characteristics of more thanone element: thus wax might melt and also burn, because its moleculescontained proportions of water and fire. According to the Buddhists themolecules cohered by virtue of the atoms of water in each, which acted asadhesive.

Indian atomic theories were not based so much on experiment, as on intuition and logic. They were not universally held. The great theologian Safikara (p. 328) did not believe in atoms and argued strongly against their existence. But the atomic theories of ancient India are brilliant imaginative explanations of the physical structure of the world; though it is probably mere coincidence that they agree in part with the theories of modem physics, they are nevertheless much to the credit of the intellect and imagination of early Indian thinkers.

[Page 498] Beyond this ancient Indian physics developed little. Without knowledge of an all-embracing law of gravity it remained in a rudimentary state, like all the physical systems of the ancient world. It was generally believed that the elements of earth and water tended to fall, and fire to rise, and it was recognized that solids and fluids alike generally expanded onheating, but no serious effort was made to study such phenomenaexperimentally. In the science of acoustics, however, India made realdiscoveries based on experiment, and the ear, highly trained by the phoneticstudy necessary for the correct recitation of the Vedas, learned todistinguish musical tones far closer than those of other early musicalsystems. Before the Christian era the octave was divided into twenty-twosrutis, or quarter-tones (p. 382), and their proportions were measured withgreat accuracy. It was recognized that differences of timbre were caused byovertones (anuranana), which varied with different instruments.

We know from the evidence of the Iron Pillar of Delhi (p. 219 f) and other sources that Indian metallurgists Śained great proficiency in the extraction of metal from ore and in metal-casting, and their products were known and valued in the Roman Empire and the Middle East; but their knowledge appears to have been largely pragmatic, and had no counterpartin a highly developed science of metallurgy. Chemistry in ancient India wasthe handmaid, not of technology, but of medicine; her chemists did notshare the interest of medieval Europe in transmuting base metal into gold,but apparently devoted most of their attention to making medicines, drugsto promote longevity, aphrodisiacs, poisons, and their antidotes. Thesemedical chemists did succeed in producing many important alkalis, acidsand metallic salts by simple processes of calcination and distillation, and ithas even been suggested, without good basis, that they discovered a form ofgunpowder.

In the Middle Ages Indian chemists, like their counterparts in China, the Muslim World and Europe, became engrossed in the study of mercury, perhaps through contact with the Arabs. A school of alchemists arose, who experimented with the wonderful fluid metal, and decided that it was thespecific for all diseases, the source of perpetual youth, and even the surestmeans to salvation. In this infatuation with mercury Indian chemistryfoundered, but not before it had passed many ideas on to the Arabs, whogave them to medieval Europe.


# APPENDIX VI
## PHYSIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
The Vedas show a very primitive stage of medical and physiological lore,but the basic textbooks of Indian medicine-the compendia of Caraka (lst-2nd centuries A.D.) and Sufruta (c. 4th century A.D.)-are the products [Page499] of a fully evolved system which resembles those of Hippocrates andGalen in some respects, and in others has developed beyond them. We haveno medical texts of the intervening period, but there is little doubt that twofactors encouraged medical knowledge-the growth of interest in physiologythrough the phenomena of yoga and mystical experience, and Buddhism.

Like the Christian missionary of later times the Buddhist monk often served as a doctor among the layfolk from whom he begged his food; moreover he was encouraged to care for his own health and that of his fellow-monks,and his creed tended towards rationalism and a distrust of the medicalmagic of earlier times. The development of medicine was also probablystimulated by contact with Hellenic physicians, and the resemblancesbetween Indian and classical medicine suggest borrowing on both sides.

After Susruta Indian medicine developed little, except in the growing use of mercurial drugs, and of others such as opium and sarsaparilla, which were introduced by the Arabs. In its essentials the system practised by the ayurvedic physician of present day India remains the same.

The basic conception of Indian medicine, like that of ancient and medieval Europe, was the humours (dosa). Most authorities taught that health was maintained through the even balance of the three vital fluids of the body-wind, gall and mucus, to which some added blood as a fourth humour. The three primary humours were connected with the scheme of the three gunas, or universal qualities (p. 324 f), and associated with virtue, passion and dullness respectively.

The bodily functions were maintained by the five “winds” (vdyu): udana, emanating from the throat, and causing speech; prana, in the heart, and responsible for breathing and the swallowing of food; samana, fanning the fire in the stomach which “cooked” or digested the food, and dividing it into its digestible and indigestible parts; apana in the abdomen, andresponsible for excretion and procreation; and vyana, a generally diffusedwind, causing the motion of the blood and of the body generally. The fooddigested by the samana became chyle, which proceeded to the heart, andthence to the liver, where its essence was converted into blood. The blood inturn was in part converted into flesh and the process was continued throughthe series fat, bone, marrow and semen; the latter, when not expelled,produced energy (ojas), which returned to the heart and was thence diffusedover the body. This process of metabolism was believed to take place inthirty days.

Ancient Indian doctors had no clear knowledge of the function of the brain, and believed with most ancient peoples that the heart was the seat of intelligence. They realized, however, the importance of the spinal cord (p.

326 f), and knew of the existence of the nervous system, though it was not properly understood. The progress of physiology and biology was impeded by the taboo on contact with dead bodies, which much discouraged dissection and the study of anatomy, although such practices were not completely unknown.

Despite their inaccurate knowledge of physiology, which was by no means inferior to that of most ancient peoples, India evolved a developed empirical surgery. The caesarian section was known, bone-setting reached a high [Page 500] degree of skill, and plastic surgery was developed far beyond anything known elsewhere at the time. Ancient Indian surgeonswere expert at the repair of noses, ears and lips, lost or injured in battle orby judicial mutilation. In this respect Indian surgery remained ahead ofEuropean until the 18th century, when the surgeons of the East IndianCompany were not ashamed to learn the art of rhinoplasty from the Indians.

Though Indians very early conceived of the existence of microscopic
forms of life, it was never realized that these might cause diseases; but if
Indian surgeons had no true idea of antisepsis or asepsis they encouraged
scrupulous cleanliness as they understood it, and recognized the therapeutic value of fresh air and light. The pharmacopoeia of ancient India was verylarge, and comprised animal, vegetable and mineral products. Many Asiaticdrugs were known and used long before their introduction into Europe,notably the oil of the chaulmugra tree, traditionally prescribed as a specificfor leprosy, and still the basis of the modern treatment of the disease.

The physician was a highly respected member of society, and the vaidyas
rank high in the caste hierarchy to this day. The rules of professionalbehaviour laid down in medical texts remind us of those of Hippocrates andare not unworthy of the conscientious doctor of any place or time. We quotepart of the sermon which Caraka instructs a physician to preach to hispupils at a solemn religious ceremony to be performed on the completion oftheir apprenticeship.

“If you want success in your practice, wealth and fame, and heaven after
your death, you must pray every day on rising and going to bed for thewelfare of all beings, especially of cows and brahmans, and you must strivewith all your soul for the health of the sick. You must not betray yourpatients, even at the cost of your own life. …. You must not get drunk, orcommit evil, or have evil companions. … You must be pleasant of speech… and thoughtful, always striving to improve your knowledge.

“When you go to the home of a patient you should direct your words,
mind, intellect and senses nowhere but to your patient and his treatment. ….

Nothing that happens in the house of the sick man must be told outside, nor
must the patient’s condition be told to anyone who might do harm by that
knowledge to the patient or to another.” 7
Under the patronage of the more benevolent kings and religious foundationsfree medical aid was given to the poor. AMoka took pride in the fact that hehad provided medicines for man and beast, and the traveller Fa-hsien, in theearly 5th century A.D., made special note of the free hospitals maintained bythe donations of pious citizens. Unfortunately we have no detaileddescriptions of such establishments.

Veterinary medicine was also practised. The doctrine of non-violenceencouraged the endowment of animal refuges and homes for sick and agedanimals, and such charities are still maintained in many cities of India. Thehorse and elephant doctors were members of skilled and respectedprofessions, much in demand at court, and texts on veterinary sciencesurvive from the Middle Ages.


# APPENDIX VII
## LOGIC AND EPISTEMOLOGY
[Page 501] With such an intense interest in metaphysical problems and atradition of lively debate and discussion it is not surprising that Indiadeveloped her own distinctive system of logic. The basic logical text is theNyaya Sātras of Gautama, perhaps composed in the early centuries of theChristian era, a series of brief aphorisms much commented on by laterwriters, and the foundation-text of the Nyaya, one of the six schools oforthodox philosophy (p. 323). Logic was not, however, confined to this oneschool, but was utilized and adapted by Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina alike.

One of the most important topics of Indian thought in this field was the
question of pramdna, which may be translated “means of reliable knowledge’8. According to the later Nyaya schools there were four pramanas, perception (pratyaksa), inference (anumdna), inference byanalogy or comparison (upamdna), and “word” (6abda), the pronouncementof a reliable authority, such as the Vedas. The Vedanta school addedintuition or presumption (arthdpatti) and non-perception (anupalabdhi), thelatter an unnecessary scholastic refinement. The six categories overlappedsomewhat, and the Buddhists generally included all forms of knowledgeunder the first two categories, while the Jainas usually allowed only three,perception, inference and revelation. The materialists allowed onlyperception, and their opponents made short work of their efforts at provingby inference that inference could not give reliable knowledge.

It was probably in the study of the process of inference that schools oftrue logic arose. From the necessities of metaphysical discussion falsearguments were analysed and classified; of these logicians recognized thechief fallacies of classical logic, such as reductio ad absurdum(arthaprasanga), circular argument (cakra), infinite regression (anavasthd),dilemma (anyonyairaya), and ignoratio elenchi (atmdsraya).

A correct inference was established by syllogism, of which the Indianform (paicdvayava) was somewhat more cumbrous than the Aristotelian. Itsfive members were known as proposition (pratijia), reason (hetu), example(uddharana), application (upanaya) and conclusion (nigamana). Theclassical Indian example may be paraphrased as follows:
(1) There is fire on the mountain,
(2) because there is smoke above it,
(3) and where there is smoke there is fire, as, for instance, in a kitchen;
(4) such is the case with the mountain,
(5) and therefore there is fire on it.

The third term of the Indian syllogism corresponds to the major premiss
of that of Aristotle, the second to Aristotle’s minor premiss, and the first to his conclusion. Thus the Indian syllogism reversed the order of that ofclassical logic, the argument being stated in the first and second [Page 502]clauses, established by the general rule and example in the third, and finallyclinched by the virtual repetition of the first two clauses. The “example” (inthe above syllogism the kitchen) was generally looked on as an essentialpart of the argument, and helped to strengthen its rhetorical force. Evidentlythis elaborate system of syllogism is the outcome of much practicalexperience in discussion. Three-membered syllogisms were admitted by theBuddhists, who rightly rejected the fourth and fifth members of theorthodox syllogism as tautological.
The basis of the generalization (for example “where there is smoke thereis fire”) on which every inference rests was believed to be the’quality ofuniversal concomitance (vydpti). The nature and origin of this quality wasmuch discussed, and its consideration led to theories of universals andparticulars, which are too recondite for consideration in this book.

No treatment of Indian thought is complete without a brief reference to
the remarkable epistemological relativity of Jainism. Jaina thinkers, andsome other heterodox teachers also, explicitly rejected what in classicallogic is called the law of the excluded middle. For the Jaina there were notmerely the two possiblities of existence and non-existence, but seven. Thuswe may affirm (1) that an object, say a knife, exists as a knife. We mayfurther say (2) that it is not something else, say a fork. But it exists as aknife and does not exist as a fork, and so we may declare of it (s) that in oneaspect it is and in another it is not. From another point of view (4) it isindescribable; its ultimate essence is unknown to us and we cannot positanything final about it-it is inexpressible. By combining this fourthpossiblitywith the three former ones we obtain three further possibilities ofpredication-(5) it is, but its nature is otherwise indescribable, (6) it is not,but its nature isindescribable,and(7)itbothisand is not, but its nature isindescribable. This system of seven aspects of predication is known assyadvada (“the doctrine of ‘maybe’”), or saptabhangi (“the sevenfolddivision”). 9As well as syadvada the Jainas had another sevenfold system ofpredication known as nayavdda, the theory of standpoints, or ways ofapproaching an object of observation or study. The first three of these areconnected with the object itself (dravydrthika), and the latter four with itsmodifications and the words used to describe it (parydydrthika). (1) Amango tree may be considered simultaneously as an individual having adefinite size and shape and as a member of the species “mango tree”; (2) itmay be treated merely as a representative of the “universal” mango tree,and as corresponding to the general concept of a mango tree, without takingits individual qualities into account; or (s) it may be considered merely asan individual, without taking note of its specific qualities. Further it may bethought of (4) as it is at the present moment, for instance as bearing ripefruit, without any regard to its past as a sapling or its future as firewood. (5)We may think of it from the point of view of its name “mango”, consideringall the [Page 503] synonyms of that name, and their implications. Thesesynonyms may be subtly differentiated, and (6) we may consider theirnuances and connotations. Finally (7) we may consider an object in itsrelation to a given epithet; thus by referring to a hero as a “lion” wementally abstract all his unlionlike qualities, and think of him only as abeing of strength and courage.10 Some Jaina schools rejected the last threestandpoints, which are hardly consistent with the first four, being rathersemantic in character than epistemological.

Modern logicians might make short work of these rather pedanticsystems of ontological and epistemological relativity, but they have afundamental quality of breadth and realism, implying a full realization thatthe world is more complex and subtle than we think it, and that what is trueof a thing in one of its aspects may at the same time be false in another.

# APPENDIX VIII
## WEIGHTS AND MEASURES

MEASURES OF WEIGHT
The basic weight of ancient India was the raktikd, the bright red seed of the gunja (abrus precatorius), which was conventionally reckoned at about 1.83 grains (.118 grams). Many sources give series of weights rising from this, which are not wholly consistent, and show that standards varied very widely with time and place.

The goldsmith’s scale given by Manu, which was probably the most widely followed, was:
5 raktikds = 1 mdsa,
16 mdsas = 1 karsa, tolaka, or suvarna,
4 karsas = 1 pala,
10 palas = 1 dharana.

The weight of the pala was thus approximately 1j oz., or 37–76 gms. Of heavier weights the chief were the prastha, usually given as of 16 palas, and the drona of 16 prasthas. The prastha was thus approximately 21 oz., and the drona 21¼ lb.

MEASURES OF LENGTH
The commonest table, omitting microscopic measurements, was:
8 yava (barleycorns) = 1 angula (finger’s breadth, I in.)

12 ahgulas =
1 vztasti (span, 9 ins.)

2 vitastis =
1 hasta or aratni (cubit, 18 ins.)

4 hastas =
1 daynda (rod) or dhanus (bow, 6 ft.)

2,000 dhanus =
1 krosa (cry) or goruta (cow-call, 2j miles)
4 kroias =
1 yojana (stage, 9 miles approx.).

[Page 504] Though most sources give the krosa (in modern Indian languages kos) as of 2,000 dandas the Arthas’stra gives it as of only 1,000, the yojana, which was the commonest measure of long distances in ancient India, being thus of only 41 miles. It is therefore clear that there were at least two yojanas, and distances as given in texts are thus very unreliable. It would seem that for practical purposes the shorter yojana was more often used than the longer, especially in earlier times.



MEASURES OF TIME
Ancient Indian learned men devised a detailed terminology for minute intervals of time, which had little relation to everyday life and must be looked on as a flight of fancy. The longer measurements in most general use were:
18 nimesas (winks) = 1 kdsthd ( secs.),
30 kdsthas =
1 kala ( mins.)

15 kalds =
1 nd.dikd or ndlikd (24 mins.)

30 kales or 2 nddikds = 1 muhirta or ksaza (48 mins.)

30 muhurtas =
1 aho-rdtra (day and night, 24 hours).

A measurement frequently used, but not consistent with this system, was the ydma or watch, one-eighth of a day and night, or three hours. In some sources, however, the ydma is given as three muhurtas, or one-tenth of a day and night. The hour (hord) was introduced from the West in the Gupta period and was used in astronomy, but was not widely employed in everyday life.

For longer measures of time see p. 492 ff.

# APPENDIX IX
## COINAGE11

EARLY PUNCH MARKED COINS
Uninscribed punchmarked coins were minted from the 6th century B.C.

onwards, and were in circulation for many centuries. Among the earliest silver specimens are those in the shape of a small bent bar, the largest of which, the satamdna, weighed 180 grains. Half, quarter and half-quarter satamdnas are attested.

The basic silver punchmarked coin of the usual type was the kdr.sdpana or pana, of 6578 grains. The mdsa or mdsika weighed one-sixteenth of this, or 3.6 grains. Various intermediate weights are attested, as well as large silver coins of so and 20 mdsas and small half-mdsa pieces.

Punchmarked copper coins were generally based on a different standard —a māsa of 9 grains and a kdrsdpana of 144. Quarter-mdsas in copper, or [Page 505] kdkinis (2.25 grains) are attested, as well as large coins of 20, so and 45 copper masas.

Only one gold punchmarked coin is known, and it must be assumed that gold was very rarely minted before the beginning of the Christian era.

## INDO-GREEK COINS
The earlier Greek kings minted coins according to the Attic standard, based on the drachm of 67.2 grains and the obol (6 drachm) of 11 2 grains.

Silver coinage of this type ranges from hemiobols to the very large double decadrachms, struck by a king Amyntas, which have recently been found in Afghanistan. After their southward expansion the Greeks adopted a reduced weight, with silver coins of 152 and 38 grains.

The Greek kings issued numerous copper coins, but their metrology is not clear. Gold coins must have been very rare. There exist a very large 20 stater piece of the Bactrian usurper Eucratides and rare staters of a few other kings.  Śaka and Pahlava coins in silver and copper follow the reduced IndoGreek standard.

## KUSANA COINS
These were minted in gold and copper. The gold dinras or suvarnas were based on the Roman denarius and were of 124 grains. Double and quarter dinras were also issued. The copper coins were large, of from 26 to 28 mdsas, or 240 to 260 grains.

## PRE-GUPTAN AND GUPTAN COINS
A large range of coins in silver and copper, of very varied weight andcharacter, was issued by the indigenous kings, tribes and cities of NorthernIndia in the centuries immediately preceding and following the beginning ofthe Christian era. The Satavahanas of the Deccan also issued coins of leadand potin (base silver), while the Sakas of Gujarat, Malwa and the WesternDeccan issued a distinctive series of coins in silver.

The gold coins of the Guptas (dfndra) originally approximated to theKusana standard, but in the middle of the 5th century rose in weight to 144grains, thus returning to the Indian standard of the copper kr.sapana. Guptasilver coins (ripaka), based on those of the Sakas of Ujjayini, weighed 32–36 grains. The metrology of Gupta copper coinage is obscure, and weightsof from 33s to 101 grains are attested.

## MEDIEVAL COINS
Gold coins (suvarna, tanka) were minted by only a few dynasties in the 11th century. These approximated to the Greek drachm standard of 67 grains. Silver coins (dramma, tanka) also conformed to this standard, andcoins of i, i and i dramma are attested. Numerous types of copper coin wereissued, of diverse metrology. The coinage of the medieval dynasties of thePeninsula was very varied and a full study of its metrology is yet to bemade.



APPENDIX X
THE ALPHABET AND ITS PRONUNCIATION
[Page 506]
The alphabet devised by ancient Indian phoneticians and adapted to all
the chief Indian languages except Urdfi is as follows:

I. VOWELS


II. CONSONANTS

[Page 507] To these letters the Dravidian languages and Sinhalese add
the short vowels e (between I and e) and 6 (between e and o). Sinhalese has
also the additional vowels a and d (between a and i). Tamil adds the
consonants 1, I (not the same as the vocalic I of Sanskrit), r, and n at the end
of the alphabet; these letters cannot stand at the beginning of a word. The
Tamil alphabet omits the aspirate letters and several others, and the
unvoiced letters serve to express the sound of the voiced. The system of
transliteration used for Tamil words and quotations in this book does not
show this peculiarity.

It will be seen that this alphabet is methodical and scientific, its elements
classified first into vowels and consonants, and then, within each section,
according to the manner in which the sound is formed. The gutturals are
formed by the constriction of the throat at the back of the tongue, the
palatals by pressing the tongue flat against the palate, the retroflex by
turning up the tip of the tongue to touch the hard palate, the dentals by
touching the upper teeth with the tongue, and the labials by pursing the lips.

The vowels a, i,,, i,, e, ai, o, and au are pronounced approximately as in
German or Italian, e and o being “close” sounds, as in German beten and
boten, but short a has the dull sound of the English shut. In very early times
r and the vocalic / were pronounced approximately as are the second
syllables of the words water and bottle by Americans, but before the
Christian era they were sounded as ri and Iri. The Sinhalese d and a are
pronounced approximately as the vowels in the English hat and hair
respectively. According to traditional phonetics e and o are classed as
diphthongs and in Sanskrit are invariably long.

Of the two first consonants h, occurring only at the end of words or
syllables, is a rough breathing, replacing an original s or r. It is a distinct
emission of breath, often followed by a faint continuation of the preceding
vowel. Anusvara, or m, written in Indian scripts as a dot, is in part a mere
abbreviation, representing a nasal sound before a stopped consonant. Thus
samdhi is pronounced as sandhi, and atmga as aniga. Before semi-vowels,
sibilants or h it had the effect of nasalizing the precedingvowel, as in
Frenchor Portuguese; thus amSu was pronounced very approximately as the
French un chou. By many moder speakers m in this position is pronounced
as the English ng in sang.

The distinction between the aspirate and unaspirate consonants is not
immediately recognized by the European, but it is clear to the Indian. K, for
instance, is pronounced without any noticeable emission of breath, and kh
(written as one letter in Indian scripts) with a strong emission, as in the
usual pronunciation of the English c in come. Thus the reader should avoid
the temptation to pronounce th and ph as the initial sounds of the English
thing and phial; they approximate to the sounds in pothook and shepherd. C
is pronounced approximately as the second consonantal sound in the
English church, and ch as the first sound in the same word, i.e., with a
stronger emission of breath. J is pronounced as in English, and not as in
German or French. A clear distinction is made between the retroflex or
cerebral [Page 508] consonants and the dental, though it is not very evident
to the untrained English ear. The English t and d are nearer to the Indian
retroflex t and d than to the Indian dentals t and d, which approximate to the
corresponding sounds in Italian.

Modern Indians do not generally differentiate in speaking between f and
s, and inscriptions show that the two sounds began to be confused at an
early date. Both resemble sh in the English shut. Originally s was
pronounced, like the other retroflex consonants, with the tip of the tongue
touching the top of the hard palate.

Of the special Tamil letters I has the sound of an I with the tongue turned
as far back as possible. Many modem Tamil speakers pronounce this letter
rather like the s in the English measure or the Frenchj, but more harshly.

The consonantal I (which also occurs in Vedic and some Prakrits) is
pronounced by placing the tongue on the top of the hard palate and flapping
it forward; r at the end of a syllable is often pronounced as t; between two
vowels it is approximately dr, and when doubled tr, while nr is usually
pronounced as ndr; though a distinction formerly existed Tamil n is in
modern speech indistinguishable from n.

We have seen that Vedic Sanskrit, like Greek, had a tonic accent, but this,
again as in Greek, disappeared very early from ordinary speech, its place
being taken by a stress accent, as in most European languages. The stress is
placed on the last prosodically long syllable of a word (i.e. a syllable
containing either a long vowel or a short vowel followed by two
consonants) other than the final syllable, which never has the accent. In a
word with no long syllables the accent is on the first syllable. E.g. sābhā,
Himalaya, Śakuntalā, ávayava. The stress is not as marked as in English.



APPENDIX XI
PROSODY
Like those of classical Europe the metres of Indian poetry are
quantitative, based on the order of long and short syllables, and not, as in
English, on stress. As in classical European languages a syllable was
counted as long if it contained a long vowel (ā, ī, ū, r, e, o, ai or au), or a
short vowel followed by two consonants. The favourite stanza form at all
times was of four lines or “quarters” (pāda), usually equal, and varying in
length from eight to over twenty syllables each, with a full caesura between
the the second and third quarters. Most of the metres of classical poetry
were set in rigid patterns and not divided into feet, but broken only by one
or two caesure in each quarter. The metres of the Veda, however, and the
epic sloka metre, allowed considerable variation.

Though most of the Vedic hymns are in stanzas of four quarters there are
some with three or five divisions. Of the former, one, called Gdyatr, is
common, and is that of the famous Gayatri verse quoted on p. 162. It [Page
509] consists of three sections of eight syllables each, the first four of which
are free, while the last four have the cadence
.

The commonest Vedic stanza is Tristubh, consisting of four quarters of
eleven syllables each. The quarter normally has a caesura after the fourth or
fifth syllable, and is prevailingly iambic. The last four syllables of each
quarter have the cadence. For example:
índrasya nu vtridni pra vocam
yini cakira prathamani vajrt.

Ahann Ahim, anu apds tatarda,
pra vaksdnd abhinat parvatdnmn. 12

Similar to this, but with an extra syllable in each quarter, was the
twelvesyllabled Jagatā, with the cadence


In the later hymns of the Rg Veda a stanza of four eight-syllable quarters,
called Anustubh, became popular. This was much the same as Gayatry, with
a fourth line added, but there was considerable variation in the final
cadence. For example:
Sahdsra-sirsd Purusah,
sahasrdksdh, sahdsrapdt.

Sd bhimim visvdto vrtva
dty atisthad dasāngulām.13

From the Anustubh of the Vedas developed the Śloka, the chief epic
metre of later times. This consisted of four quarters of eight syllables each,
the first and third normally ending with the cadence
, and the
second and fourth with
Certain
specified variations were
allowed. As an example we quote the first verse of the account of
Damayantī’s translated on p. 409.

Atha kale fubhe prdpte,
tithau pu.nye ksane tathd,
djuhava mahipaldn
Bhimo rdja svayamvare.


The Śloka metre was widely used for poetry of all kinds, especially for
didactic and narrative verse. The courtly poets, however, favoured longer
metres, with their quantities rigidly fixed in complicated rhythmic patterns,
some with regular cæsurae. Textbooks describe over 100 metres of this
kind, many with fanciful names, but only some twenty or thirty were
popular. Of these we mention a few of the most common.

Sragdharā (“The Girl with a Garland”) :
4 x 21:
The verses of Bāna quoted on p. 427 are in this metre.

In a few rather rare metres the first and third quarters differ in length
from the second and fourth. The commonest of these was Puspitāgrā :
2 x (12+13):

“Aham iha nivasāmi. ydhi Rādhdm,
anunaya madvacanena c’ ānayethāh”.

Iti Madhuripuzā sakhi niyuktā,
svayam idam etya punar jagāda Rādhām.21

As well as metres of this type there are others, the scansion of which is
based on the number of syllabic instants (mdtrd) in each quarter-verse. The
most common of these is Ārya (“The Lady”). This is divided into feet, each
containing four instants, counting a prosodically short sylable as one and a
long syllable as two instants (
.

The first quarter of the Ārya stanza contains three such feet; the second,
four and a half; the third, three, and the fourth three and a half, with an extra
short syllable after the second foot. The whole of Hala’s SaptaSataka is
written in this metre; for example:
Bhadtantīa tanāim
sotturm dinnāi jāi pahiassa.


Tāi ccea pahāe
ajjdā ādahāī ruanti. 22

[Page 512]
This verse is to be scanned as follows:

The metres employed by Jayadeva in his Gītā Govinda are exceptional,
although imitated by later poets. They are no doubt borrowed from popular
song. The stanzas of the lyric quoted on p. 429, excluding the refrain,
consist of four quarters of nine, eight, nine and ten syllables respectively, all
of which are short except the last rhyming syllable in the first and third
quarters and the penultimate in the second and fourth.

The prosody of Tamil poetry differs considerably from that of Sanskrit.

In Tamil the basic unit is the “metrical syllable” (aśai), which may be a
single syllable or a long syllable preceded by a short one. Two, three or four
of these form a foot, of which a line of poetry may contain from two to six
or occasionally more. Complicated rules, which cannot be discussed here,
much restrict the order of syllables and feet in the line.



APPENDIX XII
THE GYPSIES
Among India’s many gifts to the world we must include the Gypsies,
who, with their music and dancing, have formed a romantic and colourful
element in European life for over five centuries.

The European Gypsies have no recollection of their Indian origin, but
have generally claimed to be Egyptians. The Russian Gypsies, it is said,
even declare that their ancestors were a single soldier of the army of
Pharaoh and a young girl, who escaped drowning when Moses led the
Israelites over the Red Sea. This tradition of the Gypsies’ Egyptian origin
was for long taken at its face value, until, in 1763, a Hungarian protestant
theological student, Stefan Valyi, published a brief paper pointing to the
close similarity between the language of the Gypsies of his native plains
and that of three Indian theological students whom he had met at the
University of Leyden. It was long before the true significance of this fact
was recognized, but it is now universally agreed that the Gypsy language,
or Romani, is an Indo-āryan one, and that the fact can only be accounted for
by postulating that the Gypsies came from India.

The relationship of Romani to the languages of Northern India is very
obvious, even to those with no linguistic training, for many of the
commonest words of Romani are little different from those of India. Thus:

Philologists have shown by the comparison of Romani with the Prakrits
and modem Indian languages, that the Gypsies originated in the Ganges
basin, which they left before the time of Aśoka (3rd century B.C.), to reside
for several centuries in North-Western India. Probably even at this time they
were wandering musicians and entertainers. In modem India there is a
lowly caste of such people called Doms, attested since the early Middle
Ages, and with this word the word Rom, by which the Gypsies universally
designate themselves, is probably connected. In Syrian Romani it occurs as
Doum, very close to the Indian form.

According to the 11th c. Persian poet Firduisī, who collected many
legends and traditions of pre-Muslim Persia in his “Book of Kings” (Shāh-
nāmah), the 5th-century Sasanian king Bahram Gur, invited ten thousand
Indian musicians to his realm, and gave them cattle, corn and asses, that
they might settle in the land and entertain his poorer subjects, who had been
complaining that the pleasures of music and dance were reserved for the
rich. But the musicians refused to settle; they ate the cattle and seed-corn
which the king had given them, and wandered about the land like wolves or
wild dogs.

Though Firdusl’s story may not be wholly accurate, it shows that low
caste Indian musicians were well known in the Middle East at a very early
time. With the Arab conquest of Sind in the early 8th century further groups
of Indian entertainers must have found their way westwards and later have
moved on to Africa and Europe. Folk called Athinganoi are recorded as
living in Constantinople in A.D. 810, and later Byzantine records refer to
these Athinganoi or Azinganoi as magicians and conjurors.

[Page 514] These were probably the forerunners of the Tsigany bands
who appeared in Central and Western Europe in the late Middle Ages. The
earliest record of Gypsies in Europe other than in the Balkans is from the
German city of Hildesheim, where a passing band is recorded in 1407. A
great horde of Gypsies passed through Basel in 1422, under a chief who
called himself Michael, Prince of Egypt. Within a few decades they had
overrun all Europe; the earliest records show that they had all the
characteristics of their descendants-they were careless, lazy, dirty and
cheerful, skilled in metal work and tinkering, splendid musicians and
dancers, their bodies bedecked with bright garments and jewellery, their
menfolk cunning horsedealers, their womenfolk telling fortunes, and both
sexes losing no opportunity to pilfer from the unsuspecting gorjo. It was not
long before the Gypsies began to feel the fierce persecution which they
were to suffer in most parts of Europe down to the present day, when many
Gypsies perished in the gas-chambers of the Third Reich.

From the many loan-words in the various dialects of Romani we may
roughly trace the course of their migrations. All the Romani dialects of
West and Central Europe contain many Greek and South Slavonic words,
which prove that the ancestors of our western Gypsies dwelt long in the
Balkans. The Spanish Gypsies appear to have arrived in their new
homeland from two directions, a first immigration coming via Egypt and
the north coast of Africa, no doubt during the Moorish occupation of
southern Spain, and a second, later, over the Pyrenees.

Little but their language remains to connect the Gypsies with their
original home, and even their speech is full of borrowings from almost
every tongue of Europe and many of Asia. Though the Gypsies have always
tended to marry their own kind, centuries of wandering have left their mark
on the Gypsy type and there are now many fair Gypsies, though others, if
suitably attired, would not seem out of place in a modem North Indian city.

On analysis their music is that of the lands in which they dwell. Whether in
Hungary, Roumania or Spain, it is based on local folk-song and dance.

Unfortunately the English Gypsies have largely forgotten their traditional
art, but when they sing they sing folk-songs and music-hall ballads; in
Ireland the tinkers sing Irish folk-songs. Yet, wherever the Gypsies go, their
musicians tend to give their music a character of its own. A predilection for
ornamentation of the melody, especially with quarter-tones, a preference for
the minor mode, a tendency to introduce progressions by augmented whole
tones into their melodies, and a love of complex rhythm, are perhaps
survivals of the Indian musical tradition which the first Romanis brought
with them from their homeland. Some Gypsy folktales resemble those of
India, but the same may be said of the traditional tales of every country of
Europe. A few Gypsy customs and beliefs may be genuine Indian survivals.

Though by no means a hygienically inclined people, the Gypsies have ideas
of ritual purity and birth and death taboos which remind us of those of
Hinduism. Thus a woman in childbirth is impure, and must bear her child
outside her caravan or tent for fear of polluting it. Gypsy midwives are
impure throughout their lives, and are taboo to all respectable [Page 515]
Gypsies, like the outcast village midwives of India. Corpses are also
impure, and dying Gypsies are carried from their caravans to end their lives
in the open air, for fear of pollution. The Gypsy taboo on horse-slaughterers
may have an Indian origin. But all these resemblances might well be
accounted for otherwise.

The Gypsies have, in fact, forgotten their ancestry. In one respect,
however, they have kept to the traditions of their homeland. Though they
have adapted their ways to time and place, and have always been open to
new influences, they are still governed by their own laws and their own
code of morality. They have doggedly retained their individuality against
persecution and persuasion alike-an indepedent social group, transcending
regional and national boundaries, knit together by common customs,
common means of livelihood, and common blood. In this respect they are
Indian. They are a caste, as their Indian counterparts, the Doms, are a caste,
and even the innovations of the Twentieth Century have not been able to
destroy their caste solidarity.

1 The naksatras were: (1) Aśvinī (β and γ Arietis), (2) Bharani (85, 89,
and 41 Arietis), (8) Kr..ttika (Pleiades), (4) Rohi1)i (Aldebaran), (5)
Mrgaiiras (A, θ1, and θ2 Orionis), (6) Ardra (α_Orionis), (7) Punaroasu (α
and-β Geminorum), (8) Pusyā (α, δ, and θ Cancri), (9) Āsle1β (έ, η, 1α), p,
and a Hydree), (10) Magha (α, γ, έ, ζ, η, anμ Leonis), (11) Purva-phalguni
(δ and θ Leonis), (12) Uttara-phalguni (β and 98 Leonis), (13)Hasta (α, β, γ,
ε, and ε Corvi), (14) Citra(Spica, α Virginis), (15) Svati (Arcturus), (16)
YiJakha (α, β, γ, and I Librse), (17) Anuradha (β, δ, and π Scorpionis), (18)
Jyestha (α, σ, and t Scorpionis), (19) Mula (ε, ζ, η, θ, i, k, γ, and u
Scorpionis), (20) Purvaiatha (δ and ε Sagittarii), (21) Uttārā1āha γ and a
Sagittarii), (22) Srava1)a (α, β, and γ Aquilee), (23) Dhanistha or Sravātha
(α, β, γ, and δ Delphinis), (24) Satabhi1aj (y Aquarii etc.), (25) Purva-
bhadrapada (α and β Pegasi), (26) Uttarabhadrapadd γ Pegasi and a
Andromedee), and (27) Reuatt α Piscium, etc.), The 28th naksatra was
Abhijit (α, ε, and, δ Lyree), which was placed between Uttara1a{lha and
Srava1)a. It will be seen from this list that the ancient Indian system of
constellations differed widely from that of the West.

2The names of the planets had many synonyms, some of which were
evidently borrowed from the Greek, e.g. Ara, Ares, or Mars.

3At the “Churning of the Ocean” (p. 302) a demon named Rahu stole
some of the amrta. Visu destroyed his body, but as he had tasted of the
divine drink he had become immortal. His head and tail survive for ever in
the heavens, as Rahu and Ketu, and the head causes eclipses by trying to
swallow the planets. Of course the astronomers did not believe this myth,
and some texts explicitly reject it.

4The names of the months in early times were as follows: Madhu,
Madhava, Sukra, Śuci, Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isa, jrja, Sahas, Sahasya, Tapas,
Tapasya. The Vedic names are sometimes found in later poetry.

5 Epigraphia Indica, ii, 20.

6 Some earlier authorities, disinclined to give India her due, have
declared that none of these sources gives certain evidence of the existence
of a sign for zero. But Aryabha-tas’ text implies a knowledge of it, and
Severus Sebokht’s “nine symbols” would be quite useless for expressing
quantities over nine without a zero sign and place notation. The Maya of
Central America had a vigesimal numeral system with positional notation
long before this time, but it had, of course, no effect on the world at large
(S. G. Morley, The Ancient Maya, London, 1946, p. 274).

7 Caraka Santhitd, iii, 8, 7.

8 The Sanskrit terms for the seven aspects are: (1) syadasti, (2) sydnnasti,
(s) syddastindsti, (4) syddavaktavya, (5) syddastyavaktavya, (6)
sydnndstyavaktavya, and (7) syddastindstyavaktavya.

9 The Sanskrit names of the seven nayas are: (1) naigama, (2) saigraha,
(3) vyavahdra, (4) rjusutra, (5) fabda, (6) samabhiru.dha, and (7)
evambhuta.

10 We are much indebted to Dr. A. K. Narain, Reader in Indology at
Banāras Hindu University, for providing the material for this appendix.

system of transliteration has been modified in accordance with the usual
Indo-āryan system.
