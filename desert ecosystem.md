[[desert]]s are formed in regions with less than 25 cm of annual [[rainfall]], or sometimes in hot regions where there is more rainfall, but 
unevenly distributed in annual cycle.
climate of these biomes is modified by [[altitude]] & [[latitude]].
at high [[altitude]]s & at a greater [[distance]] from [[equator]] deserts are cold & hot near equator & tropics.
perennial plant like creosote bush, cactus are scattered throughout desert biomes.
in shallow depressed areas with salt deposits geese [[wood]], seep wood & salt grasses are common.
 b/c [[water]] is dominant limiting factor, [[productivity]] of a given desert is almost directly dependent on rainfall.
where [[soil]]s are suitable, [[irrigation]] can convert deserts into productive agricultural land.
