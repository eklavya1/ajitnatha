- Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems" (GIAHS) are outstanding landscapes of aesthetic beauty that combine agricultural biodiversity, resilient ecosystems, and valuable cultural heritage.
- Located in specific sites around the world, they sustainably provide multiple goods and services, food, and livelihood security for millions of small-scale farmers.
- Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) was started by the FAO to safeguard and support the world's agricultural heritage systems.
- Three recognized GIAHS sites in India:
	- Kuttanad Below Sea Level Farming System of Kerala.
	- Koraput Traditional Agriculture of Odisha.
	- Pampore Saffron Heritage of Kashmir.
- Across the world, 37 sites are designated as Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS), of which three are Indian — Kashmir (saffron), Koraput (traditional agriculture), and Kuttanad (below sea level farming).
- In India, over 811 cultivated plants and 902 of their wild relatives have been documented.
- Our other promising genetic resources include rice from Tamil Nadu (Konamani), Assam (Agni bora) and Kerala (Pokkali), Bhalia Wheat and mushroom (Guchhi) from Himachal Pradesh, and rich farm animal native breeds — cattle (42), buffaloes (1 5), goat (34), sheep (43) and chicken (19).
- Agrobiodiversity helps nutrition-sensitive farming and bio-fortified foods.
	- For instance, Moringa (drumstick) has micronutrients and sweet potato is rich in Vitamin A.
	- There are varieties of pearl millet and sorghum rich in [[iron]] and [[zinc]].

- The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO) leads the programme **Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems** (GIAHS), which helps identify ways to mitigate threats faced by these systems and their people and enhance the benefits derived from these dynamic systems.
- Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems recognize remarkable land use systems and landscapes full of life and [[biodiversity]], resilient ecosystems, and valuable cultural heritages managed by farmers, herders, fisherfolk, and forest people. Communities that have preserved and developed complex, diverse, and locally adapted agricultural systems that nowadays provide sustainably many goods and services, food, and livelihood security for millions of people around the world.The Programme has to date designated over 60 sites around the world.
