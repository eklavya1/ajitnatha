• Vulcanism
Vulcanism includes all the phenomenon associated 跟 movement of molten material from the interior 的 the earth to the surface.
它 involves 三 main processes -

○ Generation of magma
	§ Happens 里 the interior 的 earth due to the
		□ increase 里 热 ,
		□  decrease 里 pressure or
		□  increase 里 水 content (怎么 ？, 老师 说 不 问 :))))))
	§ These factors lowers the melting point 的 rocks

	§ Intr 的 magma into the lithospheric layers
○ Extrusion 的 magma
	§ Extr of molten material on to the surface

• Intrusive f特征s

• Batholiths
○ These are 长, irregular 和 有 dome-shaped features
○ Large body 的 magmatic materials that cools 里 deeper depths 的 crusts 和 develops large domes

Geography Class 14

A brief recap of the previous class

Volcanism

Vulcanism includes all the processes involved in the movement of molten material from the interior of the earth to the surface.
It involves 3 main Processes: Generation of Magma->Intrusion of Magma-> Extrusion of Magma
Generation of Magma- It is generated in the lower layers of the earth due to an increase in heat (radioactivity), decrease in pressure (lowering of the melting point), increase in water content (reduces the melting points of rocks). Any of the above conditions may lead to the melting of rocks

Magma vs Lava

Magma- Hot mobile molten silicate material (a combination of solid, liquid, and gases).
When Magma reaches the surface it erupts as Lava.
Lava is more volatile than Magma and it cools either on the surface or underwater. 

Magma
Lava
Below 	Above
Temperature ↓ 	Temperature ↑
Fluidity ↓ 	Fluidity ↑
Leads to the formation of Plutonic Rock 	Volcanic rocks

Types of Magma

Basaltic- Silica <52%, dark color, denser, more fluid, High temperature, extrusive rocks, Magnesium, Iron
Granitic- Silica >52%, light color, Lighter in density, less fluid, low temperature, intrusive rocks, Silica, Aluminium

Magma Generation and Plate tectonics

Divergent Plate boundary- O-O and C-C divergence (Basaltic magma. slow, continuous, quiet)
Convergent Plate boundary- O-C and O-C convergent (Andesitic magma, fast, intermittent, explosive, volcanic arc)
Volcanism along the Hotspots- Results in the eruption of Basaltic magma due to its origin in Mantle Plumes in intraplate regions. Eg: Reunion Hotspot, Hawai hotspot, etc.

Distribution of Volcanoes

Ridge Volcanism(Mid Atlantic Ridge, Karlsberg Ridge)
Volcanic Arcs (Japan, Kuril, Aleutian, etc)
Volcanic chains (along the fold mountains)
Volcanic clusters (along the rift valleys)
Volcanic lines (along with the hotspots)

Volcanic Features

Extrusive (above the surface)
Shield Volcano: the lava is very fluid and is capable of flowing for a very long distance; mountains formed are of large size and very slope; largest of all the other types; made up of basaltic magma.
Ash cinder cone: formed due to accumulation of loose particles around the vent; the continuous accumulation of ash increases the size.
Composite or Strato Volcano: formed due to the accumulation of various volcanic materials with lava acting as cementing agents.
Crater: depression at the mouth of volcanic vent.
Caldera: greatly enlarged depressions due to violent eruptions and subsidence of volcano.
Flood Basalt Province: when highly fluid lava flows for long-distance and covers thousands of kilometers of area. eg: Deccan Province.
Hot springs: when water sinks deep enough beneath the surface to be heated by a hot spot or magma chamber, it rises to the surface w/o any explosion. Eg: Tatapani (Shimla)
Geysers: It's a fountain of hot water + superheated steam ejected intermittently at regular intervals. Eg: Iceland.
Fumaroles: These are continuous jet-like emissions of steam and other gases. 
Intrusive (below the surface)- Batholith, lopolith, Laccolith, Phacolith, Sill, Dyke
Batholith- These are large irregular dome-shaped features and a large body of magmatic material that cools in the deeper depths of crust.
Laccolith- It is a large blister of the igneous mound with a dome-shaped or mushroom-shaped upper surface and a level base fed by a pip-like conduit from below.
Lopolith- If the magma solidifies in a saucer-shaped shallow basin it forms lopolith.
Phacolith- It is formed by the intrusion of magma along the anticlines and synclines of folded layers below the surface.
Sills- These are the horizontal layers of magma accumulation along the bedding planes.
Dykes- These are the vertical wall-like formations due to the accumulation of magma.
