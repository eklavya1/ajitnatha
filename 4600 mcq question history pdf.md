The many conflicting voices that had to be negotiated by the Constituent  Assembly in forming the constituent and many Somnath Lahiri, a Communist member, cautioned, “Beware of the British Imperialism that had a hand in its birth and still looms over its deliberations”.  BR Ambedkar no longer argued for separate electorates for the ‘Untouchables’ or depressed castes; but B Pocker Bahadur from Madras made a powerful plea for continuing these.  RV Dhulekar warned that it was a cover used by the British to divide the people. Better to give it up now.  Sardar Patel said that separate electorates was a poison that has entered the body politic of our country. These should be done away.  Govind Vallabh Pant declared that it was not only harmful for the nation but also for the minorities. It would isolate the minorities permanently and deprive them of any effective say within the government. It would lead to divided loyalties.  Begam Aizaz Rasul felt that separate electorates were self destructive since they isolate the minorities from the majority.  kNG Ranga, a leader of the peasant movement, urged that the term ministries be interpreted in economic terms. The real minorities were the poor and the downtrodden. He pointed out that to effectively enjoy the constitutionally enshrined rights ‘they needed props’.  Jaipal Singh was a representative of the tribals. He made a plea for breaking the emotional and physical distance that separated the tribals from the society.  J Nagappa from Madras said that the systematic marginalisation of the depressed castes should end.  Jawaharlal Nehru argued for a strong centre; while K Santhanam from Madras defended the rights of the State.  Gopalaswami Ayyangar declared, as did BR Ambedkar that ‘the centre should be made strong’.  Balakrishna Sharma from the United Provinces reasoned at length that only a strong centre could plan for the well-being of the country.  With regards to the language of the nation by the 1930s the congress had accepted that it ought to be Hindustani, a blend of Hindi and Urdu, commonly spoken and understood by people at the suggestion of Mahatma Gandhi. But as communal conflicts deepened, Hindi and Urdu also started growing apart. On the one hand, there was a move to sanskritize Hindi, purging it of all words of Persian and Arabic origin. On the other hand, Urdu  was being increasingly Persianised. RV Dhulekar, from the United Provinces made a strong plea to use Hindi as the language of Constitution making.  G Durgabai from Madras felt that ‘this propaganda for Hindi cuts at the very root of the Provincial languages’. To begin with she had obeyed the call of Mahatma Gandhi and carried on the propaganda in the south and braved resistance. She had accepted Hindustani, but now that its inclusive composite character had been eroded, it created fears amongst different language groups. This view was seconded by Shri Shankarrao Deo from Bombay. The Language Committee resolved the deadlock by referring to Hindi as the It became the focus of his attention for life.
