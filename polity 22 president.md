- æ™‚ - `06:43 am 28/8/2021`

# manner of election of pres
- æ™‚ - `06:47 am 28/8/2021`
- ![[a35 legislation to give effect to provisions of this part]]
- ![[a55 Manner of election of President]]
- election for poi takes place by prop repre via a _single transferable vote_ (stv)
- term prop repre is a misnomer as there is only 1 seat to pres of india.
- perhaps , obje behin inc term prp repre was to make it clear that fptp would not be followed. as a res, a successful in supposed to get 50% of poled votes @ elec
- this sys aka `alternative voting system`
- meaning of stv
	- under this sys elector needs to indicate more than 1 preference for candidate & can indicate as many preferences as there are candidates in contest.
	- in 1st round of counting, only 1st pref votes are consider & if a candidate more than 50% of votes, he wins election. but if no 1 secures this, then candidate with least no. of pref votes is eliminated & 2nd pref votes of that candidate are transferred to other candidates in need.
	- process continues until a candidate gets  majority of total votes
# summary	
revision of last class
president of india.
# president of india (continued)
president's office can never be vacant.
president of india can be said as a rubber stamp on foll basis:

- article 74(1) #pres _[[a74 council of ministers to aid & advise president]]_ of indian constitution says that president is bound by aid & advice of council of ministers.
- acc to article 75(3) _[[a75 Other provisions as to Ministers]]_ of indian constitution, `it's coms & not president who is responsible to people through their representative in parliament.`

# election of president
president of india is elected indirectly.
## reasons for choosing indirect election of president:
- direct election would have been a wasteful expenditure to elect a person for a nominal post through a time-consuming & cost-intensive process.
- direct election would have ended up creating 2 power centers resulting in a tussle b/w prime minister & president. ^1498c2
- to make post of president of india apolitical in nature & free from whims & fancies of political parties.
# electoral college
election of president is done by [[electoral college]].electoral college consists of-
- `elected members of parliament`.
- `elected member of state legislative assemblies` due to foll reasons:
	- president is not head of center alone but head of indian states.
	- considering india a [[federation]], president of india should represent entire federation including states
	- therefore `mlas` are included to give a representation to states.
	- electoral college also includes `element members of puducherry & delhi legislative assembly.`

- members ==not part== of electoral college are:
- nominated member of parliament.
- member of legislative council as not all states have legislative councils therefore including mlcs would have given them unfair advantage over other states. 
- article 55 _[[a55 Manner of election of President]]_ : manner of election of president:
- article 55(1): provides for uniformity in scale of representation of diff states at election of president. 
- article 55(2)(a): ==value of vote of mla= (total population of states/ total number of mlas in state)/1000.==
- population is measured based on census of 1971 because after 1971 several northern states experienced a population explosion that would have given them undue advantage over southern states that controlled their population.
- article 55(2)(c): ==value of vote of mp=(total value of all mlas of country/total number of mps).==

# election methods
## fptp 
- fast past post system: [[first past post system]]
- there is a single seat & person with maximum votes wins seat.

## proportional representation: 
- there will be multiple seats.
- seats won are in proportion to vote received.

- article 55(3) _[[a55 Manner of election of President]]_ : election of president shall be held in accordance with system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote 
- term [[proportional representation]] is a misnomer as there is only 1 seat to president of india.
- perhaps objective behind term proportional representation was to make it clear that fptp system would not be followed.
- as a result, a successful candidate is supposed to get  50 % of polled votes in election.
- therefore right term would be `alternative voting system `
## single transferable vote
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxystnd0dck
- meaning of single transferable vote:
	- under this system, elector needs to indicate more than 1 preference of candidate.
	- & can indicate as many preferences as there are candidates in contest.
	- in 1st round of counting, only 1st preference votes are considered.
	- if a candidate obtains more than 50 % of votes she wins election.
	- but if no 1 secures more than 50 % vote, then candidate with least number of 1st preference vote is eliminated & 2nd preference vote of that candidate is transferred to other candidates in need.
	- process continues until a candidate gets a majority of total votes.
