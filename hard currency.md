It is the intemational currency in which the highest faith is shown and is needed by every economy.
The strongest currency in the world is one that has a high level of liquidity.
The economy with the highest as well as highly diversified exports that are compulsive imports for other countries (as of high-level technology, defense products, life-saving medicines,
and petroleum products) will also create high demand for its currency in the world and become the hard currency.
It is always scarce.
Some of the best hard currencies of the world today are the US Dollar, the Euro(€), the Japanese Yen(%), and the UK Sterling Pound (E).
Meanwhile, by late 2015, the IMF allowed the SDR to be denominated in the Chinese 'Yaan'—paving the way for a new hard currency to be implemented in 2016.
