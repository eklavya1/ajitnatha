It is an enrichment of water by nutrient salts that cause structural changes to the ecosystem such as increased production of algae and aquatic plants, depletion of fish species, general deterioration of water quality and other effects that reduce and preclude use.
Eutrophication comes from the Greek word eutrophos which means well-nourished.
In this process, excessive growth of plants and algae take place because of over-supply of nutrients.
This process also leads to oxygen depletion in the water body.
It is almost always catalysed by the disposal of nitrate or phosphate-containing detergents, fertilizers, or sewage into an aquatic system.
It promotes the overgrowth of plants and algae. After such organisms die, the bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of hypoxia (state of having less oxygen).
It can also occur outside water bodies. For example, soils can be eutrophic when they have high levels of nitrogen, phosphorous or other nutrients.
It is a critical environmental problem as it leads to a decline in water quality.
