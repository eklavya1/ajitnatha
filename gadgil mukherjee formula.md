up to 3rd five year plan (fyp) [1961-66] & during plan holiday (1966-69), allocation of central plan assistance to states was schematic & no formula was in use.
gadgil formula was adopted during 4th fyp (1969-74) & used in 5th fyp (1974-78).
**it comprised of -**
	population [60%]
	per capita income (pci) [10%]
	tax effort [10%]
	ongoing irrigation & power projects [10%] &
	special problems [10%]
however, ongoing irrigation & power projects was perceived as being weighted in favor of rich states, formula was modified by raising weightage of pcl to 20%.
national development council (ndc) approved modified gadgil formula in august 1980.
it formed basis of allocation during 6th fyp (1980-85), 7th fyp (1985-90), & annual plan (ap) 1990-91. hence statement 2 is correct.
following suggestions from state governments, modified gadgil formula was revised to

1. population (55%),
2. pci [25% {20% by deviation method & 5% by distance method}]
3. fiscal management (5%) &
4. special development problems (15%).
however, it was used only during annual plan 1991-92. due to reservations of state governments on revision, a committee under shri pranab mukherjee, then deputy chairman, planning commission was constituted to evolve a suitable formula.
suggestions made by committee were considered by ndc in december 1991 , where following a consensus, gadgii-mukherjee formula was adopted.
it was made basis for allocation during 8th fyp (1992-97) & it has since been in use in five-year plans.

## confusion points
### gadgil plan or 3rd five year plan
it is different from gadgil formula mentioned above.
gadgil yojana was formulated with formulation of third five-year plan.
national development council (ndc) provides final approval to third five-year plan in india.
in gadgil yojana to exp& primary industries, those are chemical industries, steel, power, & fuel, etc.
developing agriculture system & making use of workforce resources ultimately & to guarantee a substantial expansion in service opportunities.
implementation of third five-year plan was run into many difficulties like problem in this plan was sino-indian conflict & then, indo-pakistan hostilities in concluding stage of program.
