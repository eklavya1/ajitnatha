- MOST of the art and architectural remains that survive from Ancient and Medieval India are religious in nature. That does not mean that people did not have art in their homes at those times, but domestic dwellings and the things in them were mostly made from materials like wood and clay which have perished. This chapter introduces us to many types of temples from India. Although we have focussed mostly on Hindu temples, at the end of the chapter you will find some information on major Buddhist and Jain temples too. However, at all times, we must keep in mind that religious shrines were also made for many local cults in villages and forest areas, but again, not being of stone the ancient or medieval shrines in those areas have also vanished. Early Temples While construction of stupas continued, Brahmanical temples and images of gods also started getting constructed. Often temples were decorated with the images of gods. Myths mentioned in the Puranas became part of narrative representation of the Brahmanical religion. Each temple had a principal image of a god. The shrines of the temples were of three kinds— #low_confidence 
- (i) sandhara type (without pradikshinapatha),
- (ii) nirandhara type (with pradakshinapatha), and
- (iii) sarva to bhadra (which can be accessed from all sides).

- Some of the important temple sites of this period are Deogarh in Uttar Pradesh, Eran, Nachna-Kuthara and Udaygiri near Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh. These temples are simple structures consisting of a veranda, a hall and a shrine at the rear.

_to day when we say 'temple' in English we generally mean a devalaya, devkula mandir, kovil, deol, devasthanam or prasada depending on which part of India we are in._

## THE BASIC FORM OF THE HINDU TEMPLE
- The basic form of the Hindu temple comprises the following:
- (i) sanctum (_garbhagriha_ literally ‘womb-house’),which was a small cubicle with a single entrance andgrew in to a larger chamber in time. The garbhagriha is made to house the main icon which is itself the focus of much ritual attention;
- (ii) the _entrance_ to the temple which may be a portico or colonnaded hall that in corporates space for a large number of worshippers and is known as a [[mandapa]];
- (iii) freestanding temples tend to have a mountain-like spire, which can take the shape of a curving shikhar in North India and a pyramidal  tower, called a [[vimana]], in South India;
- (iv) the _vahan_,i.e., the mount or vehicle of the temple’s main deity alongwith a standard pillar or dhvaj is placed axially before the sanctum. Two broad orders of temples in the country are known— Nagara in the north and Dravida in thesouth. At times, the Vesar style of temples as an independent style created through the selective mixing of the Nagara and Dravida orders is mentioned by some scholars. Elaborate studies are available on the various sub-styles within these orders. We will look in to the differences in the forms further on in this chapter. as temples grew more complex, more surfaces were created for sculpture through additive geometry, i.e., by adding more and more rhythmically projecting, symmetrical walls and niches, without breaking away from the fundamental plan of the shrine.

![[Pasted image 20211206205503.png]]
## SCULPTURE, ICONOGRAPHY AND ORNAMENTATION
- _The study of images of deities falls within a branch of art his to ry called ‘iconography’_ , which consists of identification of images based on certain symbols and mythologies associated with them. And very often, while the fundamental myth and meaning of the deity may remain the same for centuries, its specific usage at a spot can bea response to its local or immediate social, political orgeographical context. Every region and period produced its own distinct style of images with its regional variations in iconography. The temple is covered with elaborate sculpture and ornamentthat form a fundamental part of its conception. The placement of an image in a temple is carefully planned: for instance, river goddesses (Ganga and Yamuna) are usually found at the entrance of a garbhagriha in a Nagara temple, dvarapalas (doorkeepers) are usually found on the gateways or [[gopurams]] of Dravida temples, similarly, [[mithunas]] (erotic images), [[navagrahas]] (the nine auspicious planets) and [[yaksha]]s are also placed at entrances to guard them. Various forms or aspects of the main divinity are to be found on the outer walls of the sanctum. The deities of directions, i.e., the [[ashtadikpala]]s face the eight key directions on the outer walls of the sanctum and/or on the outer walls of a temple. Subsidiary shrines around the main temple are dedicated to the family or incarnations of the main deity. Finally, various elements of ornamentation such as gavaksha, vyala/yali, kalpa-lata, amalaka, kalasha,etc. are used in distinct ways and places in a temple.
## THE NAGARA OR NORTH INDIAN TEMPLE STYLE
- The style of temple architecture that became popular in northern India is known as nagara [[nagara style]]. In North India it is common for an entire temple to be built on a stone platform with steps leading up to it. Further, unlike in [[South India]] it does not usually have elaborate boundary walls or gateways. While the earliest temples had just one tower, or shikhara, later temples had several . The garbhagriha is always located directly under the tallest  tower. There are many subdivisions of nagara temples depending on the shape of the shikhara. There are different names for the various parts of the temple in different parts
![[Pasted image 20211206210032.png]]

- The third main sub- type of the nagara building is what is generally called the [[valabhi type]] . These are rectangular buildings type with a roof that rises in to a vaulted chamber. The edge of this vaulted chamber is rounded, like the bamboo or wooden wagons that would have been drawn bybullocks in ancient times. They are usually called ‘wagon vaulted type buildings ’. As mentioned above, the form of the temple is influenced by ancient building forms that werealready in existence before the fifth century CE. The valabhi type of building was one of them. For instance, if you study the ground-plan of many of the Buddhist rock-cut chaitya caves, you will notice that they are shaped as long halls which end in a curved back. From the inside, the roof of this portion also looks like a wagon-vaulted roof.

## Central India
- Ancient temples of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan share many traits. The most visible is that they are made of sandstone. Some of the oldest surviving structural temples from the Gupta Period are in MadhyaPradesh. These are relatively modest-looking shrines eachhaving four pillars that support a small mandapa which looks like a simple square porch-like extension before an equally small room that served as the garbhagriha. Importantly, of the two such temples that survive, one is at Udaigiri, which is on the outskirts of Vidisha and is part of a larger Hindu complex of cave shrines, while theother one is at Sanchi, near the stupa. This is the first temple having a flat roof. This means that similar developments were being incorporated in the architecture of temples of type both type the religions.Deogarh (in Lalitpur District, Uttar Pradesh) was built in the early sixth century CE. That is, about a hundred years or so after the small temples we just learnt about in Sanchi and Udaigiri. This makes it a classic example of a late Gupta Period type of temple. This temple is in the panchayatana style of architecture where the main shrineis built on a rectangular plinth with four smaller subsidiary shrines at the four corners (making it a total number of five shrines, hence the name, panchayatana). The tall and curvilinear shikhara also corroborates this date. The presence of this curving latina or rekha-prasada type type of shikhara also makes it clear that this is an early example of a classic nagara style of temple

- _Sheshashayana is the form of Vishnu where he is shown reclining on the sheshanaga called Ananta.Nara-Narayan shows the discussion between the human soul and the eternal divine. Gajendramoksha is the s to ry of achieving moksha, symbolically communicated by Vishnu’s suppression of an asura who had taken the form of an elephant._

![[Pasted image 20211206210119.png]]


- This west-facing temple has a grand doorway with standing sculptures of female figures representing the Ganga on the left side and the Yamuna on the right side. The temple depicts Vishnu in various forms, due to which it was assumed that the four subsidiary shrines must also have housed Vishnu’s avatars and the temple was mistaken for adasavatara temple. In fact, it is not actually known to whom the four subsidiary shrines were originally dedicated. There are three main reliefs of Vishnu on the temple walls: Sheshashayana on the south, Nara-Narayan on the east and Gajendramoksha on the west. The temple is west-facing,which is less common, as mosttemples are east- or north-facing.Numerous temples of smaller dimensions have beenconstructed over a period of time.By contrast, if we study the temples of Khajuraho made by the Chandela Kings in the tenthcentury, i.e., about four hundred years after the temple at Deogarh, we can see how dramatically the shape and style of the nagara temple architecture had developed.

- The Lakshmana temple of Khajuraho, dedicated to Vishnu, was built in 954 by the Chandela king, Dhanga. Anagara temple, it is placed on a high platform accessed bystairs. There are four smaller temples in the corners, and all the  towers or shikharas rise high, upward in a curved pyramidal fashion, emphasising the temple’s vertical thrustending in a horizontal fluted disc called an amalak to pped with a kalash or vase. The crowning elements: amalak and kalash, are to be found on all nagara temples of this period. The temple also has projecting balconies and verandahs,thus very different from Deogarh.

- Kandariya Mahadeo temple at Khajuraho is the epitome of temple architecture in Central India. In the architecture and the sculptures of this temple, which is a massive structure, we see all features of central Indian temples of the medival period for which they are known and appreciated all over. Khajuraho’s temples are also known for their extensive erotic sculptures; the erotic expressionis given equal importance in human experience as spiritualpursuit, and it is seen as part of a larger cosmic whole.Many Hindu temples, therefore, feature mithun (embracingcouple) sculptures, considered auspicious. Usually, they are placed at the entrance of the temple or on an exterior

![[Pasted image 20211206210442.png]]


![[Pasted image 20211206210457.png]]


![[Pasted image 20211206210516.png]]


- wall or they may also be placed on the walls between the mandapa and the main shrine. Khajuraho’s sculptures are highly stylised with typical features: they are in almost full relief, cut away from the surrounding stone, with sharpnoses, prominent chins, long slanting eyes and eyebrows. There are many temples at Khajuraho, most of themdevoted to Hindu gods. There are some Jain temples as wellas a Chausanth Yogini temple, which is of interest. Predatingthe tenth century, this is a temple of small, square shrines ofroughly-hewn granite blocks, each dedicated to devis orgoddesses associated with the rise of Tantric worship afterthe seventh century. several such temples were dedicated to the cult of the yoginis across Madhya Pradesh, Odisha andeven as far south as Tamil Nadu. They were built between the seventh and tenth centuries, but few have survived.
## West India
- The temples in the north-western parts of India including Gujarat and Rajasthan, and stylistically extendable, at times, to western Madhya Pradesh are too numerous to include

![[Pasted image 20211206210553.png]]

![[Pasted image 20211206210614.png]]

- here in any comprehensive way. The stone used to build the temples ranges in colour and type . While sandstone is the commonest, a grey to black basalt can be seen in some of the tenth to twelveth century temple sculptures. The most exuberant and famed is the manipulatable soft white marble which is also seen in some of the tenth to twelveth century Jain temples in Mount Abu and the fifteenth century temple at Ranakpur.
- Among the most important art-his to rical sites in the region is Samlaji in Gujarat which shows how earlier artistic traditions of the region mixed with a post-Gupta style and gave rise to a distinct style of sculpture. A large number of sculptures made of grey schist have been found in this region which can be dated between the sixth and eighth centuries CE. While the patronage of these is debated, the date is established on the basis of the style.

- The Sun temple at Modhera dates back to early eleventh century and was built by Raja Bhimdev I of the [[Solanki Dynasty]] in [[1026]]. There is a massive rectangular stepped tank called the surya kund in front of it. Proximity of sacred architecture to a water body such as a tank, a river or a pond has been noticed right from the earliest times. By theearly eleventh century they had become a part of many temples. This hundred-square-metre rectangular pond is perhaps the grandest temple tank in India. A hundred and eight miniature shrines are carved in between the steps inside the tank. A huge ornamental arch- to rana leads one to the sabha mandapa (the assembly hall) which is open on all sides, as was the fashion of the times in western and central Indian temples.
- The influence of the woodcarving tradition of Gujarat is evident in the lavish carving and sculpture work. However, the walls of the central small shrine are devoid of carving and are left plain as the temple faces the east and, every year, at the time of the equinoxes, the sun shines directly in to this central shrine.
## East India
- Eastern Indian temples include those found in the North East, Bengal and Odisha. Each of these three areas produced distinct types of temples. The his to ry of architecture in the North-East and Bengal is hard to study because a number of ancient type buildings type in those regions

![[Pasted image 20211206210731.png]]


- were renovated, and what survives now are later brick or concrete temples at those sites. It appears that terracotta was the main medium of construction, and also for moulding plaques which depicted Buddhist and Hindu deities in Bengal until the seventh century. A large number of sculptures have been found in Assam and Bengal which shows the development of important regional schools in those regions.

- Assam: An old sixth-century sculpted door frame from DaParvatia near Tezpur and another few stray sculptures from [[Rangagora]] Tea Estate near [[Tinsukia]] in Assam bear witness to the import of the Gupta idiom in that region. This post-Gupta style continued in the region well in to the tenth century. However, by the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, a distinct regional style developed in Assam. The style that came with the migration of the Tais from Upper Burma mixed with the dominant Pala style of Bengaland led to the creation of what was late r known as theAhom style in and around Guwahati. Kamakhya temple, aShakti Peeth, is dedicated to Goddess Kamakhya and wasbuilt in the seventeenth century.

- Bengal: The style of the sculptures during the period between the ninth and eleventh centuries in Bengal (including Bangladesh) and Bihar is known as the Pala style, named after the ruling dynasty at the time, while the style of those of the mid-eleventh to mid-thirteenthcenturies is named after the Sena kings. While the Palasare celebrated as patrons of many Buddhist monastic sites,the temples from that region are known to express thelocal Vanga style. The ninth century Siddheshvara

![[Pasted image 20211206210842.png]]

- Mahadeva temple in Barakar in Burdwan District, for example, shows a tall curving shikhara crowned by a large amalaka and is an example of the early Pala style. It issimilar to contemporaneous temples of Odisha. This basicform grows loftier with the passing of centuries. Many of the temples from the ninth to the twelfth century werelocated at Telkupi in Purulia District. They were submergedwhen dams were built in the region. These were amongstthe important examples of architectural styles prevalentin the region which showed an awareness of all the known nagara sub- types that were prevalent in the rest of NorthIndia. However, several temples still survive in PuruliaDistrict which can be dated to this period. The black to grey basalt and chlorite stone pillars and arched nichesof these temples heavily influenced the earliest Bengalsultanate type buildings type at Gaur and Pandua. Many localvernacular building traditions of Bengal also influencedthe style of temples in that region. Most prominent of thesewas the shape of the curving or sloping side of the bambooroof of a Bengali hut. This feature was eventually even adopted in Mughal type buildings , and is known across NorthIndia as the Bangla roof. In the Mughal period and late r,scores of terracotta brick temples were built across Bengaland Bangladesh in a unique style that had elements oflocal building techniques seen in bamboo huts which werecombined with older forms reminiscent of the Pala periodand with the forms of arches and domes that were takenfrom Islamic architecture. These can be widely found in andaround Vishnupur, Bankura, Burdwan and Birbhum andare dated mostly to the seventeenth century.

![[Pasted image 20211206210924.png]]

Odisha: The main architectural features of Odisha temples are classified in three orders, i.e., rekhapida, pidhadeul and khakra. Most of the main temple sites are located in ancientKalinga—modern Puri District, including Bhubaneswar orancient Tribhuvanesvara, Puri and Konark. The temples ofOdisha constitute a distinct sub-style within the nagara order. In general, here the shikhara, called deul in Odisha, is vertical almost until the to p when it suddenly curvessharply inwards. Deuls are preceded, as usual, by mandapascalled jagamohana in Odisha. The ground plan of the maintemple is almost always square, which, in the upper reachesof its superstructure becomes circular in the crowning mastaka. This makes the spire nearly cylindrical inappearance in its length. Compartments and niches aregenerally square, the exterior of the temples are lavishlycarved, their interiors generally quite bare. Odisha templesusually have boundary walls.
- At Konark, on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, lie the majestic ruins of the Surya or Sun temple built in stone around 1240. Its shikhara was a colossal creation said to have reached 70m, which, proving too heavy for its site, fell in the nineteenth century. The vast complex is withina quadrilate ral precinct of which the jagamohana or thedance-pavillion (mandapa) has survived, which though nolonger accessible is said to be the largest enclosed spacein Hindu architecture.
The Sun temple is set on a high base, its walls covered in extensive, detailed ornamental carving. These include twelve pairs of enormous wheels sculpted with spokes and

![[Pasted image 20211206211003.png]]

- hubs, representing the chariot wheels of the Sun god who, in mythology, rides a chariot driven by seven horses,sculpted here at the entrance staircase. The whole templethus comes to resemble a colossal processional chariot. Onthe southern wall is a massive sculpture of surya carvedout of green stone. It is said that there were three such images, each carved out of a different stone placed on thethree temple walls, each facing different directions. Thefourth wall had the doorway in to the temple from wherethe actual rays of the sun would enter the garbhagriha.
## The Hills
- A unique form of architecture developed in the hills of Kumaon, Garhwal, Himachal and Kashmir. Kashmir’s proximity to prominent Gandhara sites ( such as Taxila, Peshawar and the northwest frontier) lent the region a strong Gandhara influence by the fifth century CE. This began to mix with the Gupta and post-Gupta traditions that were brought to it from Sarnath, Mathura and even centres in Gujarat and Bengal. Brahmin pundits and Buddhist monks frequently travelled between Kashmir,Garhwal, Kumaon and religious centres in the plains like Banaras, Nalanda and even as far south as Kanchipuram.As a result type both type Buddhist and Hindu traditions began to intermingle and spread in the hills. The hills also had their own tradition of wooden type buildings type with pitched roofs. At several places in the hills, therefore, you will find that while the main garbhagriha and shikhara are made in a rekha-prasada or latina style, the mandapa is of an older form of wooden architecture. Sometimes, the temple itself takes on a pagoda shape.

![[Pasted image 20211206211043.png]]


The Karkota period of Kashmir is the most significant in terms of architecture. One of the most important templesis Pandrethan, built during the eighth and ninth centuries.In keeping with the tradition of a water tank attached to the shrine, this temple is built on a plinth built in the middle of a tank. Although there are evidences of type both Hindu and Buddhist followings in Kashmir, this temple isa Hindu one, possibly dedicated to Shiva. The architecture of this temple is in keeping with the age-old kashmiri tradition of wooden type buildings . Due to the snowy conditions in Kashmir, the roof is peaked and slants slowly outward. The temple is moderately ornamented, moving away fromthe post-Gupta aesthetics of heavy carving. A row ofelephants at the base and a decorated doorway are theonly embellishments on the shrine.
like the findings at Samlaji, the sculptures at Chamba also show an amalgamation of local traditions with a post Gupta style. The images of Mahishasuramardini and Narasimha at the Laksna-Devi Mandir are evidences of the influence of the post-Gupta tradition. type both type the images show the influence of the metal sculpture tradition of Kashmir. The yellow colour of the images is possibly due to an alloy of zinc and copper which were popularly used to make images in Kashmir. This temple bears an inscription that states that it was built during the reign of Meruvarman who lived in the seventh century.
Of the temples in Kumaon, the ones at Jageshwar near Almora, and Champavat near Pithoragarh, are classic examples of nagara architecture in the region.

![[Pasted image 20211206211201.png]]


## THE DRAVIDA OR SOUTH INDIAN TEMPLE STYLE
- Unlike the nagara temple, the dravida temple is enclosed within a compound wall. The front wall has an entrance gateway in its centre, which is known as a gopuram. The shape of the main temple  tower known as vimana in Tamil Nadu is like a stepped pyramid that rises up geometrically rather than the curving shikhara of North India. In the South Indian temple, the word ‘shikhara’ is used only for the crowning element at the to p of the temple which is usually shaped like a small stupika or an octagonal cupola— this is equivalent to the amlak and kalasha of North Indian temples. Whereas at the entrance to the North Indian temple’s garbhagriha, it would be usual to find images such as mithunas and the river goddesses, Ganga and Yamuna,in the south you will generally find sculptures of fiercedvarapalas or the door-keepers guarding the temple. It iscommon to find a large water reservoir, or a temple tank,enclosed within the complex. Subsidiary shrines are either incorporated within the main temple  tower, or located asdistinct, separate small shrines beside the main temple. The North Indian idea of multiple shikharas rising to getheras a cluster was not popular in South India. At some of the most sacred temples in South India, the main templein which the garbhagriha is situated has, in fact, one of the smallest  towers. This is because it is usually the oldestpart of the temple. With the passage of time, the populationand size of the to wn associated with that temple wouldhave increased, and it would have become necessary to make a new boundary wall around the temple. This would have been taller that the last one, and its gopurams would have been even loftier. So, for instance, the Srirangam temple in Tiruchirapally has as many as seven ‘concentric’ rectangular enclosure walls, each with gopurams. The outermost is the newest, while the  tower right in the centre housing the garbhagriha is the oldest.
- Temples thus started becoming the focus of urban architecture. Kanchipuram, Thanjavur or Tanjore, Madurai and Kumbakonam are the most famous temple to wns of Tamil Nadu, where, during the eighth to twelfth centuries, the role of the temple was not limited to religious matters alone. Temples became rich administrative centres, controlling vast areas of land.
- Just as there are many subdivisions of the main types of nagara temples, there are subdivisions also of dravida temples. These are basically of five different shapes: square, usually called kuta, and also caturasra; rectangular or shala or ayatasra; elliptical, called gaja-prishta or elephant backed, or also called vrittayata, deriving from wagon vaulted shapes of apsidal chaityas with a horse-shoe shapedentrance facade usually called a nasi; circular or vritta;and octagonal or ashtasra. Generally speaking, the plan of the temple and the shape of the vimana were conditionedby the iconographic nature of the consecrated deity, so it was appropriate to build specific types of temples for specific types of icons. It must, however, be remembered that thisis a simplistic differentiation of the subdivisions. several different shapes may be combined in specific periods andplaces to create their own unique style.![[Pasted image 20211206211557.png]]


![[Pasted image 20211206211612.png]]

- The Pallavas were one of the ancient South Indian dynasties that were active in the Andhra region from the second century CE onwards and moved south to settle in Tamil Nadu. Their his to ry is better documented from thesixth to the eighth century, when they left manyinscriptions in stone and several monuments. Theirpowerful kings spread their empire to various parts of thesubcontinent, at times reaching the borders of Odisha, and their links with South–East Asia were also strong.Although they were mostly Shaivite, several Vaishnavashrines also survived from their reign, and there is nodoubt that they were influenced by the long Buddhisthis to ry of the Deccan.

- Their early type buildings , it is generally assumed, were rock cut, while the late r ones were structural. However, there is reason to believe that structural type buildings type were well known even when rock-cut ones were being excavated. The early type buildings type are generally attributed to the reign of Mahendravarman I, a contemporary of the Chalukyan king, Pulakesin II of Karnataka. Narasimhavarman I, also known as Mamalla, who acceded the Pallava throne around 640 CE, is celebrated for the expansion of the empire, avenging the defeat his father had suffered at the hands of Pulakesin II, and inaugurating most of the building works at Mahabalipuram which is known after him as Mamallapuram.
- The shore temple at Mahabalipuram was built late r, probably in the reign of Narasimhavarman II, also known as Rajasimha who reigned from 700 to 728 CE. Now it is oriented to the east facing the ocean, but if you study it closely, you will find that it actually houses three shrines,

![[Pasted image 20211206211714.png]]


![[Pasted image 20211206211731.png]]

- two to Shiva, one facing east and the other west, and a middle one to Vishnu who is shown as Anantashayana. This is unusual, because temples generally have a single main shrineand not three areas of worship. This shows that it was probablynot originally conceived like this and different shrines mayhave been added at different times, modified perhaps withthe change of patrons. In the compound there is evidence of a water tank, an early example of a gopuram, and several other images. Sculptures of the bull, Nandi, Shiva’s mount,line the temple walls, and these, along with the carvings on the temple’s lower walls have suffered severe disfigurationdue to erosion by salt-water laden air over the centuries.

- The magnificent Shiva temple of Thanjavur, called the Rajarajeswara or Brahadeeshwarar temple, was completed around 1009 by Rajaraja Chola, and is the largest and tallest of all Indian temples. Temple building was prolificat this time, and over a hundred important temples of theChola period are in a good state of preservation, and manymore are still active shrines. Bigger in scale than anythingbuilt by their predecessors, the Pallavas, Chalukyas orPandyas, this Chola temple’s pyramidal multi-s to reyed vimana rises a massive, 70 metre (230 ft. approx) structure to pped by a monolithic shikhara which is an octagonaldome-shaped stupika. It is in this temple that one noticesfor the first time two large gopuras (gateway  towers) withan elaborate sculptural programme which was conceivedalong with the temple. Huge Nandi-figures dot the cornersof the shikhara, and the kalasha on to p by itself is aboutthree metres and eight centimetres in height. Hundredsof stucco figures decorate the vimana, although it ispossible that some of these may have been added on during the Maratha Period and did not always belong to the Chola Period. The main deity of the temple is Shiva, who is shown as a huge lingam set in a two-s to reyed sanctum. The walls surrounding the sanctum have extended mythological narratives which are depicted through painted murals and sculptures.

## Architecture in the Deccan
- Many different styles of temple architecture influenced by type both type North and South Indian temples were used in regions like Karnataka. While some scholars consider the type buildings type in this region as being distinctly either nagara or dravida, a hybridised style that seems to have become popular after the mid-seventh century, is known in some ancient texts as vesara.

- By the late seventh or the early eighth century, the ambitious projects at Ellora became even grander. By about 750 CE, the early western Chalukya control of the Deccanwas taken by the Rashtrakutas. Their greatestachievement in architecture is the Kailashnath temple atEllora, a culmination of at least a millennium-longtradition in rock-cut architecture in India. It is a complete dravida building with a Nandi shrine—since the temple isdedicated to Shiva—a gopuram-like gateway, surrounding cloisters, subsidiary shrines, staircases and an imposing  tower or vimana rising to thirty metres. Importantly, all ofthis is carved out of living rock. One portion of the monolithic hill was carved patiently to build theKailashnath temple. The sculpture of the Rashtrakutaphase at Ellora is dynamic, the figures often larger thanlife-size, infused with unparalleled grandeur and the mos to verwhelming energy.
- In the southern part of the Deccan, i.e., in the region of Karnataka is where some of the most experimental

![[Pasted image 20211206211910.png]]


![[Pasted image 20211206211934.png]]


- hybrid styles of vesara architecture are to be found. Pulakesin I established the western Chalukya kingdom when he secured the land around Badami in 543. The early western Chalukyas ruled most of the Deccan till the mid eighth century when they were superseded by the Rashtrakutas. Early Chalukyan activity also takes the form of rock-cut caves while late r activity is of structural temples. The earliest is probably the Ravana Phadi cave at Aihole which is known for its distinctive sculptural style. One of the most important sculptures at the site is of Nataraja, surrounded by larger -than-life-size depictions of the saptamatrikas: three to Shiva’s left and four to his right. The figures are characterised by graceful, slim bodies, long,oval faces to pped with extremely tall cylindrical crowns andshown to wear short dhotis marked by fine incised striationsindicating pleating. They are distinctly different from

![[Pasted image 20211206212005.png]]

![[Pasted image 20211206212021.png]]



contemporary western Deccan or Vakataka styles seen at places such as Paunar and Ramtek in Maharashtra.

- The hybridis ation and incorporation of several styles was the hallmark of Chalukyan type buildings . The most elaborate of all Chalukyan temples at Pattadakal made in the reign of Vikramaditya II (733-44) by his chief queen Loka Mahadevi is Virupaksha temple. Another important temple from this site is Papnath temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is one of the best early examples of the Dravida tradition. By contrast other eastern Chalukyan Temples, like the Mahakuta, five kilometres from Badami, and the Swarga Brahma temple at Alampur show a greater assimilation of northern styles from Odisha and Rajasthan. At the same time the Durga temple at Aihole is unique having an even earlier style of an apsidal shrine which is reminiscent of Buddhist chaitya halls and is surrounded by a veranda of a late r kind, with a shikhara that is stylistically like a nagara one. Finally, mention must be made of the Lad Khan temple at Aihole in Karnataka. This seems to be inspired by the wooden-roofed temples of the hills, except that it is constructed out of stone.

![[Pasted image 20211206212129.png]]

- How then shall we understand these different styles at one place? As curiosities or as innovations? Undoubtedly, they aredynamic expressions of a creative set ofarchitects who were competing with theirpeers in the rest of India. Whatever one’sexplanation is, these type buildings type remain of greatart-his to rical interest.

- With the waning of Chola and Pandya power, the Hoysalas of Karnataka grew to prominence in South Indiaand became the most important patrons centred at Mysore. The remains of around hundred temples have been foundin southern Deccan, though it is only three of them that are most frequently discussed: the temples at Belur, Halebidand Somnathpuram. Perhaps the most characteristicfeature of these temples is that they grow extremely complexwith so many projecting angles emerging from the previouslystraightforward square temple, that the plan of these temples starts looking like a star, and is thus known as astellate -plan. Since they are made out of soapstone whichis a relatively soft stone, the artists were able to carvetheir sculptures intricately. This can be seen particularlyin the jewellery of the gods that adorn their temple walls.

- The Hoysaleshvara temple (Lord of the Hoysalas) at Halebid in Karnataka was built in dark schist stone by the Hoysala king in 1150. Hoysala temples are sometimes called hybrid or vesara as their unique style seems neithercompletely dravida nor nagara, but somewhere in between. They are easily distinguishable from other medieval templesby their highly original star -like ground-plans and aprofusion of decorative carvings.

- Dedicated to Shiva as Nataraja, the Halebid temple is a double building with a large hall for the mandapa to facilitate music and dance. A Nandi pavilion precedes each building. The  tower of the temple here and at nearby Belur fell long ago, and an idea of the temples' appearance can now only be gleaned from their detailed miniature versions flanking the entrances. From the central square plan cut-out angular projections create the star effect decorated with the most profuse carvings of animals and deities. So intricate is the carving that it is said, for instance, in the bot to m-most frieze featuring a continuous procession of hundreds of elephants with their mahouts, no two elephants are in the same pose.

- Founded in 1336, Vijayanagara, literally ‘city of vic to ry’, attracted a number of international travellers such as theItalian, Niccolo di Conti, the Portuguese Domingo Paes,Fernao Nuniz and Duarte Barbosa and the Afghan Abdal-Razzaq, who have left vivid accounts of the city. In addition, various Sanskrit and Telugu works document thevibrant literary tradition of this kingdom. Architecturally,Vijayanagara synthesises the centuries-old dravida templearchitecture with Islamic styles demonstrated by theneighbouring sultanates. Their sculpture too, althoughfundamentally derived from, and consciously seeking to recreate Chola ideals, occasionally shows the presence offoreigners. Their eclectic ruins from the late fifteenth andearly sixteenth centuries preserve a fascinating time inhis to ry, an age of wealth, exploration and cultural fusion.
## BUDDHIST AND JAIN ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENTS
- So far, although we have focused on the nature of developments in Hindu architecture from the fifth to fourteenth centuries, it must constantly be kept in mind that this was also the very period when Buddhist and Jain developments were equally vibrant, and often went hand in-glove with Hindu ones. Sites such as Ellora have Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments; however, Badami, Khajuraho and Kannauj have the remains of any two of the religions right next to each other
.
- When the Gupta empire crumbled in the sixth century CE, this eastern region of Bihar and Bengal, his to rically known as Magadha, appears to have remained unified whilst numerous small Rajput principalities sprang up to the west. In the eighth century, the Palas came to power in the region. The second Pala ruler, Dharmapala, became immensely powerful and established an empire by defeating the powerful Rajput Pratiharas. Dharmapala consolidated an empire whose wealth lay in a combination of agriculture along the fertile Ganges plain and international trade.
- The pre-eminent Buddhist site is, of course, Bodhgaya. Bodhgaya is a pilgrimage site since Siddhartha achieved enlightenment here and became Gautama Buddha. While the bodhi tree is of immense importance, the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya is an important reminder of the brickwork of that time. The first shrine here, located at the base of the Bodhi tree, is said to have been constructed by King Ashoka; the vedika around it is said to be post-Mauryan, of about 100 BCE; many of the sculptures in the niches in the temple are dated to the eighth century Pala Period, while the actual Mahabodhi temple itself as it stands now is largely a Colonial Period reconstruction of the old seventh century design. The design of the temple is unusual. It is, strictly speaking, neither dravida or nagara. It is narrow like a nagara temple, but it rises without curving, like a dravida one.

- The monastic university of Nalanda is a mahavihara as it is a complex of several monastries of various sizes. Till date, only a small portion of this ancient learning centre has been excavated as most of it lies buried under contemporary civilis ation, making further excavations almost impossible.

- Most of the information about Nalanda is based on the records of Xuan Zang—previously spelt as ‘Hsuan-tsang’— which states that the foundation of a monastery was laidby Kumargupta I in the fifth century CE; and this wascarried forward by the late r monarchs who built up afantastic university here. There is evidence that all threeBuddhist doctrines— Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana—were taught here and monks made their way to Nalanda and its neighbouring sites of Bodhgaya andKurkihar from China, Tibet and Central Asia in the north,and Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma and various othercountries from the south-eastern parts of Asia. Monks and pilgrims would take back small sculptures and illustratedmanuscripts from here to their own countries. Buddhistmonasteries like Nalanda, thus, were prolific centres ofart production that had a decisive impact on the arts ofall Buddhist countries in Asia.
 
 - The sculptural art of Nalanda, in stucco, stone andbronze, developed out of a heavy dependence on theBuddhist Gupta art of Sarnath. By the ninth century asynthesis occurred between the Sarnath Gupta idiom, thelocal Bihar tradition, and that of central India, leading to the formation of the Nalanda school of sculpturecharacterised by distinctive facial features, body forms andtreatment of clothing and jewellery. The characteristicfeatures of Nalanda art, distinguished by its consistentlyhigh quality of workmanship, are that the precisely executed sculptures have an ordered appearance with littleeffect of crowding. Sculptures are also usually not flat inrelief but are depicted in three-dimensional forms. Theback slabs of the sculptures are detailed and theornamentations delicate. The Nalanda bronzes, dating between the seventh and eighth centuries to approximatelythe twelfth century outnumber the discovery of metalimages from all other sites of eastern India and constitutea large body of Pala Period metal sculptures. like theirstone counterparts, the bronzes initially relied heavily on Sarnath and Mathura Gupta traditions. The Nalandasculptures initially depict Buddhist deities of the Mahayanapantheon such as standing Buddhas, bodhis attvas such as Manjusri Kumara, Avalokiteshvara seated on a lotusand Naga-Nagarjuna. During the late eleventh and twelveth centuries, when Nalanda emerged as an important tantriccentre, the reper to ire came to be dominated by Vajrayanadeities such as Vajrasharada (a form of Saraswati)Khasarpana, Avalokiteshvara, etc. Depictions of crownedBuddhas occur commonly only after the tenth century.Interestingly, various brahmanical images not conforming to the Sarnath style have also been found at Nalanda,many of which are still worshipped in small temples invillages around the site.

- Sirpur in Chhattisgarh is an early-Odisha style site belonging to the period between 550 and 800, with type both type Hindu and Buddhist shrines. In many ways the iconographic and stylistic elements of the Buddhist sculptures here are similar to that of Nalanda. late r other major Buddhist monasteries developed in Odisha. Lalitagiri, Vajragiri and Ratnagiri are the most famous of them. The port- to wn of Nagapattinam was also a major Buddhist centre right until the Chola Period. One of the reasons for this must have been its importance in trade with Sri Lanka where large numbers of Buddhists still live. Bronze and stone sculptures in Chola style have come to light at Nagapattinam and generally date back to the tenth century.

- Jains were prolific temple builders like the Hindus, and their sacred shrines and pilgrimage spots are to befound across the length and breadth of India except in thehills. The oldest Jain pilgrimage sites are to be found inBihar. Many of these sites are famous for early Buddhistshrines. In the Deccan, some of the most architecturallyimportant Jain sites can be found in Ellora and Aihole.In central India, Deogarh, Khajuraho, Chanderi and Gwaliorhave some excellent examples of Jain temples. Karnataka has a rich heritage of Jain shrines and at Sravana Belagola the famous statue of Gomateshwara, the granite statue of Lord Bahubali which stands eighteen metres or fifty-seven feet high, is the world’s tallest monolithic free-standing structure. It was commissioned by Camundaraya, the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Ganga Kings of Mysore.

- The Jain temples at Mount Abu were constructed by Vimal Shah. Notable for a simplistic exterior in contrast with the exuberant marble interiors, their rich sculptural decoration with deep undercutting creates a lace-like appearance. The temple is famous for its unique patternson every ceiling, and the graceful bracket figures along thedomed ceilings. The great Jain pilgrimage site in theShatrunjay hills near Palitana in Kathiawar, Gujarat, isimposing with scores of temples clustered to gether.

- In this chapter we have read about the prolific sculptural and architectural remains in different types of stone, terracotta and bronze from the fifth to the fourteenth centuries. Undoubtedly there would have been sculpturesmade of other media like silver and gold, but these wouldhave been melted down and reused. Many sculptures wouldalso have been made of wood and ivory, but these haveperished because of their fragility. Often sculptures wouldhave been painted, but again, pigments cannot alwayssurvive hundreds of years, especially if the sculptures wereexposed to the elements. There was also a rich tradition ofpainting at this time, but the only examples that survivefrom this period are murals in a few religious type buildings .

- Mahabalipuram is an important coastal to wn from the of the Pallavas. It is dotted with several important rock-cut and free-standing structural temples mostly made in the seventh and eighth centuries. This large sculptural panel, one of the largest and oldest known irl the world, is nearly thirty metres long and fifteen metres high. There is a natural cleft in the rw•k which has been cleverly used by its sculp to rs as a channel for water to flow down. This water collects in a massive tank in front of the sculpted wall.

- Scholars have interpreted the s to ry depicted on the panel differently. While some believe that it is the s to ry of the descent of the Ganga from heaven to earth, others ERIieve that the main s to ry is of Kiratarjuniya or Arjuna's penance, a poetic work by Bharvi which is known to have been popular in the Pallava court. Other scholars have interpreted the symbolism the sculptures to show that the whole tableau was created to be a prashasti, or something to praise the Pallava king, who, they say, would have sat enthroned in the tank in front of this extraordinary backdrop

- A temple has been given prominence in the relief. Ascetics and worshippers sit before it. Above it is an emaciated bearded figure standing in penance on one leg, his arms raised above his head. He has been identified by some as Bhagirath and by others as Arjuna. Arjuna's penance was toobtain the pashupata weapon from Shiva, whereas Bhagirath prayed to have Ganga brought to earth. Next to this figure stands Shiva who has one hand in the EX'on bes to wing gesture or varada mudra. The small gana or dwarf who starlds below this hand may a personification of the pashupata weapon.

- All the figures are shown with a slender and linear quality in an animated state of movement. Apart from humans and flying celestials there are several naturalistically carved birds and animals as well. Particularly noteworthy are the extraordinarily well-modelled, and life- like elephants, and the pair Of deer who are under the shrine. The most humorous, however, is a cat who has been shown standing on his hind legs, with his hands raised, imitating Bhagirath or Arjuna. Close examination, however, reveals that this cat is, in fact, a symbolic device. He is surrounded by rats, which are unable to disturb him from his penance. Perhaps this is a metaphor used by the artist to show how strong Arjuna's or Bhagirath's penarlce was, who is also standing still, undisturbed by his surrounding s.

- The theme of Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha has been depicted several times in the caves of Ellora. But the most noteworthy of all is the one depicted on the left wall of Kailashnath temple (Cave No.16) at Ellora. The image is dated to the eighth century CE. It is a colossal sculpture and is considered as one of the masterpieces of Indian sculpture. It depicts the episode of Ravanashaking Mount Kailasha when Lord Shiva alongwith Parvati and others were on the mountain. The composition is divided in to several tiers. Thelower tier depicts Ravana, multi-faced and multi armed shaking the mount with ease. The depthof carvings of the multiple hands brings out theeffect of three-dimensional space. Ravana’s bodyis angular pushing one leg inside. The hands areexpanded on the sides of the inside chambercreated by the image of Ravana. The upper halfis divided in to three frames. The centre occupied by the image of Shiva and Parvati. Parvati isshown moving close to Shiva scared by thecommotion on the hill. Her stretched legs andslightly twisted body in the recessed space createa very dramatic effect of light and shade. Thevolume of sculpture is very pronounced; theattendant fiures are equally voluminous. Thegana (dwarf) figures are shown in action, involvedin their activities. The celestial beings aboveShiva and Parvati witnessing the event areshown in frozen movement. Protrusion of volumeand recession in the space are importantlandmarks in the images of the Ellora caves.Light and darkness has been exploited bycreating the images in full round. Their to rsos are slender with heaviness in its surfacetreatment, arms are slim in full round. Attendantfigures on the two sides have angular frontality.Every image in the composition is beautifullyinterwoven structurally with each other.

- temples at Khaj uraho are all made of sandstone. They were patronised by the Chandella dynasty. The Lakshmana temple represents the full- fledged. developed style of temple architecture during the time of the Chandellas. Its construction was completed by 954. the year as per the inscription found at the base of the temple. by Yashovarman. the seventh ruler of the Chandella dynasty. The temple plan is of a panchayana type . The temple is constructed on a heavy plinth. It consists of anardharnandapa (1Mjrch). rnandcqxz the maha mandapa (greater hall)and the garbhagriha with vimana. Each part has a separate roof risingbackward. All the halls have projected porches on their walls but are notaccessible to visi to rs. Their use is functional, mainly for light andventilation. The oute+ walls of the garbhagriha and the outer and innerwalls around the circumambula to ry path are decorated with sculptures. The shikhara on the garbhagriha is tall. The Khajuraho temples are alsoknown for their erotic sculptures. Many erotic sculptures are carved on the plinth wall. Some erotic sculptures are cawed on the actual wall of the temple. Tier arrangements on the walls provide a very spacefor the placement of the images. The interior halls are also decoratedprofusely. The entrance to the garbhagriha is sculpted with heavyvoluminous pillars and lintels carved with small images as part of thedoor decoration. An image Of Chaturmukha Vishnu is in the garbhagriha. There are four shrines in each corner Of the temple. There are images OfVishnu in three shrines and Surya in one. which can be identified by thecentral image on the lintel of the shrine-doors. Drapery and ornamentsare given a lot of attention.

- A large number of bronze scupltures have been found in the country which shall be discussed in the next chapter.We have focussed on the dominant art styles and someof the most famous monuments from different parts of Indiain the medieval period. It is important to realise that theenormous artistic achievements that we have studied herewould never have been possible if artists worked alone. These large projects would have brought architects,builders, sculp to rs and painters to gether.

- Above all, by studying these artworks, we are able to learn much about the kind of society that made these objects. Through them we can surmise what their type buildings type were like , what types of clothes they wore and above allwe can use the art material to reconstruct the his to ry of their religions. These religions, as we have seen were manyand diverse and constantly changing. Hinduism, Buddhismand Jainism each have a plethora of gods and goddesses,and this was the period when bhakti and tantra — twomajor developments, affected them. Temples also becamea space for many other art forms, such as music and danceand, from the tenth century onwards, temples became largelandowners as kings and feudal lords gave them land for their maintenance once and upkeep, and performed an administrative role as well.
