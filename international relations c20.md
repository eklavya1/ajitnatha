## international criminal court(ICC)
(2.45 pm)
hq at hague, netherlands.
it has 124 member counties, with malaysia most recent 1 to join.
it has been established through rome statute 2002.
it has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for international crimes & war crimes.
it's intended to complement existing national judicial system.

reasons for india not joining ICC:
domestic judicial system is component enough to try high profile cases if need arises.
india wanted use of nuclear weapons & sponsor terrorism to be designated as crimes within preview of ICC.
india suffers from insurgency in northeast & militancy in kashmir & punjab.
by joining ICC india did not want to make its military & civil personnel vulnerable to international jurisdiction.
also as a matter of principle, india did not join ICC as rome statute provides extraordinary power to p5 countries to bind non-state parties to ICC.
it violates vienna convention on laws of treaties that no state will be forced to join or be bound by a treaty.

## assessment of performance of UN
(3.20 pm)
to ensure peace mechanisms available were:
collective security:
it's based on theme "all for 1 & 1 for all" that is if there is act of aggression by 1 nation against another, all countries or member states of UN will come together to wage a war against aggressor.
responsibility of operationalizing collective security has been restored upon unsc.
however, since unsc remains paralyzed due to p2 vs p3, collective security was rationalized very rarely(once during gulf war, when ussr foll its disintegration choose to abstain).
since collective security could not be operationalized even during korean conflict, unga suggest innovation in form of uniting for peace resolution.
uniting for peace resolution:
under this in case of a deadlock in unsc, unga can authorize a collective security operation subjected that such a resolution is passed by 2/3rd majority in unga.
however, since it would imply overriding of p5 countries, this suggestion was not acceptable to ussr, & therefore uniting for peace resolution was never operationalized.
peacekeeping operations:
it was brainchild of dag hammarskjold(2nd UN 2nd secretary-general of united nations).
peacekeeping operation vs collective security:
collective security: 	peacekeeping operation:
policing action 	military action.
to maintain ceasefire 	to punish aggressor

it requires consent of parties in dispute
	no such consent is required.
challenges faced by peacekeeping operation:
rise in intra-state conflicts rather than inter-state conflicts.
non-state actors are involved & imposing accountability on them becomes difficult.
developed countries fund peacekeeping mission while developing countries provide troops.
however, decision regarding operations is taken by p5 countries.
with rise of intra-state countries, peacekeeping missions have become more dangerous thus troop-contributing countries demand their active involvement concerning peacekeeping operations & their mandates.
developed countries have suggested what is referred to as "robust peacekeeping", blue helmets are expected to fight against non-state actors.
but it has been rejected by developing countries since it goes against very idea of peacekeeping.
india's role in peacekeeping operation:
