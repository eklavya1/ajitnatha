Robotics was discussed (1.11 PM)

Dictation (1.46 PM)

Robotics- is the science and engineering of manufacturing and application of robots.
It is an interdisciplinary branch that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science and others.
It has various applications:
Agriculture- robots can be used even in harsh terrain areas.
They can be used for sowing, thrashing, weeding out pests, as well as a scarecrow to prevent the attack of wild stray animals.
Replacement of human labor
Hazardous work- Machines can be employed in areas that pose great risks to human health and safety.
Eg- coal mining, handling nuclear and chemical waste, manual scavenging, bomb disposal squads etc.
Monotonous jobs- in assembly lines in manufacturing, jobs can be taken up by robots and human labor can be engaged in more challenging and skill-enhancing jobs
Rescue work â€“ robots can be employed in dangerous sites like edges of buildings and fire-affected areas to rescue people.
Space robotics:
Interplanetary and lunar missions will not be possible without robots.
Logistics
Warehouse management, inventory management, and delivery of goods.
Manufacturing- modern manufacturing is shifting towards automation which will limit the job creation ability of the manufacturing sector.
Disaster management- delivering food packets and monitoring flood-prone areas.
Security and defense also- surveillance of national borders, high altitude areas, Maoist areas, high altitude areas.
Medical application- Robotically assisted surgery.

Job vs. automation issue (2.02 PM)

India is in a race against demography as well as robots. In other words, it will have to figure out how to create jobs for the millions who join the labour force every year at a time when robots are becoming adept at performing a range of human tasks.
Robots can replace humans because of the following reasons.
Robots increase the supply of total effective labor. They can work for more hours without any leaves.
They can be more efficient than human labor.
The impact of automation can be very diverse and the nature of change is difficult to predict. Eg- even if the output in the economy increases, the inequality will worsen.
The following points can be used to defend automation:
Fear of disruptive technology is not new.
The Luddite movement called for the destruction of machines to save jobs.
In 2005, bank unions started protesting against the computerization of banks.
There was widespread fear of job losses.
Nothing of this sort happens and our banking experience has improved.
Lump of labor fallacy:
economists use this term to the common mistakes that only limited work can be done in an economy.
However, a new form of job always crops up because human needs are virtually unlimited compared to the supply of labor.
Everyone is a consumer and thus a policy must think from the perspective of a consumer.
Way forward:
The effect of machines on labor depends on the nature of technical change.
Some are beneficial to laborers while others are not.
Thus, a policy must be very cautious before coming to a final stand on the issue of automation.
Robots can be deployed in prohibitive areas.
However, automation for semi-skilled and unskilled jobs can be postponed and in the meantime, the government must focus on skill development programs.
Also, there should be social security protection for people who will lose their jobs because of automation.

Data protection regime (3.14 PM)

Data fiduciary- there should be trust.
Data collectors should not break the trust and divulge the data.
Data protection regime- It is a set of strategies and processes that secure the privacy, availability, and integrity of someoneâ€™s data.
In this digital era, where every person has a digital footprint on apps and websites and very little control over how their personal data is going to be used by data collectors, the data protection regime becomes even more significant.
In this context, European Union took a lead and came up with 7 principles as part of the General Data Protection Regime.
Principles-
lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.
Data should be collected in a lawful manner.
Purpose limitation- when data is collected from a subject the purpose of data processing must be specified.
Data minimization- personal data for the processing which is being collected should be adequate and relevant to the extent it is necessary.
Accuracy- holding inaccurate data of individuals is against law.
Storage limitation For how long data will be stored. Every collected data has an expiration date after which the data collector loses the right to store the data.
Integrity and confidentiality
Accountability- it implies that the data collector will be responsible for every step of data processing.
Data localization- the data should be stored in the country of origin.
Issues with respect to data localization
Additional costs
Other countries perceive that India is vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
As per the RBI- financial transactions should be stored in India. 

The topic for the next class: IPR, Defense technology.
