A brief discussion on the Prelims exam 2021 from Environment Perspective (1:07 PM)

No. of Questions asked from Environment and Ecology: 24 (Primary Producer of Marine ecosystem; cyanobacteria; water cycle; Phosphorus cycle, etc)
Questions asked were both static and related to Current Affairs
An interdisciplinary approach is needed
# Wetlands
(1:18 PM)
- A wetland is a land inundated or submerged or saturated with water, seasonal or permanent, freshwater or brackish water or saltwater.
- A wetland supports hydrophytic vegetation, i.e. submerged or floating aquatic plants.
- The topsoil of a wetland is saturated with water leading to anaerobic conditions which cause breakdown or decomposition of organic matter. Nutrients get cycled.
- Types of Wetland:
- Inland and Coastal
- Inland-> Natural and Artificial
- Coastal-> Natual and Artificial
- Wetland Examples
- Swamp, Marsh, Bog, Lake, Flood Plain Area, Reservoir, Aquaculture, Paddyfield, Mangrove, etc.
- Importance of Wetlands
- Resources such as fish, prawns, oysters, etc-> support the livelihood of the people.
- Recycling of wastes (called kidneys of the earth)
- Recharge of groundwater aquifer
- Linked to various nutrient cycles or support processes of nutrient cycles
- Moderation of Climate
- Protection from natural calamities. eg- Mangrove forest prevents soil erosion, protects from cyclones, tsunami, etc.
- It provides habitat to various types of bird species (Resident and Migratory); amphibians; Reptiles; Mammals, etc.
- Linked to cultural and religious values of local communities.
- Threats to Wetlands (2:09 PM)
- Encroachment to wetlands-> rapid population growth, urbanization, industrialization, etc leading to conversion of wetlands to other forms (changes in land use pattern)
- Overexploitation of wetland resources
- Eutrophication of wetlands-> results in algal boom causing a high level of BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)
- Invasive Alien Speicies
- Sedimentation/Siltation
- Climate change impacts on wetlands
# Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (2:29 PM)

It is an intergovernmental convention to conserve and manage wetlands worldwide.
It was signed on 2 February 1971 at Ramsar in Iran. That date is celebrated as World Wetland Day.
Hosted by UNESCO.
Objectives: a) wise use of wetlands. b)designation of Ramsar sites of international importance. c) conservation and management of shared water resources and transboundary wetlands.
Montreux record
# List of threatened wetlands (Ramsar sites)
A wetland is said to have been threatened where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur as a result of technological developments, pollution, or other human interference.
Ramsar Advisory Mission (RAM) study threats and recommend action plan to conserve and manage listed threatened Ramsar site.
Chillika Lagoon (Odisha) was added and later removed from Montreux Records.
Keoladeo and Loktak lake are presently in Montreux Record.
9 Criteria to declare Ramsar Site (3:27 PM)
Group A
Representative, rare and unique type of wetlands.
Group B
Support endangered, vulnerable, or critically endangered species
Support plant and animal species important for maintaining the biodiversity of the biogeographic region.
Plant and Animal species at critical life stage or provide refuge during adverse conditions.
Supports 20,000 or more waterbirds 
Supports 1% of individuals of a population of species of water birds
Supports population of indigenous fish
Source of food, spawning ground, nursery for fishes
Other taxa
Wetland sites in India-> explained through Map (Ref: Envis website)

# Wetland Conservation and Management Rules (3:56 PM)

Notified under EPA 1986
Provisions:
National wetland Authority of India (NWAI) and SWAI
Strict punishment for causing harm to wetlands
Database of wetlands in India
Notification of wetlands for conservation by SWAI within one year

The topic for the next class: Wildlife Protection and management Acts, Project Tiger, etc.
