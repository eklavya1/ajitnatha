- The **pamir mountains** are a mountain range between [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. It is located at a junction with other notable mountains, namely the Tian Shan, Karakoram, Kunlun, Hindu Kush and the Himalaya mountain ranges. They are among the world's highest mountains.
- Much of the Pamir Mountains lie in the Gorno-Badakhshan Province of [[Tajikistan]]. To the south, they border the [[Hindu Kush mountains]] along Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in Badakhshan Province. To the north, they join the Tian Shan mountains along the Alay Valley of Kyrgyzstan. To the east, they extend to the range that includes China's Kongur Tagh, in the "Eastern Pamirs", separated by the Yarkand valley from the Kunlun Mountains.
