It is also known as Act X of 1891 , was legislation enacted in British India on 19 March 1891 which raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse for all girls, married or unmarried, from ten to twelve years in all jurisdictions, its violation subject to criminal prosecution as rape.
In 1891, BM Malabari's efforts bore fruit when the age of Consent was enacted which prohibited the marriage of a girl child of the age of 12 years.
The law targeted the Hindu practice of child marriage.
The Age of Consent Act, 1891 was an amendment of the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 375, 1882, and was introduced as a bill on 9 January 1891 by Sir Andrew Scoble.
It received support from Indian reformers such as Behramji Malabari and women's social organisations and was opposed by Hindu nationalists including Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
The 1860 Indian Penal Code set the age at 10 years which was increased to 12 years with this Act.
It was debated the same day and opposed by council member Sir Romesh Chunder Mitter on the grounds that it interfered with the orthodox Hindu code, but was supported by council member Rao Bahadur Krishnaji Lakshman Nulkar and by the President of the council, the Govemor-General and Viceroy Lord Lansdowne.
While an 1887 case in a Bombay high court of a child-bride Rukhmabai renewed discussion of such a law it was the death of an eleven-year-old Bengali girl, Phulmoni Dasi, due to forceful intercourse by her 35-year-old husband in 1889 that drove intervention by the British.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak opposed the bill stating "We would not like that the government should have anything to do with regulating our social customs or ways of living, even supposing that the act of government will be a very beneficial and suitable measure".
