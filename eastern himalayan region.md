The Eastern Himalayan region consists of Sikkim, Darjeeling area (West Bengal), Arunachal Pradesh, Assam hills, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura.
It is characterized by rugged topography, thick forest cover, and sub-humid climate (rainfall over 200 cm; temperature July 250C-330C, January 110C-240C).
The soil is brownish, thick layered, and less fertile.
Shifting cultivation (Jhum) is practiced in nearly 1/ 3 of the cultivated area and food crops are raised mainly for sustenance.
Rice, potato, maize, tea, and fruits (orange, pineapple, lime, litchi, etc.) are the main crops.
The ecological system of the region is problematic.
The region needs marked improvement in infrastructural facilities to accelerate the pace of development.
Soil degradation should be arrested by controlling deforestation and by terracing in hills.
The run-off should be checked and water conserved should be utilised in minor irrigation.
Shifting cultivation should be controlled by encouraging permanent settlement.
A program to grow fruits above 30% slopes in the hills needs to be framed.
Supporting activities of sericulture, handicrafts poultry, and piggery, etc. should be promoted.
A long-term quality seed production plan should be implemented to assure an adequate supply of quality seeds to the farmers.
