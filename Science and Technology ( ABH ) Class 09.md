Science and Technology ( ABH ) Class 09

A brief review of the previous class and doubts. (1:13 PM)

Polar Sun-Synchronous Orbit (PSSO): (1:27 PM)

Satellites orientation is fixed relative to the sun throughout the year 
Whenever the satellite observes a ground location, the sun is always in the same location in the sky 
This ensures that observation of a location on earth by satellite occurs in the same lighting and shadow 
Scientists can compare images over several years without worrying too much about extreme changes in shadow and lighting 
Such orbits are at the altitude of 600-800 Km with an inclination of 96-98*

How sun-synchronous Orbit is achieved:

Earth is not a perfect sphere and because of that satellite orbits themselves change 
Such type of motion is called precision or nodal regression 
In a sun-synchronous orbit, the nodal regression cancels out the daily change in position of the sun over any point on earth caused by the earth revolving around the sun 
360* regression in 365 days - So daily regression (change in orbit) ie 1* every day which is useful for earth observation satellites 

Types of Satellite: (2:18 PM)

Communication Satellite: (2:45 PM)

It relays and amplifies radio telecommunication via a transponder
It creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on earth
These satellites are generally kept in geosynchronous orbits 
CMS 01, GSAT 30 and GSAT 31 are the latest communication satellites launched by ISRO 

Topics for the next class: Continuation of satellites, Launch Vehicles, etc
