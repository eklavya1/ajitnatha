- The standards are decided by [[International Telecommunication Union]] and 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)
- 3GPP - It is a partnership of 7 telecommunications [[development]] organizations of the [[world]].
- TSDSI - Telecommunication Standard Development Society of India is the member.
- Note: 3GPP is an independent organization. TSDSI is also independent.

## Technologies used in 5G
- Use of millimeters waves - 5G is going to use high frequency with a wavelength in millimeters.
- Small cells stations- as higher frequency travels less distance for telecommunication more (more than previous generations) number of small cells stations will be used for seamless coverage.
- Massive MIMO- one station can receive and emit waves simultaneously.
- Beamforming - signals sent by small cells will be directional in nature rather than being emitted in all possible directions.
- This ensures signal strength as well as minimizes interference among signals.
- Edge computing- to be discussed in upcoming lectures.
- Network slicing- the same network which is used for various purposes. _related_ [[zipf's law]] | [[metcalfe's law]] | [[]] 

## Challenges in 5G
- General challenges:
- There is a fear of health damage to humans, animals especially to birds because of 5G radiations.
- Even though a lot of this fear is exaggerated, the long-term impact of exposure to mm waves is not known because we do not have enough data.

Challenges in India:
	- Telecom companies are in huge debt. Thus private investment in 5G is very less.
	- Spectrum prices in India are one of the highest in the world.
	- Equipment required for 5G is not manufactured in India. So, we are dependent on imports.
	- There is a lack of policy framework which has delayed infrastructure development in the country.
	- There is a threat associated with the Chinese made 5G because that many countries including India have not allowed 5G trials led by Huawei.

## Supercomputers
(2:24 PM)
- Supercomputers are embodiments of high-performance computing, allowing organizations to solve complicated problems such as weather prediction, climate modeling, big data analytics, disaster management simulation among others.
- A supercomputer is different from an ordinary computer because it splits a problem into many pieces and work on them simultaneously.
- This is called parallel processing.
- An ordinary computer does things in a distinct series of operations called serial processing.
- The capacity of an ordinary computer is measured in MIS (million instructions per second) while for a supercomputer we use flops (Floating line operations per second).

### Supercomputing in India
- 1st supercomputer in India was **Param 8000**. #pre  _related_ [[george friedman]] | [[computer]] | [[Hacking]]
- Pratyush and Mihir are 2 powerful supercomputers of India with a focus on weather forecasting. #pre 
- In [[2015]], the government envisaged a National Supercomputing mission with the following features:
	- To establish supercomputing facilities across 70 research and academic institutions.
	- Connecting them on a _national knowledge network_.
	- It will be implemented by CDAC (center for the development of advanced computing under MEITY) and IISC Bengaluru.
	- The funds will come from MEITY and the Department of Science and Technology.
	- It aims to make India a world leader in supercomputing. 

### Challenges in supercomputing in India
(2:37)
- Funding- by the end of [[2018]], only [[10%]] of the total budget of the national supercomputing mission was released.
- To procure hardware components for supercomputers for imports
- Supercomputers are not environment friendly as they consume a lot of power as well as water for their cooling requirement.
- Supercomputers in India- Param Siddhi, Param Shivay, Param Brahma #pre 
- Refer to the handout.

## Edge computing
(2:57 PM)
- Cloud computing - the term cloud means internet.
- A group of people can work on the same project despite being in different locations is possible due to cloud computing.
- Normal computers can store only a limited amount of data.
- In edge computing, the data is processed and stored at the edge of the network that is local. _related_ [[=the next 100 years book|computer]] | [[computer]] | [[internet]] 
- As opposed to cloud computing where data is stored and processed on central cloud servers.
- Because of the exponential increase in IoT devices, the cloud servers are overloaded as well as the latency increases.
- Edge computing solves both of these problems- it reduces latency and only useful processed data is sent to central servers, rest of the data is deleted.

## Quantum Technologies
(3:09 PM explanation)
(3:44 PM- dictation was provided)
- It seeks to harness laws of quantum physics that describe the behavior of matter at atomic and subatomic levels.
- It has various applications such as quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum communication, and meteorology.

- A quantum computer is entirely different from a classical computer in the following ways:
	- The classical computer operates using binary digits (0,1) known as bits, while a quantum computer uses qubits for the same purpose.
	- Qubit is a superposition state of 0 and 1.
	- Qubits can also be entangled with each other that is the change in one qubit will automatically change other entangled qubits.
	- As the number of qubits increase, the computational capacity of quantum computers increases exponentially.
	- Thus a quantum computer can be used to solve complicated problems of the world.

- Quantum supremacy- only for one problem it has been possible.
- Quantum simulation- how atoms and molecules behave.
- Challenges:
	- As the number of qubits increase, their manipulation becomes more difficult.
	- Sycamore is a quantum processor developed by google which has 53 qubits.
	- Quantum properties are completely lost if there is any outside interference because of that quantum computers need to be isolated and kept at very low temperatures.
