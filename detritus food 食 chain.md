• Detritus food chains starts from dead organic matter of decaying animals and plant bodies consumed by the micro-organisms and then to detritus feeding organism called detrivores or decomposer and to other predators.
 • The distinction between the grazing food chain and detritus food chains is the source of energy for the first-level consumers. In the grazing food chain the primary source of energy is living plant biomass while in the detritus food chain the source of energy is dead organic matter or detritus. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
 • Fungi and Bacteria are decomposers. They break down organic matter into simple inorganic substances. On the other hand, virus represents dormant life. They are metabolically inactive as long as they are outside a host body. They are not decomposers. They invade host cells and use their nucleus (DNA machinery) to carry out their life processes. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
 • This type of food chain acquires energy from detritus, utilizing the detritus to its fullest, with minimum wastage. Compared to other kinds of food chains, the detritus food chain has much larger energy flow in a terrestrial [[ecosystem]].
