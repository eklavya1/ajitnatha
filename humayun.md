- [[humayun]] tomb, built in [[1570]], is of particular cultural significance as it was first garden tomb on indian subcontinent. it inspired several major architectural innovations, culminating in construction of taj mahal.
- humayun’s garden-tomb is an example of *charbagh* (a four-quadrant garden with four rivers of quranic paradise represented), with pools joined by channels. 
- mausoleum itself stands on a high, wide terraced platform with two bay deep vaulted cells on all four sides. it has an irregular octagon plan with four long sides and chamfered edges.
- it is surmounted by a 42.5 m high double dome clad with marble flanked by pillared kiosks (chhatris) and domes of central chhatris are adorned with glazed ceramic tiles.
- interior is a large octagonal chamber with vaulted roof compartments interconnected by galleries or corridors. this octagonal plan is repeated on second storey. structure is of dressed stone clad in red sandstone with white and black inlaid marble borders.
- humayun’s garden-tomb is also called ‘dormitory of mughals’ as in cells are buried over 150 mughal family members.
- [[humayun]]'s' tomb was built thanks to initiative of his widow hamida banu begum, who commenced construction of a mausoleum for her deceased husband in [[1565]], nine years after his death. construction was finished in [[1570]]s.
