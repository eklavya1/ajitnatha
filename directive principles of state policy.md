part iv of the indian constitution deals with directive principles of our state policy (dpsp).
the provisions contained in this part cannot be enforced by any court, but these principles are fundamental in the govemance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply these principles in making laws.

 directive principles of state policy can be classified into three broad categories, viz, socialistic, gandhian and liberal–intellectual.
**socialistic principles:** these principles reflect the ideology of [[socialism]]. they lay down the framework of a democratic [[socialist]] state, aim at providing social and economic justice, and set the path towards [[welfare state]].
**gandhian principles:** these principles are based on gandhian ideology. they represent the programme of reconstruction enunciated by [[gandhi]] during the national movement. in order to fulfil the dreams of [[gandhi]], some of his ideas were included as directive principles.
**liberal–intellectual principles:** the principles included in this category represent the ideology of liberalism. they direct the state: to secure for all citizens a uniform civil code throughout the country ([[article]] 44). to provide early childhood care and [[education]] for all children until they complete the age of six years ([[article]] 45).
to organise [[agriculture]] and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines (article 48).
to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard forests and wild life (article 48 a).
