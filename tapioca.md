tapioca (; portuguese: [tapiˈɔkɐ]) is a starch extracted from storage roots of cassava plant (manihot esculenta, also known as manioc), a species native to north & northeast regions of [[brazil]], but whose use is now spread throughout [[south america]]. it is a perennial shrub adapted to hot conditions of tropical lowlands. cassava copes better with poor soils than many other food plants.

tapioca is a staple food for millions of people in tropical countries. it provides only carbohydrate food value, & is low in protein, vitamins & minerals. in other countries, it is used as a thickening agent in various manufactured foods.
