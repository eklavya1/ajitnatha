Sorghum, (Sorghum bicolour), also called great millet, Indian millet, and its edible starchy seeds-
The plant likely originated in Africa, where it is a major food crop and has numerous varieties, including grain sorghums, used for food; grass sorghums, grown for hay and fodder; and broomcom, used in making brooms and brushes.
In India sorghum is known as jowar, cholam, or jonna, in West Africa as Guinea com, and in China as kaoliang. Sorghum is especially valued in hot and arid regions for its resistance to drought and heat Hence, Option 1 is the correct answer.
Sorghum is a highly drought-tolerant crop and has been increasingly used as a model cereal to identify genes that confer tolerance. Also, there is considerable natural variation in resistance to drought in different sorghum genotypes-

Sorghum is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the grass family (Poaceae). Some of these species are grown as cereals for human consumption and some in pastures for animals. One species, Sorghum bicolor, was originally domesticated in Africa and has since spread throughout the globe. Seventeen of the 25 species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. One species is grown for grain, while many others are used as fodder plants, either cultivated in warm climates worldwide or naturalized in pasture lands. Sorghum is in the subfamily Panicoideae and the tribe Andropogoneae (the tribe of big bluestem and sugarcane).
