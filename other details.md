- [[megasthenes]] in his book [[indika]] wrote that 7 castes were present in the mauryan society but it seems that he was confused b/w caste & profession
- these castes were
	1. [[philosopher]]
	2. councillors
	3. magistrates
	4. priests (shramana)
	5. herdsman or shepherds
	6. artisans
	7. service class
- perhaps Ashoka was the first indian monarch to create a wildlife sanctuary for the protection of animals #pre
