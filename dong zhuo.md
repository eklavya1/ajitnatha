- dong zhuo (pronunciation ) (died 22 may 192), courtesy name zhongying, was a chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived in the late eastern han dynasty. at the end of the reign of the eastern han, dong zhuo was a general and powerful minister of the imperial government. yet he forced the young emperor shao of han to abdicate and replaced him with his half-brother emperor xian of han while he sought to become the de facto ruler of china in the boy-emperor's name. the eastern han dynasty regime survived in name only.dong zhuo seized control of the imperial capital luoyang in 189 when it entered a state of turmoil following the death of emperor ling of han and a massacre of the eunuch faction by the court officials led by general-in-chief he jin. dong zhuo subsequently deposed liu bian (emperor shao) and replaced him with his half-brother, the puppet emperor xian of han. dong zhuo's rule was brief and characterized by cruelty and tyranny. in the following year, a coalition of regional officials (cishi) and warlords launched a campaign against him. failing to stop the coalition forces, dong zhuo sacked luoyang and relocated further west to the former western han capital at chang'an (modern xi'an, shaanxi province). he was assassinated soon after in 192 by his subordinate l√º bu in a plot orchestrated by interior minister wang yun.
