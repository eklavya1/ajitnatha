## govt budget
(9:15 am)
govt budget has 2 parts- revenue budget & capital budget.
revenue budget further has 2 parts- revenue receipts & revenue expenditure.
revenue receipts are of 2 kinds- tax receipts ( income tax, corporate tax, etc.) & non-tax receipts (fees, fines, etc.)
revenue budget also consists of revenue expenditure (salaries, pensions, etc.)
similarly, capital budget has 2 parts- capital receipts (disinvestment proceedings, loans raised, etc.) & capital expenditures ( repayment of loans, acquiring new machinery, etc).
![[pic government budget.png]]

## govt deficits
- 9:43 am
- budget deficits= total expenditure - total revenue.
- total expenditure= revenue expenditure + capital expenditure.
- total receipts = revenue receipts + capital receipts.

- let us assume dt govt wishes to spend 120 crores & earn 100 crores in a year.

- out of balance of 20 crores, govt wishes to borrow 10 crores fm market & balance of 10 crores wd be financed by rbi.
- latter 10 crores'll be c/a *“monetised deficit”*. [[monetised deficit]]
- fr monetized deficit, rbi'll print & release mr currency notes, as / new amounts of bonds released by govt. 

## ways & means advances (wma)
10:31 pm
- in wma agreement [[1997]], [[government]] resolved to:
	- never present a deficit budget.
	- rbi'll nt be md to monetize govt deficits by printing mr [[money]], in return fr govt bonds.

- wma agreement mentioned dt rbi cn lend money to govt fr some short time to tide over temporary liquidity mismatches.

- ds is mainly be b/c though expenses of govt are continuous, receipts happen at irregular loans. (ie *aamdani athananni kharcha rupaiyaa*)
- govt & rbi'll decide maximum limit wch cn be borrowed by govt, time period of borrowing, every year.
- both central & state govts cn use facility.
- central govt cn print [[treasury bill]]s (very short duration security), govt bonds.
- state govts cannot issue treasury bills as state govts hv lesser ability to redeem short-term securities than central govt.

## deficits
10:45 ammei 
- deficits refer  
- to deficiency, i.e, excess of expenditure over wt 1 receives. in context of govt, there are foll deficits:

## budget deficit
- it's equal to total expenditure(revenue expenditure+ capital expenditure) – total receipts( revenue receipts + capital receipts)
- a budget deficit's expression of total expenditure dt [[government]] expects to incur is mr than total receipts, including borrowings dt govt expects to receive.

- it's expression of intention dt govt has planned to spend much mr than wt it plans to receive.
- it's thus a tool to achieve political goals by presenting a populist budget w/o any accountability with respect to how'll these promises be fulfilled.

## monetized deficit
- it's dt part of budget deficit wch is monetized by rbi through printing of money is c/a a monetized deficit.

## analysis:
- monetization is done when govt prints govt bonds & forces rbi to buy them & print money in exchange.
- as a result, rbi’s decision with respect to money supply is nt it's own.i/e/ nt based on its own assessment regarding its objectives, rather it's forced upon it by govt.
- thus, rbi’s independence is compromised. further due to ds printing of currency, rbi’s ability to control inflation, ensure stability & trust in currency gets deteriorated.
- ds is due to unsustainable borrowing by govt, & its own ability to fulfill its promises with respect to govt bonds.

## ways & means advances agreement
- in [[1997]], govt & rbi reached agreement _ wch govt agreed to nt present a budget deficit, & thus nt force [[rbi]] to monetize it.
- ds was done to restore credibility of rbi as independent monetary policy.
- _ this, rbi'll lend to govt but only to help govt to tide over temporary mismatches in liquidity.
- need arises as govt has to incur expenses continuously, whereas its receipts are periodic.

- such arrangement is there with both center & state govts wch decide, in advance, with rbi about amount dt rbi is expected to lend fr - coming yr to them.
- ds amount is lent to some extent on unsecured basis & beyond dt against govt securities.
- fr a short duration, & lent usually ar [[repo rate]].
- central govt cn issue [[treasury bill]]s, short-duration govt securities, or govt bonds, whereas state govts cannot issue treasury bills.

## fiscal responsibility & budget management (frbm) act 2003
- all states hv their own FRBLs (fiscal responsibility & budget legislations) too.
- *act pertains to a self-imposed discipline in borrowing.*

## fiscal deficit
- 11:44 am
- it's total borrowing of govt in a financial year,
- ds is total debt capital receipts.

- since there is no budget deficit now,

total expenditure = total revenue

revenue expenditure + capital expenditure= revenue receipts + capital receipts

capital receipts wd be equal to (non-debt capital receipts + debt capital receipts)

so finally, fiscal deficit wd be:

- (revenue expenditure+ capital expenditure)-( revenue receipts + nondebt capital receipts)
- which is equal to debt capital receipts= total expenditure- total non-debt receipts.
- it's a flow variable, while debt is a stock variable.

- net fiscal deficit= fiscal deficit (or gross fiscal deficit) – lending by govt.

- out of total money dt govt borrows, c/a fiscal or gross fiscal deficits, we subtract lending done by govt to various entities such as state govts or foreign govts.
- ds leads to another measure of deficit c/a net fiscal deficit.

- primary deficits= fiscal deficit – interest payments.

- largest part of govt expenditure its interest payments.
- also, these are committed expenses, i.e. govt does nt hv much discretion over them.
- interest is paid on borrowings of past ( i.e. debt).

net primary deficit= net fiscal deficit – interests payments.

## revenue deficit
- [[revenue deficit]]
- it'll be equal to revenue expense- revenue receipts
- revenue deficit's how much borrowing govt'll be doing to perform its sovereign funcs.
- it's expected dt govt is at least able to spend on its own maintenance & existence fm wt it collects as a matter of rights(revenue receipts) & nt by borrowing money or by selling its assets.
- ∴ rev deficit's a measure to see how healthy govts' finances are with respect to performance of their basic duties.

## frbm act 2003 (fiscal responsibility & budget management act)
- it was a logical consequence of wma agreement [[1997]].
- due to wma govt’s (forceful) borrowings fm rbi being stopped & ∴ govt was now dependent on market to borrow.

- as a result, govt had to be disciplined in its borrowings be b/c market wd lend to govt at market costs (interest rates) & thus debt wd hv to be repaid by future govts, & thus future generations.

- frbm imposed a discipline on govt borrowing by laying down limits of fiscal deficit & revenue deficit only.
- fiscal deficit was sought to be brought down to 3% of gdp by next 5 years & revenue deficit was to be brought down to 0.
- [[2007]], india was largely on path to achieving these targets till [[2008]], however, after dt it went astray.
- [[2010]], new concept of effective revenue deficit (ERD) was introduced.

- erd = revenue deficit - grants to states fr creation of capital assets.
- #wo_de (these contradictory and illogical terms reminds me of the phrase somewhere - "*every profession is a conspiracy against the laity*")
- center’s [[expenditure]] to states is categorized as a revenue expense.
- states are sometimes bound & sometimes free to spend ds money.
- may times ds expenditure fm center to state is used by states to create capital assets.
- ∴ even though ds expense is accounted as revenue expense by center, its final use is to create capital assets by states i.e. its utility is like a capital expense but is accounted as a revenue expense.
- in [[2010]], frbm was amended & instead of eliminating revenue deficit, govt targeted to eliminate effective revenue deficit.
