[Kuno National Park](https://kunonationalpark.org/about/forest-and-vegetation)
It is in the Sheopur district of [[Madhya Pradesh]] in [[Central India]].
It is in news for the last few years due to the lion & Cheetah rehabilitation project.
The sanctuary has a vast richness and diversity of indigenous flora and fauna which represents a typical cross-section of the dry deciduous forest of Central India.

KunoPaIpur Wildlife Sanctuary is underway to become India's second home for the Asiatic lion.
It is to prevent decline, and possible extinction, in a single habitat due to natural disasters, epidemics, declines in prey, or retaliatory killings.
Kuno's habitats have been fine-tuned for these new entrants with abundant populations of herbivores like nilgai, chital, sambhar, and chinkara, who are the lions' natural prey.
Geographically, Kuno also features the same kind of semi-arid vegetation in Gir, as it is under the same biogeographic zone.
This should make the transition more seamless for the lions.
The introduction of lions at Kuno is happening 29 years after it was first proposed.
Kuno has one of the most unique combinations of forest and vegetation in the entire Madhya Pradesh and adjoining areas which can only be seen to be believed.
Kuno National Park's Forest area is mainly dominated by Kardhai, Salai, Khair trees among mostly mixed forests, this also helps it in having a variety of species of flora and fauna.
