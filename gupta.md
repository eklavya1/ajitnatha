## gupta administration
during gupta age, political hierarchies can be identified by titles adopted.
kings assumed titles such as maharajadhiraja, parama-bhattaraka & parameshvara.
they were also connected with gods through epithets such as parama-daivata (foremost worshipper of gods) & parama bhagavata (foremost worshipper of vasudeva krishna).
some historians have suggested that gupta kings claimed divine status. for ex, samudragupta is compared to purusha (supreme being) in allahabad inscription.
these assertions can be seen as reflections of attempt to claim divine status by king.
seals & inscriptions make a mention of official ranks & designations, whose precise meaning is often uncertain.
term "kumaramatya" occurs in six vaishali seals, which suggests that this title represented a high-ranking officer associated with office (adikarana) of his own.
designation "amatya" occurs on several bita seals, & "kumaramatya" seems to have been pre-eminent among amatyas & equivalent in status to princes of royal kumaramatyas were attached to king, crown prince, revenue department or a province.
one of vaishali seals refers to a kumaramatya who seems to have been in charge of maintenance of sacred coronation tank of lichchavis. individuals holding ranks of kumaramatya sometimes had additional designations as well, & such ranks were hereditary.
for ex, harisena, composer of allahabad prashasti (inscriptions of praise), was a kumaramatya, sandhivigrahika & mahadandanayaka, & was son of dhruvabhuti, a mahadandanayaka.
gupta king was assisted by a council of mantrins (ministers).
allahabad prashasti refers to assembly or council, presumably of ministers, which was k/a sabha.
various high-ranking functionaries included sandhivigrahika or mahasandhivigrahika (minister for peace & war), who seems to have been a high-ranking officer in charge of contact & correspondence with other states, including initiating wars & concluding alliances & treaties.
high-ranking officials were c/a dandanayakas, & mahadandanayakas were high-ranking judicial or military officers.
