World History Class 07

Class started (1:03 PM)

A brief review of the last class.

The sequence of World events (1:10 PM)

Industrial revolution 
industrial capitalism
Policy of lazzie faire 
Rise of communism and socialism
1917 - Birth of USSR
The rivalry of Communism and Capitalism
1929- Great Depression.
Increase in rivalry.
The popularity of Communism.
Rise of Fascism (Rise in Hitler 1933, Italy and China )
The pause of Rivalry.
Resumed after 1945-91 (Coldwar era)

Reasons for the victory of the Chinese Communist Party  (1921) (1:13 PM)

The support of the USSR in terms of arms, aid.
Communism is a pro-poor ideology.
Therefore CCP got more support from poor peasant masses.
Mao didn't wait and did land redistribution in favor of poor peasants in areas under its control.
Hence the support was high.
Because of guerilla warfare, CCP was more successful against the Japanese hence nationalistic support increased.
Also, it was more effective against a traditional army of KMT.

A century of Humilation for China  (1:22 PM)

Forceful opening of China by military humiliation.
Loss of territory in 1840, 1858, 1895, WW1, 1931, 1933, WW2.
Cultural colonialism by the export of Christianity
Internal troubles eg Taiping Rebellion.
The decline of Central authority due to war defeats.
Nationalism was brutally suppressed eg Boxer rebellion and China was made to pay the cost of the suppression.
Collapse of central authority led to a decade of lawlessness eg Warlord era (1916-28)'
There was the failure of democracy when the West didn't help.
While industrial powers fought over the resources of China while China could just watch. For Eg Russo-Japanese War they fought over Manchuria.

Japanese imperialism (1:30 PM)

External Context-Like China Japan followed a policy of seclusion.
In the 1850s a US naval fleet threatened Japan to open up its economy.
Japan voluntarily complied because Japan was a small country traditionally in awe of China which has been a strong regional power.
Japan witnessed the humiliation of China by European powers, therefore, wanted to escape China like fate i,e colonialism.
Therefore it didn't resist and now wanted to ape the west.
Internal Context - Polity 
There was the rule of military nobles/ aristocrats/ Samurais who controlled different regions of Japan.
Lack of Central political authority hence it was fragmented.
Monarchy existed but it was powerless.
Economy -Feudal economy i,e closed economy, largely agrarian economy and concentration of economic power in hands of minority elite nobles.
Culture- Lack of modern nationalism.

Meiji restoration (1868 ) (1:50 PM)

It meant the restoration of the status of the king and a series of changes that followed.
A group of military aristocrats defeated the rest of the military nobility and restored the political status of the king.
They set up a privy council i,e an advisory body, and started ruling in name of the king.
Therefore the real power lay in the privy council and they implemented a series of changes in Japan.
They sent experts to the west to learn from the west and implement the west like polity, military, economy, and culture in Japan.
They adopted Germany like Constitution which had a very strong executive and a weak parliament.
They set up a parliament/Diet but it was weak as -
Limited financial powers with the diet.
The right to vote is limited to only elite sections.
The executive didn't have any powers to appoint military chiefs /generals and the military was responsible to the king.
Therefore executive didn't have proper control military which gradually grew as an independent power in Japan ( eg 1931 military did a coup against civilian government leading to military fascism)
Meiji/king was to remain apolitical and he was projected as a representative of God.
Break at 2:08 PM to 2:21 PM
Japan sent experts to the West for learning and importing technology and machines.
The state took lead in the industrialization of Japan as a thriving capitalist sector was absent.
Therefore state established PSU and funding from industrialization also came from State.
Therefore unlike Britian, it was top-down industrialization.
State utilized profits from trade with the West in agricultural goods to invest in the industrial sector.
The state promoted the private sector by giving them subsidies and tax incentives and once the private sector grew strong the state privatized the PSU's.
Therefore Japan did IR post-1868 with a focus on heavy industry, transport sector, etc.
It also helped modernize its military post-1868.
Military- Japan began developing the West like a modern military.
Conscription I,e compulsory military service was introduced.
And youth was forced to join the military.
The culture of Samurais was ended and the modern military defeated those Samurais who revolted.
Culture- Reforms were brought into the education sector with a focus on extreme nationalism.
So, the youth of Japan is inspired to sacrifice for Japan and make Japan a great nation.
However, this had a negative impact as there was public support later for Japanese imperialism and for military fascism.
Focus on skill development of a focus on skilling to have efficient blue-collar workers for factories.
Focus on higher education to have skilled technicians and managers.
Focus on promoting the king as God-like so there exists a central figure who can stabilize Japan in times of chaos.
Promotion of west-like culture eg dressing sense, keeping hair short, etc.

Japanese imperialism (3:07 PM)

1895- 1st Sino Japanese war - Taiwan and Senkaku islands 
1904-05 - Russo- Japan war - Manchuria, Sakhalin island 
Korea independent:1895, protectorate:1905, Annexed :1905.

German Pacific islands
1931- Manchuria separated and puppet state Manchukuo

1937-1945 - full war on china.

US imperialism (2:34 PM)

Doctrine- one-liner statement.
Policy-for operationalizing doctrine
Actions- for operationalizing policy.
Monroe Doctrine (1823-1947)
Truman Doctrine (1947)
Not followed during WW1,1924-29, WW2.
Monroe Doctrine -Under this doctrine, the US decided that European powers should not interfere in the US backyard i,e central and South America, and the US would not interfere in European affairs and conflicts.
Therefore the US adopted a policy of isolation whereby it wanted to be isolated from political and military conflicts of Europe and the rest of the world and it didn't want European interference in its backyard.
 However, it wanted to interact with the rest of the world via trade.
Therefore stressed upon freedom of navigation of seas.
Therefore the US wanted economic benefits from its global engagements and to shield itself from the cost of military conflicts.
Reason - the US was geographically isolated as it was separated from the rest of the world by the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.
Therefore military conflicts in far-off areas would be expensive.
The US had a huge landmass therefore huge resources for its industrialization and a rapidly expanding population.
Therefore, a huge domestic market and hence little desire for colonies.
The US wanted to be the sole power in its backyard.
This was the reason for the late imperialism by the US.
Also, post-1783, the US was busy with territorial expansion, 1861-65 civil war, and then industrialization which began properly after 1865.
US imperialism began in the late 1890s.
Reasons -
As the US economy and military power grew notion of its backyard expanded and by the 1890s it claimed the Pacific as its backyard.
As its economy grew it now wanted a greater share of export markets.
It was militarily confident by the 1890s to establish its domination in its backyard.

1898 Spain vs US war (3:43 PM)

Post-1815- Spain lost Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Columbia.
In 1898- Spain has Cuba,Puerto Rico in Central America
Also the Philippines in the pacific and Hawaii.
Result- Cuba made a protectorate of the US
Puerto Rico was annexed
Hawaii and the Philippines were annexed.
However primary reason was strategy of ensuring domination of backyard in pacific and not raw materials and export market.
Now the US interfered militarily and in the economy in Central and South American nations to extract benefits for its companies and to ensure that pro-US governments are in power. eg in 1913 popularly elected leader in Mexico Madero was overthrown.

Panama Canal -1914(3:50 PM)

It is a very important development in US economic history as it led to strong economic connectivity between the western US and the eastern US and between North America and South America.
However, Panama was part of Columbia and there was a dispute between the US and Columbia on a treaty relating to the use of the Panama Canal.
The US-manufactured a revolt in Panama city and recognized the government formed by rebels and signed a much more favorable treaty on the Panama canal.
The US heavily dominated the economy of Cuba and regularly interfered militarily in name of maintaining law and order.

The topic for the next class- Is scramble for Africa.
