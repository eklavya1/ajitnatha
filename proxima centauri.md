- proxima centauri is a small, low-mass star located 4.2465 light-years (1.3020 pc) away from the sun in the southern constellation of centaurus. its latin name means the 'nearest [star] of centaurus'. it was discovered in 1915 by robert innes and is the nearest-known star to the sun. with a quiescent apparent magnitude 11.13, it is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. proxima centauri is a member of the alpha centauri star system, being identified as component alpha centauri c, and is 2.18° to the southwest of the alpha centauri ab pair. it is currently 12,950 au (0.2 ly) from ab, which it orbits with a period of about 550,000 years.

proxima centauri is a red dwarf star with a mass about 12.5% of the sun's mass (m☉), and average density about 33 times that of the sun. because of proxima centauri's proximity to earth, its angular diameter can be measured directly. its actual diameter is about one-seventh (14%) the diameter of the sun. although it has a very low average luminosity, proxima centauri is a flare star that randomly undergoes dramatic increases in brightness because of magnetic activity. the star's magnetic field is created by convection throughout the stellar body, and the resulting flare activity generates a total x-ray emission similar to that produced by the sun. the internal mixing of its fuel by convection through its core, and proxima's relatively low energy-production rate, mean that it will be a main-sequence star for another four trillion years.

proxima centauri has three known exoplanets: proxima centauri b, proxima centauri c, and proxima centauri d. proxima centauri b orbits the star at a distance of roughly 0.05 au (7.5 million km) with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 earth days. its estimated mass is at least 1.17 times that of earth. proxima b orbits within proxima centauri's habitable zone—the range where temperatures are right for liquid water to exist on its surface—but because proxima centauri is a red dwarf and a flare star, the planet's habitability is disputed. a candidate super-earth, proxima centauri c, orbits roughly 1.5 au (220 million km) away every 1,900 d (5.2 yr). a sub-earth, proxima centauri d, orbits roughly 0.029 au (4.3 million km) away every 5.1 days.
