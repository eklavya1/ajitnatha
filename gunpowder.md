- gunpowder, also commonly known as black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder, is the earliest known chemical explosive. it consists of a mixture of sulfur, carbon (in the form of charcoal) and potassium nitrate (saltpeter). the sulfur and carbon act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer. gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms, artillery, rocketry, and pyrotechnics, including use as a blasting agent for explosives in quarrying, mining, and road building.

gunpowder is classified as a low explosive because of its relatively slow decomposition rate and consequently low brisance. low explosives deflagrate (i.e., burn at subsonic speeds), whereas high explosives detonate producing a supersonic shockwave. ignition of gunpowder packed behind a projectile generates enough pressure to force the shot from the muzzle at high speed, but usually not enough force to rupture the gun barrel. it thus makes a good propellant, but is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications with its low-yield explosive power. nonetheless it was widely used to fill fused artillery shells (and used in mining and civil engineering projects) until the second half of the 19th century, when the first high explosives were put into use.

its use in weapons has declined due to smokeless powder replacing it, and it is no longer used for industrial purposes due to its relative inefficiency compared to newer alternatives such as dynamite and ammonium nitrate/fuel oil.
