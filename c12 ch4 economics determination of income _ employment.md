# consumption
- [[consumption]]
	- C= C bar + cY
		- where,
		- C = consumption expenditure by households
		- C bar - [[autonomous consumption]]
		- cY - [[induced consumption]]
## marginal propensity to consume
- [[marginal propensity to consume]]
	- mpc - delta C / delta Y = c
		- delta C - changes in consumption
		- delta Y - changes in income
	- maximum value of c can be 1
	- mpc liese b/w 0 - 1
# savings
- the part of the [[income]] that is not consumed
- S = Y - C ---------[eq1]
## marginal propensity to save
- [[marginal propensity to save]], mps = delta S / delta Y = s ------[eq2]
- [eq1] in [eq2]
	- as S = Y - C,
	- therefore
	- mps = delta S / delta Y = s, will be
	- = (delta y - delta c) / delta y = _1 - c_
	- ie s = 1-c
	- or
	_- s + c = 1_
# average propensity to consume
