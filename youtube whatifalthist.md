## geopolitics of space colonization part 2
.......i'm not being biased here, i'm actually describing anthropological principles.
colonial societies tend to become extreme forms of societies that created them, also preserving a more conservative time- capsule like state that's more representative of era they were in.
this is since colonial settlers hold tight onto their home culture as a way of maintaining their identities in an alien environment. also, without all home forces to mediate them, most extreme characteristics of home societies get accentuated.
for example, american, quebecois & australian identities are over top versions of societies that made them.
[[17th century]] england was known for being democratic, mercantile,obsessed with freedom, religiously fanatic & having a crusading foreign policy.....like america. breton who dispraportionately settled quebec are known for being insular, hardy, proud & obsessed with their heritage...like quebecois.
mid [[19th century]] britain was campaigning for fairness, rife with class tensions & believed in rugged masculinity. look at values australia holds dear todav.

historians sometimes speak of "price of peace being greater than cost of war". cost of war is immediately apparent. cost of peace is not. in a situation in which there is a disbalance of power & in which 1 side will gain immense benefits from crushing other weaker side, price of not waging war is immense. this is main reason peace has trouble lasting.
main purpose of war is to rewrite rules of international system in order that your side gains more benefits. sometimes this is direct, in which you annex land from your opponents & sometimes it's indirect, in which you rig financial or legal systems in order that your faction always indirectly accrues benefits.
