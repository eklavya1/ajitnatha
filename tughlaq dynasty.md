	- The period of Tughlaq dynasty in history has been marked as the time of elation and rediscovery for Islamic architectures. The walls were made up of sun-dried bricks. The huge outer walls had sloping, extended to the large area of the southern Delhi ridge. Semi-circular bastions with eyelets were present at regular intervals to look down at the enemies. Conical bastions at the corners, tapering at the quoins of the gateways and batter on external walls, which are customary features of this age, appear here emphatically. The construction is in rubble and plaster which seems to have been originally painted or glared-tiled on such prominent surfaces as frieze, cupolas and pinnacles.
