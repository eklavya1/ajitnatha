a brief overview of the previous class

discussion on the numbers of the mock test that an aspirant should attempt for the prelims and mains and approach needed for the same. 
the time needed to attempt the paper and analysis of the paper.
discussion on the doubts from the previous class lecture.
minimum export price (mep): it is the price below which an exporter is not allowed to export the commodity. mep is fixed by the government to arrest domestic price rise and augment domestic supply.

## money (1:33:00 pm)
- guarantees are given by the government to bring legitimacy.
- fractional reserve system: currency printed will be equal to the price of the gold. they will determine the people who have the piece of the paper will turn up for the gold on the same value.
- bill: if you give one dollar bill the treasury will give you one gram of the gold.
- the government will print the bonds and sell them to the people. thus the government now will have the money.
- a guarantee is useful as long as the government can enforce it.
- now the government can spend the money in the economy.

## bitcoin (1:45:00 pm)
- explain the concept with help of the computer game “temple run”.
- role of the central bank: it protects your currency so that someone else cannot counterfeit the same. it prevents the volatility of the value of the currency. it guarantees the value of money and maintains the acceptability of currency. thus it protects the guarantee.
- bitcoin system is a game with complex computer algorithms.
mining means generating new bitcoin. bitcoin algorithm will become difficult as time passes.
it is very secure.
- encryption: it is the method of hiding the original information in such a form that is not easily visible or decipherable.
bitcoin follows a very high degree of inscription.

## functions and demand for money (2:23:00 pm)
- money performs the function of the transaction.
- because of the transaction function of the money, it generates the demand for the money.
- it is supplied by the central bank to facilitate easy transactions by the people.
- - money has a speculative purpose.
- transaction demand of the money: the transaction function of money is the most essential function. money is by definition is a medium of exchange and therefore the primary role it performs is to facilitate the transaction. transaction demand of money refers to the money needed in the economy for transaction purposes.
- value of transaction = price level * volume of the transaction (quantity of goods).
- - value of the transaction = velocity of money * total value of money
- velocity (v) * money (m) = price level (p) * quantity (q)
- v * m = p * y (y is real gdp)
- m = 1/v * p * y
- m = k (p * y)
- the transaction demand for money in an economy, m can be written in the following form
- m = k.t. here t is the total value of (nominal) transactions in the economy over a unit period.
- money demanded transaction purposes is directly proportional to the value of the nominal gdp.
- p = m * v/y
- the amount of money in the economy is the sole cause of the price level in the economy as real gdp is predictable and stable.
- for the central banks world over, the monetary policy is determined with inflation in their mind.
- keynesians will oppose such interpretation as for them v (velocity) and y (real gdp) both change from season to season. the mode of the transaction determines the velocity and real gdp impacted by the recession and growth periods.
- to estimate the transaction demand for the money we look at the value of transactions in the economy.
- value of transactions = velocity of money * amount of money.
- also, the value of transaction = price level of goods * quantity of goods
- from equation 1 and 2
- m * v = p* q
- sometimes this is also written as m * v = p * y
- the value of transactions for all the goods in the economy which include both final and intermediate goods would be proportional to the value of transactions pertaining only to the value of final goods as well.
- therefore we can say that value of the transaction is directly proportional to the nominal gdp.
- value of transaction = k.py
- mv = k py
- m = (k/v) py
- from the above equations m = k.py
- where k is inversely proportional to the velocity. hence it can be seen that money for transaction purposes is directly proportional to the value of the nominal gdp.
- from the above equation, it can also be seen that p = m.v/y
- this equation is interpreted differently by the monetarist and keynesians economist.
- while monetarists emphasized that v is behavioural and therefore is constant and y that is real gdp is also constant or predictable, therefore the only thing that causes a change in prices is the level of the money supply.
- hence monetary policy is the tool to control inflation.
- keynesians contest that v and y both fluctuate. for example, velocity changes during the festive seasons due to the evolution of the payment methods, and similarly the level of real gdp also fluctuate during the period of high growth and recessions.
- they agree that m causes a change in p but disagree with the importance to m that monetarists attach.

## speculative demand (3:38:00 pm)
- speculative demand means you are placing some bets on the future.
- money in your bank account is not useful for transaction purposes.
- here there is [[opportunity cost]].
- liquid money has advantages of transaction demand.
- banks give the interest for the money kept in the bank account.
- out of m amount of money, t is required for the transaction. the remaining (m-t) will be left, out of (m-t), l amount of money is kept as the liquid money because of the speculation that it could be needed.
- the remaining amount (m-t-l) will be converted or kept in some form that will be protected from inflation and earn some interest. this liquid amount l is known as the speculative demand of the money.
- (m-t-l) is known as the asset. the asset is expected to protect the value of money invested and appreciate over a period of time. it can not be guaranteed but desirable.
- a common asset is a government that is representative of all types of assets. a government bond is simply a piece of paper.
- issuer, face value, [[interest rate]], time period, purpose are important components of the bond.
- if the government default on the guarantee on the bond means the central bank will also default and the acceptability of currency will decrease.

the topic for the next class discussion: government bonds and speculative demand of money.
