fibre-reinforced plastic (frp) (also k/a a fibre-reinforced polymer) is a composite material made of a polymer matrix reinforced with fibres. 
composites are established as altemative material system to traditional materials such as steel, wood, aluminium & concrete.

bakelite was first fibre-reinforced plastic.

materials used as fibres in frp composites
o glass, carbon, basalt or aramid & at times fibres such as paper, wood or asbestos are also used.

materials used as polymers in frp composites
o polymer used is usually epoxy, vinyl ester or polyester thermosetting plastic or phenol-formaldehyde resin.

manufacturing of frp composite material
frp involves 2 distinct processes, first is process whereby fibrous material is manufactured & formed, second is process whereby fibrous materials are bonded with matrix during moulding.
