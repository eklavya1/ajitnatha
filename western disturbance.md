western disturbance (wd) is extra-tropical storm that originates in mediterranean region. western cyclonic disturbances are weather phenomena of winter months, with low-pressure systems on upper atmosphere which form over mediterranean region & travel east across the globe.
they usually influence weather of north & north-western regions of india.
tropical cyclones occur during monsoon, as well as, in october â€” november, & are part of the easterly flow. these disturbances affect coastal regions of country.
north-westem plains of india experience winter rainfall due to invasion of westem disturbances rising from mediterranean sea, steered by westerly 
 jetstream.
as westem disturbances are associated with cyclonic winds, they bring rainfall.
western disturbances, specifically ones in winter, bring moderate to heavy rain in low-lying areas and heavy snow to mountainous areas of indian subcontinent.
they are cause of most winter & pre-monsoon season rainfall across northwest india.
when these low-pressure systems, western disturbances, come into indian subcontinent they get blocked by himalayas & precipitate rain in northwestern plains & as snow in higher altitudes of western himalayas.
after precipitating over northwest india they weaken & are devoid of moisture they blow as dry winds creating dense fog over northern plains of india.
although total amount of winter rainfall locally k/a 'mahawat' is small, they are of immense importance for cultivation of 'rabi' crops.
