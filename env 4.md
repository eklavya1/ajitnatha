# ******************************

# Water cycle
(1.17 PM)
- or hydrological cycle
- [[water]] is cycled in three forms ice, water(l), and water vapor.
- [[ocean]]s contain more than about 70% of water.
- The remaining water is found in polar ice, mountain glaciers, surface waters, groundwater.
- The important processes in the water cycle are evaporation, cloud formation, condensation, precipitation.
- Respiration: C6H12O6+6O2 =6CO2+6H2O. 
- Transpiration: loss of excess water as water vapor from the stomata of plants.

# Oxygen cycle
(1.25 PM)
- It is linked to the carbon cycle.
- Photosystthis releases oxygen which is used up in respiration.
- Formation of [[stratosphere]]ric [[ozone]] in the [[atmosphere]](25-30 km): [[oxygen]] breaks in the presence of UV rays to give ozone.
- Oxygen is found in minerals such as sulfate, phosphate, etc.
- Oxygen is found in the ores like hematite, [[bauxite]], silica, calcite, etc, found in the earth's crust.
# sedimentary cycle
## Phosphorus cycle
(1.33 PM)
- It is an [[important]] element for living organisms.
- It is found in the bones and teeth of [[animal]].
- It is also found in nucleic acids like DNA and RNA.
- Unlike the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle atmospheric component is lacking in the phosphorus cycle.
	- ie it is only a land-sea cycle
- The reserve pool of the phosphorus cycle in the [[earth]]'s [[crust]].
- Phosphorus from the rocks becomes part of [[soil]] through [[weathering]].
- From the soil, it is taken up by the plants which convert it into organic matter.
- The plants are then eaten by the animals.
- When the animal dies the bacteria decomposes the animals to release phosphorus back, which leads to the creation of rocks.
- The tectonic upliftment brings the rocks back on the surface and thus the cycle continues.
- The use of chemical fertilizers such as ammonium phosphate in agriculture adds phosphorus to the soil.
- Phosphate found in the [[soil]] through agricultural run-off reaches the oceans and marine bodies.
- This is taken up by marine organisms. 
- Then the death of the marine organic leads to sedimentation which further leads to mineralization.
- Then it enters into the earth's crusts thus carrying the cycle forward.
- Guano deposits (bird dropping) contain phosphorus. guano deposits are found in Ecuador in [[south ç¾Žå›½ tk]]. _related_ [[coprolite]]

## Sulfur cycle
(2.00 PM)

Sulfur is found in living organisms in the form of proteins(cysteine amino-acid).
Enzymes also contain sulfur.
Sulfur is found in rocks like ores(Pyrite ores, etc).
through weathering, sulfur enters the soil.
This sulfur is absorbed by the plants.
these plants are eaten by animals.
Then animal dies and the Sulfur breaking bacteria release the Sulfur back to the soil.
The sulfur is also released by the bacterial action into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide gas.
Through mineralization, the sulfur again becomes part of the rocks and the cycle continues.
Natural sources of sulfur: 
Volcanic eruption, hot geysers, sulfur springs, thermal vents, etc.
Anthropogenic sources:  
Release of SO2 by thermal power plants.
Use of hydrocarbons in vehicles, smelting, refinery, etc.
Burning of the fuelwood for cooking.
The SO2 and H2S gas reacts with rainwater and cause acid rain.
The sulfur in the soil reaches marine organisms through agricultural runoffs.
This sulfur is taken up by marine organisms and becomes part of the marine food web.
When these marine organisms die, they are deposited on the bottom of the ocean as sediments.
Then through mineralization sulfur enters the earth's crust.
The process of rock formation follows and these rocks are brought back to the surface, continuing the cycle again.

# Biological diversity
(2.28 PM)

It is the scientific study of variation found in all living organisms in all forms & complexities.
It is also a study of all the differences found within species, between species, and between ecosystems.
Type of bio-diversity:
Genetic diversity:
It is studied at the genetic level within species based on differences found in genes and DNA.
For example:
Leopard: Common leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard. 
Tiger: Royal Bengal tiger, Amur tiger(Siberia), Javan tiger, African tiger, Caspian tiger.
Lion: African lion(Savana grasslands), Asiatic lions(Gir).
Mango: alfanso, malda, langda, banganpalli etc. 
Species diversity:
Differences are found between various types of species.
For example Tiger, Lion, Leopard, etc.

# Ecosystem/community diversity:
It is the different types of species composition found between various types of ecological systems.
For example:
Tropical rainforest(amazon rainforest, western ghats) versus alpine forest.
Thar desert versus Sahara desert.

# Importance of biodiversity
(2.52 PM)

Biodiversity values:
Food, medicines, timber, etc.
Ecological values: Food web, Nutrient cycling, etc.
Aesthetic and recreational values: literature and eco-tourism.
Spiritual, Religious, cultural, and traditional values like beliefs, faiths, etc.
Knowledge values: the scientific knowledge we drive from nature.
Ethical value: to protect the environment for example Chipko movement.
Ecosystem services:
Provisional services: food, water, forest produce, oxygen, etc.
Regulating services: cycling of wastes, climate moderation, control of flood, etc.
Supporting services: providing habitat to living organisms, nutrient cycle, etc.
Cultural services: festivals like Bihu, Pongal, Onam, etc.
These ecosystem services are based on the finding of the millennium ecosystem assessment(MEB) report.

# The economics of ecosystem and biodiversity(TEEB)
(3.27 PM)

TEEB concept was brought up by Pawan Sukhdev in 2007.
The aim of TEEB is the monetary valuation of ecosystem service and biodiversity values in terms of "green domestic product"(natural capital).
It is a quantitative tool to capture, evaluate and demonstrate ecosystem services and biodiversity values in monetary terms for decision making.
It is also a method of green accounting. 
TEEB was initiated by G-8, in developing countries like India, China, South Africa, Brazil, etc in Potsdam in 2008.
It is hosted by UNEP.

# Biodiversity loss
(3.44 PM)

Habitat loss:
Mining, deforestation, infrastructure projects, etc.
Invasive alien species: introduced in agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, by humans or other species that migrate naturally.
Climate change: 
Polar bears(melting of arctic ice).
Croal reef belching(great barrier reef).
Effect on the migratory species.
Envirmonertal pollution:
Acid rain affecting the forest ecosystem and water bodies.
River pollution affecting dolphins etc.
Genetic pollution:
Uncontrolled hybridization(interbreeding and cross-breeding).
GM varieties of crops for example BT- cotton.
Over-exploitation of the genetic resources:
Illegal hunting and poaching of wildlife and the killing of animals etc.

# Biodiversity conservation
(4.04 PM)

In-situ conservation:
It is the conservation within the natural habitat of wild animals and plants.
For example various types of sanctuaries, various types of national parks, biosphere reserves, community reserves, conservation reserves, protected forests, reserved forests.
Ex-situ conservation:
It is the conservation of species outside the natural habitat.
Conservation of plants: herbarium, botanical gardens, seed banks(cryo-preservation) like Svalbard in Norway and Changla bank in Ladakh.
Conservation of animals: captive breeding center, zoological park, DNA banks(LACONS in Hyderabad, IVRI lab in Bareilly).

The topic for the next class: national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.
