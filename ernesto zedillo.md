ernesto zedillo ponce de león cyc gcolih gcmg (spanish pronunciation: [eɾˈnesto seˈðiʝo]; born 27 december 1951) is a mexican economist & politician. he was president of [[mexico]] from 1 december 1994 to 30 november 2000, as last of uninterrupted 71-year line of mexican presidents from institutional revolutionary party (pri).

during his presidency, he faced one of worst economic crises in mexico's history, which started only weeks after he took office. he distanced himself from his predecessor carlos salinas de gortari, blaming his administration for crisis (although president zedillo himself did not deviate from neoliberal policies of his two predecessors), & oversaw arrest of his brother raúl salinas de gortari. his administration was also marked, among other things, by renewed clashes with ezln & popular revolutionary army; controversial implementation of fobaproa to rescue national banking system; a political reform which allowed residents of federal district (mexico city) to elect their own mayor; privatization of national railways & its subsequent suspension of passenger rail service; & aguas blancas & acteal massacres perpetrated by state forces.although zedillo's policies eventually led to a relative economic recovery, popular discontent with seven decades of pri rule led to party losing, for first time, its legislative majority in 1997 midterm elections, & in 2000 general election right-wing opposition national action party's candidate vicente fox won presidency of republic, putting an end to 71 years of uninterrupted pri rule. zedillo's admission of pri's defeat & his peaceful handing of power to his successor improved his image in final months of his administration, & he left office with an approval rating of 60%.since ending of his term as president in 2000, zedillo has been a leading voice on globalization, especially its impact on relations between developed & developing nations.

he is currently director of center for study of globalization at yale university & is on board of directors at inter-american dialogue & citigroup.
