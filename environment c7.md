# Megadiversities
(1:18 PM)

- The concept was given for the first time in [[1988]], by _World Conservation Monitoring Center_ (WCMC).
- WCMC is a specialized agency working under the [[UNEP]] United Nations Environment Programme.
- A Megadiverse country is a country with a high richness of species satisfying two criteria
	Criterion 1: The country _must have_ 5000 [[endemic]] plants. (India has about 95,000 types of plants) 
	Criterion 2: The country should have a coastal/marine ecosystem within its borders, or surrounded by sea or ocean. (It _should not be a landlocked country_).
- Both criteria need to be classified together to be called as a megadiverse country. 
- There are 17 Megadiverse Countries worldwide. (India is also one of the 17 megadiverse countries).
- 17 Megadiverse Countries
	- Australia,
	- Brazil,
	- China,
	- Colombia,
	- Ecuador,
	- [[united states of america]],
	- Philippines,
	- India,
	- Indonesia,
	- Madagascar,
	- Malaysia,
	- Mexico,
	- Papua New Guinea,
	- Peru,
	- Democratic Republic of Congo,
	- South Africa, and
	- Venezuela.

# Hope spots
(Example)

In 2013 the Andaman Islands and Lakshadweep islands were named as the new "hope spots" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Mission Blue. 
Nicobar is not a part of Hopespot.

# Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries (LMMC)
(1:54 PM)

- Group of countries which are rich in biodiversity, together with traditional knowledge.
- LMMC was formed in 2002 during Cancun Summit, held in Mexico (during Convention on Biodiversity). 
- Formed with following aims and objectives: 
	- To cooperate with each other for the conservation of biodiversity.
	- This group of countries will encourage other countries to join important biodiversity conventions and protocols such as: CBD, Nagoya Protocol, Cartagena Protocol.
	- There are 18 countries in this group, including India. Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Venezuela.

# Biodiversity Conventions
(2:15 PM)
#imp 
## Convention on Biodiversity
Adopted in [[1992]] under (Agenda 21 is a document of sustainable development based on the 21st Century).
CBD was adopted during Rio Conference. 
3 main objectives of CBD: 
	Conservation of [[biodiversity]].
	Sustainable use of Genetic resources arising from biodiversity.
	Fair and equitable benefit-sharing arising from market use of genetic resources. 
	CBD has two protocols (legally binding agreement).

## Cartagena Protocol
Adopted in 2001 and ratified in [[2003]].
Bio-safety guidelines with respect to the use, certification, labeling, packaging, transport, transboundary movement of living modified organisms.

## Nagoya Protocol
(2:38 PM)
It deals with fair and equitable benefit sharing.
Creates guidelines to provide rights to local communities who are custodians of â€˜know-howâ€™, to access genetic resources and right to get benefits from the market use, from the commercial use of such resources.

# Aichi Biodiversity Targets
(2:45 PM)

20 Biodiversity Targets under 5 strategic Goals, were adopted during Nagoya Summit in Japan in 2010. 
These 20 targets to be fulfilled by member parties of the CBD from [[2011]] to [[2020]] (10 years).
Target 1: By 2020, at the latest, people are aware of the values of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use it sustainably.
Target 2: By 2020, at the latest, biodiversity values have been integrated into national and local development, etc.
Target 3: By 2020, at the latest, incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity are eliminated, phased out, etc.
Target 4: By 2020, at the latest, Governments, businesses, and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve sustainable production and consumption within safe ecological limits.
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all-natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero.
Target 6: By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem-based approaches, etc.
Target 7: By 2020 areas under agriculture, aquaculture and forestry are managed sustainably, ensuring conservation of biodiversity.
Target 8: By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified, controlled.
Target 10: By 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs, and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted by climate change or ocean acidification are minimized.
Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved.
Target 12: By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented.
Target 13: By 2020, the genetic diversity of cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and of wild relatives, including other socio-economically as well as culturally valuable species, is maintained.
Target 14: By 2020, ecosystems that provide essential services, including services related to water, and contribute to health, livelihoods, and well-being, are restored and safeguarded.
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced.
Target 16: By 2015, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization is in force and operational.
Target 17: By 2015 each Party has developed, adopted as a policy instrument, and has commenced implementing an effective, participatory, and updated national biodiversity strategy and action plan.
Target 18: By 2020, the traditional knowledge, innovations, and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity fully integrated.
Target 19: By 2020, knowledge, the science base, and technologies relating to biodiversity are, shared and transferred, and applied.
Target 20: By 2020, at the latest, the mobilization of financial resources for effectively implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020.

# Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)

Adopted in the year 1973.
During a conference organized by UNEP, on the subject matter of â€˜illegal tradeâ€™ of wild animals/plants. 
This convention was held in Washington DC. Hence it is also called as â€˜Washingtonâ€™ Convention. 
Although CITES is a legally binding convention, but it does not ask a member party of government to bring separate legislation or separate law on the subject matter at the national level. 
Objectives of CITES: To regulate the international trade of specimens/samples/parts of wild animals and plants, so that they are not threatened to extinction. 
It has 3 Appendix: 
Appendix 1: List of species for which trade is prohibited. Unless the government permits. E.g. Tiger/Elephant, etc.
Appendix 2: It contains the list of species for which trade is controlled by the governments. E.g. Red Sanders (Tree species, Andhra Pradesh). 
Appendix 3: It has a list of species protected by one member party (one government), which requests other member parties to protect/control the trade of such species. (E.g. Tiger, in India it is protected by Schedule 1 of Indian laws, but also it is under CITES Appendix 3, which other nations need to protect). 

# Convention on Migratory Species (CMS)

Adopted in 1979 by the UNEP during a Conference held in Bonn, Germany (Also known as Bonn Convention).
Objectives: To Conserve and manage migratory species (avian, marine, terrestrial animals) and their habitats in range countries. 
Two Appendix: 
Appendix I: List of Migratory Species which are highly threatened with extinction.
Appendix II: List of Migratory Species which are at present not threatened with extinction but can benefit from conservation. 

# UNESCO World Heritage Convention (1972)

Either it will be of cultural importance or natural significance. 
Or it can be both. 

In India, Natural World Heritage Sites are:
