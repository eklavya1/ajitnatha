	- the question that arose in front of the [[supreme court]] was whether the basic structured test would involve the [[judicial review]] of 9th schedule laws on the touchstone of [[fundamental rights]]. in this case the court tried to bring clarity on the judgement of [[waman rao case vs uoi 1980]]
	- court said
		- no [[blanket immunity]] would be provided to laws placed in schedule 9 after 24th April 1973
		- any laws placed in  schedule 9 after the particular date can be judicially reviewed on the [[touchstone]] of [[a14 eq 前 法]] & [[protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech etc]] this power of [[judicial review]] over any law placed in schedule 9 comes from judicial review being a part of the basic structure of the constitution
