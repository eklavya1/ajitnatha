[[2022-03-17]] 18:55 reminds me of [[CCW]]
The Rotterdam Convention (formally, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in Intemational Trade) signed in [[1998]] is a multilateral treaty to promote shared responsibilities in relation to the importation of hazardous chemicals, effective from [[2004]].
The convention promotes an open exchange of information and calls on exporters of hazardous chemicals to use proper labeling, includes directions on safe handling, and informs purchasers of any known restrictions or bans.
