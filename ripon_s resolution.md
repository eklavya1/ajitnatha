- The Government of Ripon desired the provincial governments to apply in case of local bodies the same principle of financial decentralization which Lord Mayo's Government had begun towards them.
- The main points of the resolution were as follows:
- Development of local bodies advocated to improve the administration and as an instrument of political and popular education; Policy of administrating local affairs through urban and rural local bodies charged with definite duties and entrusted with suitable sources of revenues
- Non-officials to be in majority in these bodies, who could be elected if the officials thought that it was possible to introduce elections
- Non-officials to act as chairpersons to these bodies
- Official interference to be reduced to the minimum and to be exercised to revise and check the acts of local bodies, but not to dictate policies
- Official executive sanction is required in certain cases, such as raising of loans, alienation of municipal property, imposition of new taxes, undertaking works costing more than a prescribed sum, framing rules, by-laws, etc.
- In pursuance of this resolution, many Acts were passed between 1883 and 1885 which greatly altered the constitution, powers, and functions of municipal bodies in India.
- But, an era of effective local self-governing bodies was still a dream unfulfilled.
