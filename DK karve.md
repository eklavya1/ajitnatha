The limited enforcement and practicability of legislations like the widow remarriage act of 1856 and others in a tradition-bound society were recognized by D. K. Karve, who, therefore, concentrated his efforts on promoting education among widows.
In [[1896]] Karve along with 15 of his colleagues founded the Ananth Balikashram for the education of widows, where the courses were drawn up with an idea to make the
widows self-reliant.
He also started Mahila Vidyalaya in 1907 and S.N. D. T. Women's University in 1916 a separate educational institution for women to lessen the resistance of the orthodox 
section about women's education.
The social reform movement in its later phases resulted in producing women social reformers who worked for their cause.
Pandita Ramabai started Sharda Sadan in Bombay in 1889 to provide an ashram to destitute high caste widows. In 1912-1913 a widow's home was established by sister Subbulakshmi, another widow in Madras.
