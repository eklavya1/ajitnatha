There are four types of political parties in the modern democratic states, viz.
1. Reactionary parties want to restore the old socio-economic and political institutions.
2. Conservative parties believe in the status quo.
3. Liberal parties aim at reforming the existing institutions.
4. Radical parties aim at establishing a new order by overthrowing the existing institutions.
In their classification of political parties based on ideologies, the political scientists have placed the radical parties on the left and the liberal parties in the center, and reactionary and conservative parties on the right. In other words, they are described as the leftist parties, centrist parties, and rightist parties.
In India, the CPI and CPM are examples of leftist parties, the Congress of centrist parties, and the BJP is an example of rightist parties.

**A registered party is recognized as a National Party only if it fulfills any one of the following three conditions -**
	The party wins 2% of the seats in the Lok Sabha (as of 2014, 11 seats) from at least 3 different States; or
	At a General Election to Lok Sabha or Legislative Assembly, the party polls 6% of votes in four States and in addition, it wins 4 Lok Sabha seats from any state or states; or
	A party gets recognition as State Party in four or more States.
Parties recognized as such are given unique symbols which only the official candidates of that party can use.
The parties that get these privileges and some other special facilities are recognized by the Election Commission of India for this purpose.
That is why these parties are called recognized parties.
As recognized by the Election Commission of India as in March 2014.
