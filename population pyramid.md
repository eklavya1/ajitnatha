a population pyramid is a graphical representation of age & sex composition of a specific [[population]].
it consists of two histograms, one for each gender (by convention, men on left & women on right) where numbers are shown horizontally & ages vertically.
numbers by gender & by age depend on interactions between fertility, mortality, & migrations.
## early expansion stage
here base of pyramid is large, but height improves because of a decrease in death rate denoting expanding population.
in europe, early expanding stage started with industrial revolution with better food production & decreasing famines.
thus, birth rate continued to increase & mortality rate decreased which improved high of population pyramid.
## bell-shaped pyramid
it corresponds to late expanding stage of demographic transition theory where death rate decreases further & almost bottomed out & birth rate also falls because of social development (education, way of life, small families)
in bell-shaped pyramid, there is a bulge in middle age group.
a large number of adolescents enter workforce.
in general, youth bulges in developing nations are associated with higher unemployment.

slow birth & death rates lead to a near stable population.
