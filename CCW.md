	This year, for the first time, a majority of the 125 nations that belong to an agreement called the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons said they wanted curbs on killer robots.
But they were opposed by members that are developing these weapons, most notably the United States and Russia.
Killer robots mean drones, guns and bombs that decide on their own, with artificial brains, whether to attack and kill.

The United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW or CCWC), concluded in Geneva on October 10, 1980, and entered into force in December [[1983]].
It seeks to prohibit or restrict the use of certain conventional weapons which are considered excessively injurious or whose effects are indiscriminate.
The full title is Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.
The convention covers land mines, booby traps, incendiary devices, blinding laser weapons and clearance of explosive remnants of war.
