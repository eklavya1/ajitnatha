- [[india]] was part of [[gondwana]] land after splitting of [[pangaea]]
- india got separated from gondwana land & started to move towards [[eurasia]]n plate around `140 mya`
- initially condition was [[ocean]] continent convergence during which oceanic plate below [[tethys sea]] was `subducting` below continental plate of [[eurasia]] resulting in formation of mountains of [[china]] & [[tibet]]an plateau. gradually tethys sea was contracting.

- when entire oceanic plate was completely subducted `continental-continental collission` b/w indian & [[eurasia]]n plates started 12:38 am 18/8/2021
- very high compression due to continental-continental collission resulted in sediments of [[tethys sea]] to be squeezed, crushed & formation of a series of [[fold]]s c/a as [[himalaya]]

# summary	


last class revision

    soil.

brief mapping of india.

    there are 28 states & 8 union territories.
    neighbors of india: 
    pakistan.
    china.
    bangladesh.
    myanmar
    bhutan
    afghanistan
    maritime boundary:
    sri lanka.
    maldives.

indian physiography

    indian physiography is divided into 4 parts:
    mountains.
    plateaus.
    plains.
    islands.

mountains

    himalayas:
    origin of himalayas:
    india was part of gondwana land after splitting of pangea.
    indian plate got separated from gondwana land & started to move towards eurasian plate around 140 million years ago.
    initially, condition was ocean-continent convergence during which oceanic plate below tethys sea was subducting below continental plate of eurasia resulting in formation of mountains of china & tibetian plateau.
    gradually tethys sea was contracting.
    while indian plate was passing over reunion hot spot, magma eruption resulted in formation of deccan traps.
    when entire oceanic plate was completely subducted, continental-continental collision b/w indian & eurasian plates started.
    very high compression due to continent-continent collision resulted in sediments of tethys sea being squeezed, crust, & formation of a series of folds c/a himalayas.
    himalayas were formed in 3 diff phases:
    1st phase(12-70 million years ago):  1st phase of compression created great himalayas.
    2nd phase(30-25 million years ago): 2nd phase of compression created middle himalayas.
    3rd phase(25-2 million years ago): 3rd phase of compression created shivalik.
    syntaxial bend of himalaya:
    westernmost point (nanga parbat) to easternmost point (namcha barwa).
    reason for bend: it's due to maximum push offered at both end of indian peninsula during its northward drift.
    in northwest it's due to aravalis in northeast it's due to assam ranges. both acted as 2 extended arms while central area sagged due to presence of tibetan plateau giving arcuate shape.  
    evidence that himalayas are still growing:
    frequent earthquakes are being experienced in himalayas.
    rivers of himalayas: youthful rivers of himalayas with high energy & high erosional capacity.
    recent adjustment in height of himalayas.
    desiccation of lakes in tibet.

various ranges in himalayas

    trans-himalayas:
    these are mountains which are formed before formation of great himalayas.
    exs are karakoram range, ladakh range, zanskar range.
    great himalayas:
    they are also c/a himadri mountains.
    they have average height is 6000 meters.
    lesser/ middle himalayas:
    they are also c/a as himachal mountains.
    they are discontinuous ranges with average height of 4000 meters. 
    exs are pir panjal range, dhauladhar range, nag tibba range, mahabharat range. 
    shivaliks:
    they are also c/a outer himalayas.
    they are not very tall with average height of 1000-1500 meters.
    in arunachal pradesh, they merge with lesser himalayas. exs are dafla, miri, abhor, mishmi hills.
    purvanchal hills:
    they are hills of northeast india.
    exs: mizo hills, naga hills, barail range khasi, mikir hills, etc.
    they are technically not part of himalayas.
    here compression is not as strong as in himalayas.
    regional division of himalayas:
    punjab himalayas: b/w indus river & sutlej river.
    kumaon himalayas: b/w sutlej river & kali river.
    nepal himalayas: b/w kali river & teesta river.
    assam himalayas: b/w teesta river & brahmaputra river.
    differences b/w western himalayas & eastern himalayas:
    western himalayas are taller than eastern himalayas.
    western himalayas are wider than eastern himalayas which are narrow due to difference in compression.
    western himalayas rises gradually while eastern himalayas raises abruptly.
    western himalayas are located at higher latitudes while eastern himalayas are located at lower latitudes.
    western himalayas have a lower snow line while eastern himalayas has a higher snow line.
    western himalayas receive less precipitation while eastern himalayas receive high precipitation.
    western himalayas has coniferous vegetation while eastern himalayas have evergreen & deciduous forest.
    western himalayas has less biodiversity while eastern himalayas have more biodiversity.
    faults zones/ fracture zones 
    indo-tsangpo fracture zone: b/w tibetain region & greater himalayas.
    main central thrust: b/w great himalayas & middle himalayas.
    main boundary thrust: b/w middle himalayas & shivaliks.
    main frontal thrust: b/w shivaliks & ganga plains.

peninsular plateau

    peninsular plateau is made up of a great composition of ancient rock which has remained stable & as a single rigid block of mass for every period of time.
    however, peninsular block has been subjected to foll tectonic disturbances:
    submergence of western part of peninsular plateau resulting in a very wide continental shelf.
    formation of rift valleys such as narmada, tapi, etc.
    formation of deccan traps due to eruption of basaltic magma.
    there are many hills & plateaus of peninsular block:
    
   important hills:
    
    aravalis: they are 1 of oldest mountains in world.
    vindhya & satpura are block mountains formed due to faulting. 
    western ghats & eastern ghats:
    ghats mean high elevated region.
    they are not folded mountains & not totally block. they may have been formed by some upliftment & subsidence.
    
   important plateaus:
    
    deccan plateau: b/w triangular region of western ghats, eastern ghats, & narmada& tapi system.
    meghalaya plateau: was part of peninsular region but got separated due to ganga & brahmaputra rivers.
    chota nagpur plateau: it's very rich in minerals.
    difference b/w western ghats & eastern ghats.
    western ghats are from tapi to kanyakumari whereas eastern ghats are from orissa to nilgiri.
    western ghats are a bit taller while eastern ghats are not as taller as western ghats.
    western ghats are continuous whereas eastern ghats are discontinuous. due to major rivers flowing toward east.
    compared to western ghats eastern ghats are very wide.
    western ghast receives very high precipitation as compared to eastern ghats.
    western ghats have high biodiversity & eastern ghats have low biodiversity.
    western ghats are taller near south(highest point anaimudi peak) whereas eastern ghats are taller near northern part(highest peak mahendragiri).
    hills of western ghats includes:
    sahyadri: maharashtra & karnataka.
    nilgiri: at trijunction tamil nadu. karnataka & kerala.
    animalia: kerala.
    cardamon: kerala.
    eastern ghats hills: palakonda, javadi, shevaroy, nallamala, etc.
