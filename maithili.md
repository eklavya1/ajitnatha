maithils (tirhuta: মৈথিল, devanagari: मैथिल), also known as maithili people, are an indo-aryan ethno-linguistic group from the indian subcontinent, who speak the maithili language as their native language. they inhabit the mithila region, which comprises tirhut, darbhanga, kosi, purnia, munger, bhagalpur and santhal pargana divisions of india and some adjoining districts of nepal.

the maithil region forms an important part of hinduism as it is said to be the birthplace of sita, the wife of ram and incarnation of lakshmi.
