- sarai (also transcribed as saraj or saray, from [[persian]] sarāy, "palace" or "court") was the name of possibly two cities near the lower volga, that served successively as the effective capitals of the golden horde, a turco-mongol kingdom which ruled much of northwestern asia and eastern europe, in the 13th and 14th centuries. there is considerable disagreement among scholars about the correspondence between specific archaeological sites and the various references to sarāy, sarāy-i bātū ("the sarai of batu"), sarāy-i barka ("the sarai of berke"), sarāy al-jadīd ("new sarai"), and sarāy al-maḥrūsah ("sarai blessed [by god]") in the historical sources.
