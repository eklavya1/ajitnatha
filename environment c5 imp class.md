# Biodiversity conservation
(1.03 PM)
## Habitat protection approach:
In-situ conservation: national park, wildlife sanctuaries.
Ex-situ conservation: breeding centers, botanical parks, seed banks, zoological parks, gene banks, etc.
## Species protection approach:
- [[iucn]] red data book: threatened species.
- Conventions: CITES, CMS,CBD.
- Wildlife protection act [[1972]] (schedule 1-5 for animals & 6 for plants).
- How to know where to carry out conservation & where to notify these protected areas?
- This is done by mapping area.
- Assessment of habitats to understand [[species]] composition.
- Then comes declaration of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.
# Biodiversity Mapping
(1.23 PM)
- There are two parameters used to measure biodiversity namely:
	- Species richness: _related_ [[gdp]] | [[production]]
		- It is type or variety of species found in habitat.
		- It is measurement of number of different types of species found in a habitat.
	- Species evenness: _related_ [[gini coefficient]] | [[kuznets curve]]
		- It is distribution of each species in habitat.
		- It is measurement of uniform or non-uniform distribution of all species found in a habitat.

- For example-1:
Species        habitat-1             habitat-2
Tiger             25                        5.
Deer             24                        30.
Elephant       25                       10.
Leopard        26                       55.
Species richness: habitat-1=4 species, habitat-2=4 species, thus same for both habitats.
Species evenness: evenness is more in habitat-1 than habitat-2, as number of each species is more evenly distributed in habitat-1.

For example-2:
Species        habitat-1             habitat-2
Tiger             95                        0.
Leopard        105                      55.
Asiatic lion   100                      55.
Gaur             0                          90.
Chital           0                          35.
Sambar        100                      75.
Total             400                      310.

- Species richness is more in habitat-2 as habitat-1 has 4 species while habitat-2 has 5 species.
- Species evenness is more in habitat-1 than in habitat-2, as habitat-1 has a more uniform distribution.
- Alpha diversity: 
- It is a diversity of species within a habitat.
- Beta diversity:
- It is a diversity of species b/w habitats.
- Gama diversity:
- It is total diversity of all habitats within a geographical area.  
 
For Example-3:
In Sunderbans delta:
Habitat-1:
Tiger & deer.
Alpha-1=2
Habitat-2:
Tiger, deer, crocodile, turtle.
Alpha-2=4.
Habitat-3:
Leopard,man,turtle.
Alpha-3=3.
Habitat-4:
Leopard, deer, crocodile, dolphins, hyena.
Alpha-4=5.
Thus, species richness Aplha-4>Aplha-2>Aplha-3>Aplha-1.
For beta diversity:

Beta-1&2=4.
Beta-2&3=6.
Beta-3&4=7.
Beta-1&4=6.
Beta-1&3=5.
Beta-2&4=7

Thus order of beta diversity: Beta-2&4=Beta-3&4>Beta-1&4=Beta-2&3>Beta-1&3>Beta-1&2.
Gamma diversity is 8 & will include all species. 

# Protected areas network in India
(2.38 PM)

## Wildlife Sanctuary:
- It is a protected area under wildlife protection act, [[1972]]. #pre 
- It is of adequate ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural, or zoological significance.

- It is notified by both state & central government.
- It is declared to protect, propagate, developing wildlife or its [[_environment moc]], for example, Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, etc.
- Certain rights of people living inside sanctuary could be permitted.
- Further, dur settlement of claims, before finally notifying sanctuary, district collector may, in consultation with chief wildlife warden allow continuation of any right of any person or community in or over any land within limits of sanctuary.
- Limited biotic interference is allowed.
- No distinction of core & buffer area.
- Tourism is allowed.
## National parks
- It is a protected area under wildlife protection act [[1972]].
- It is of adequate ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural, or zoological significance.

- It is declared for purpose, propagating, developing wildlife or its environment like that of sanctuary.
- difference b/w a sanctuary & national parks mainly lies in vesting of rights of people living inside.
- _Unlike a sanctuary where certain rights can be allowed, in a national park, no rights are allowed._
- No grazing of any livestock shall be permitted in a national park, will in a sanctuary, chief wildlife warden may regulate, control or prohibit it.
- It is notified by both state & central [[government]].
### It is divided into 2 areas:
- Core areas: no human interference allowed.
- Buffer areas: controlled human activities are allowed.
- Tourism is allowed but is controlled.
## Biosphere reserves:
- [[biosphere]] reserves are not specifically defined by any parliamentary law but derived from [[UNESCO]] Man & biosphere program, [[1971]].
- It is notified by central government only.
- It is for both conservation & research purposes.
- They are multi-purpose protected areas.
- All plants & animals are preserved (protected) in their natural habitat.
- It promotes research in ecological conservation & environment protection.
- It aims to provide facilities for [[education]] & awareness.
- Protection of terrestrial & marine ecosystem with its unique genetic diversity together with cultural & economic aspects of humans.
### It is divided into 3 areas:
 #pneumonic _cbt_
- _Core area_: for protection, conservation, & management of species.
- _Buffer area_: for monitoring & scientific research, education, training, etc.
- _Transition area_: sustainable human activities like human settlement.
- Limited biotic interference is allowed in biosphere reserve.
- No tourism is allowed in core area & it is limited to buffer & transition areas.
