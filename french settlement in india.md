The first French factory in India was established at Surat in 1668 and later one at Machillipatnam. But they were driven out by the Dutch and the British by [[1720]].
The French settlement in India began in [[1673]] with the purchase of land at Chandernagore from the Mughal Governor of Bengal.
The next year they acquired Pondicherry from the Sultan of Bijapur. Both became the centres of maritime commercial activities of the French in India.
The French secured Mahe in [[1725]] and Karaikal in [[1739]].
