Pulakeshin (IAST: Pulakeśin, r. c. 540–567) was the first sovereign ruler of the Chalukya dynasty of Vatapi (modern Badami). He ruled parts of the present-day [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and Telangana states in the western and central Deccan region of [[India]]. Pulakeshin established the city of Vatapi, and performed the [[Ashvamedha]] sacrifice to assert his sovereign status. The dynasty established by him went on to rule a major part of peninsular India in the subsequent years.
