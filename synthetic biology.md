It is a field of science that involves redesigning organisms for useful purposes by engineering them to have new abilities.
Redesigning organisms can produce substances, such as medicine or fuel, or gain a new ability, such as sensing something in the environment.
Some examples of what scientists are producing with synthetic biology are:
Microorganisms are harnessed for bioremediation to clean pollutants from our water, soil and air.
Rice is modified to produce beta-carotene that prevents vitamin A deficiency.
Yeast engineered to produce rose oil as an eco-friendly and sustainable substitute for real roses.
Production of animal-free dairy products.

Difference between synthetic biology and genome editing
	In synthetic biology, scientists typically stitch together long stretches of DNA and insert them into an organism's genome.
	These synthesized pieces of DNA could be genes that are found in other organisms or they could be entirely novel.
	In genome editing, scientists typically use tools to make smaller changes to the organism's own DNA.
	Genome editing tools can also be used to delete or add small stretches of DNA in the genome.
