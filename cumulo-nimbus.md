- cumulonimbus (from latin cumulus, "heaped" and nimbus, "rainstorm") is a dense, towering vertical cloud, typically forming from water vapor condensing in the lower troposphere that builds upward carried by powerful buoyant air currents. above the lower portions of the cumulonimbus the water vapor becomes ice crystals, such as snow and graupel, the interaction of which can lead to hail and to lightning formation, respectively. when occurring as a thunderstorm these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads. cumulonimbus can form alone, in clusters, or along squall lines. these clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather, such as tornadoes, hazardous winds, and large hailstones. cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell. cumulonimbus is abbreviated cb.
