Mallakhamb is one of the few games that is played against gravity. It functions on a synergy of mind and body, employing every muscle in a way that enables a person to develop speed, stamina and better health.
The name derives from the pole used by wrestlers for practising their skills though, today, Mallakhamb has developed an identity that is separate from wrestling or kushti.
The word Malla means a wrestler or an athlete in Sanskrit and can also indicate a verb, such as strong or good. Khamb or Kham, in spoken Marathi, means a pole. Therefore,
Mallakhamb has come to be known as wrestling against a pole.
Nevertheless, there are two other Mallakhamb styles such as 'rope mallakhamb' and 'hanging mallakhamb'.
The origin of this ancient Indian sport can be traced to an earlier part of the 12th century. A mention of wrestlers exercising on wooden poles is found in the Manasholas, written by Chalukya, in 1153 AD.
It was revived late in the 19th century by Balambhatta Dada Deodhar, physical instructor to Bajirao Peshwa 11.
