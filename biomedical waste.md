bio-medical waste management (amendment) rules, 2018
o bio-medical waste generators including hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, dispensaries, veterinary institutions, animal houses, pathological laboratories, blood banks, health care facilities, & clinical establishments will have to phase out
chlorinated plastic bags (excluding blood bags) & gloves by march 27, 2019.
all healthcare facilities shall make available annual report on its website within a period of 2 years from date of publication of bio-medical waste management (amendment) rules, 2018-
operators of common bio-medical waste treatment & disposal facilities shall establish barcoding & global positioning system for handling of bio-medical waste in accordance with guidelines issued by central pollution control board by march 27, 2019

hazardous waste management rules 2016
o for 1st time, rules have been made to distinguish b/w hazardous waste & other wastes.
other wastes include: waste tyres, paper waste, metal scrap, used electronic items, etc., & are recognized as a resource for recycling & reuse-
these resources supplement industrial processes & reduce load on virgin resource of country. hence, 1 is incorrect as it doesn't have any  provision for phasing to plastic bags.

plastic waste management rules, 2016 aim to:
o increase minimum thickness of plastic carry bags from 40 to 50 microns & stipulate a minimum thickness of 50 microns for plastic sheets also to facilitate collection & recycling of plastic waste
expand jurisdiction of applicability from municipal area to rural areas, because plastic has reached rural areas also-
o to bring in responsibilities of producers & generators, both in plastic waste management system
promote use of plastic waste for road construction as per indian road congress guidelines. hence, 3 is incorrect.
