	- Sankirtana is a ritual singing, drumming and dancing of Manipur encompassing an array of arts performed to mark religious occasions and various stages in the life of the Vaishnava people of the Manipur plains.
	- Sankirtana practices centre on the temple, where performers narrate the lives and deeds of [[lord krishna]] through song and [[dance]]. In a typical performance, two drummers and about ten singer-dancers perform in a hall or domestic courtyard encircled by seated devotees.
	- Sankirtana is not performed by priests and priestesses of the temple. Rather, Lai Haraoba, literally meaning - the merrymaking of the gods, is performed as a ceremonial offering of song and dance. The principal performers are the maibas and maibis (priests and priestesses) who re-enact the theme of the creation of the world.
