1. conservative plate boundary/transform plate boundary
	a. at conservative margins plates slide past each other without any formation of new crust. this boundary is also c/a as parallel or transform plate boundary. transform boundary roughly move parallel to direction of plate movement. ex- san andreas fault of california, where we can observe transform fault along parallel plate boundary. 
	b. transform faults are also found on oceanic crust where they offset oceanic ridges throughout length.

causes of plate  移动s - various reasons behind plate motion are-
	1. convection current
		a. this theory was proposed by arthur holmes. convection currents are generated in earth's interior due to release of intense heat. these currents are of 2 types, 1 involving whole of mantle & other involving only asthenosphere.
		b. as currents ascend from below they diverge & spread laterally, convection would cause lithosphere to split resulting in formation of oceanic ridges. 
		c. as plates move laterally, currents carry slab of lithosphere along with them. 
		d. when these currents encounter a similar from opposite direction they descend into deeper parts of mantle & drag lithosphere down into mantle at trenches.
	2. mantle plume
		a. this is a type of mantle convection involving jet-like plumes of low density material from core mantle boundary.
		b. as plume reaches lithosphere it spreads out laterally doming surface zones of earth & moving them along direction of mantle plumes.  mantle plumes are caucus foe formation of volcanic hotspots.
		c. eg- hawaiian islands, reunion islands
	3. ridge push
		a. magma rising along oceanic ridges form wedges of new lithosphere on either side of trailing edge of plate. it causes causes plates to be pushed apart.
	• gravity sliding
		a. spreading centres spread high on ocean floor. this results in  gravitational sliding of lithospheric slab away from oceanic ridge 
	4. slab pull 
		a. it's considered to be along subduction zones, where sub-ducting plate pulls rest of slab along

# summary	

geography class 13

revision of previous class

plate tectonics theory (continued from previous class..)

earthquake:
is possible wherever there is plate interaction all along boundary whether there is a trench or ridge
nature of earthquake in diff types of boundaries:
in divergence:
oceanic-oceanic (o-o): shallow                                       
continental-continental (c-c): shallow
in convergence
o-o: shallow, intermediate, deep                                        
o-c: shallow, intermediate, deep                             
c-c: shallow, intermediate
in transform:
always shallow, but larger in  number & more destructive in nature 

at zone of subduction or partial subduction(shown in map):

trenches are formed
entire pacific ocean is surrounded by it except southern part which has ridges
implication:
because of trenches(due to subduction), there is a higher chance of volcanic eruptions & earthquake
and  so-c/a as ring of fire
volcanic activity:
is possible wherever there is a subduction zone
it will be very slow & continuous in this because on both side of ridge magma is flowing easily:
ex: entire mid-oceanic ridges
at trenches, subduction zone is violent.

mountain building:

because of compression created by 2 diff plate boundary, there is a formation of elevated landform c/a mountains
oceanic-continent convergence: andes, & rockies
continent-continent convergence leads to much higher fold mountains: himalayas

causes of plate motion:

exogenetic movement
endogenetic movement:
from interior
sources of energy:
primordial heat
and radioactive heat
this energy is released in form of a medium that is magma
for movement of plates there are 5 diff sources/reasons:
convection current
mantle plume
ridge push
gravity sliding
slab pull
1st: theory of convection current
proposed by arthur holms
convection currents are generated in earth's interior due to release of intense heat
these currents are of 2 types:
involving whole mantle
other involving only asthenosphere
as currents ascend from below they diverge & spread laterally convection will cause lithosphere to split resulting in formation of oceanic ridge
as plates move laterally currents carry slab of lithosphere along with them 
when this current encounter a similar current from opposite direction they descend into deeper part of mantle & drag lithosphere down in mantle at trenches
2nd: mantle plume:
a type of mantle convection involving jet-like plumes by low-density material from core-mantle boundary 
as plume reaches lithosphere it spreads out laterally doming surface of earth
ex: yellow stone national park
and moving them along direction of mantle plumes are cause of formation of volcanic hotspots
ex: hawai islands, reunion islands, etc
3rd: ridge push:
magma moving along ocean ridges form wedges of a new lithosphere on either side of trailing edge of plate & causes plates to be pushed apart 
4th: gravity sliding
spreading centers stand high on ocean floor
which results in gravitational sliding of lithospheric slab away from oceanic ridge
5th: slab pull:
it's considered to be along subduction zones where subducting plate pulls rest of slab along

criticism of plate-tectonics:

theory although widely accepted is not able to explain following:
both africa & antarctica are surrounded by ridges & have no subduction zone to accommodate new lithosphere getting generated
plate tectonics in past & how they are diff from each other

next class: rest of geomorphology to be continued...
