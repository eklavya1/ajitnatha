Planning Commission was originally established as a staff agency with advisory role but in the course of time it had emerged as a powerful and directive authority whereby its recommendations were considered both by the Union and states. The critics had described it as a ‘Super Cabinet’, an ‘Economic Cabinet’, a ‘Parallel Cabinet’, the ‘Fifth Wheel of the Coach’ and so on.
