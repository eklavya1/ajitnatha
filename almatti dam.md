the dam is located on the edge of bijapur and bagalkot districts. geographically, it is located in the bijapur district, but large areas of bagalkot district have also been submerged due to filling of the reservoir. the dam holds a gross water storage capacity of 123.08 tmc at 519 meters msl. the backwaters of the dam host several migratory birds during summer.
