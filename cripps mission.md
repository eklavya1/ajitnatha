it was sent by british govt to india in march [[1942]] to obtain indian coop for british war efforts in 2nd world war.
it was headed by sir richard stafford cripps, a labour minister in winston churchill's coalition govt in britain.
mission was headed by stafford cripps.
lord privy seal accompanied him. there were other members from state council including leader of house of common, etc.
setting up of indian dominion. this dominion would have freedom to remain with british commonwealth or to secede from it. it would also be at liberty to take part in international organizations.
a constituent assembly would be formed to frame a new constitution for country. this assembly would have members elected by provincial assemblies & also nominated by princes.
any province unwilling to join indian dominion could form a separate union & have a separate constitution.
transfer of power & rights of minorities would be safeguarded by negotiations b/w constituent assembly & british govt.
in meantime, until this new constitution came into force, india's defence would be controlled by british & powers of govemor-general would remain unaltered.
for 1st time, british govt acknowledged india's right to be a dominion. indians could frame their own constitution.
proposal of giving freedom to provinces to be a separate union turned out to be a model for country's partition in 1947.
right to cede from commonwealth indicated full sovereignty at a later stage. in interim period, indians were guaranteed a good share in administration.
proposals were seen as too radical by british & as too conservative by inc who wanted complete independence.
mission was rejected by 'nc, muslim league, & other indian groups.
hindu mahasabha & liberals were against right of states to secede.
