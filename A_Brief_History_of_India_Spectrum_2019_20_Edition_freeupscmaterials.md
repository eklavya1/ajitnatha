However, there were some weaknesses in Dupleix also, which can be put in brief as follows: (i) Dupleix suffered from an over-sanguine temperament. He hoped too often for too long, thus losing the advantage in critical situations. (ii) The peers of Dupleix didn’t like his autocratic behaviour and on many occasions quarrelled with him on this matter. (iii) Dupleix was not a man of action: he planned a campaign, directed his lieutenants, but never led an army in the battlefield like Lawrence or Clive. The [[French]] failed to capture Trichinopoly (1752-53) because the schemes thought out by Dupleix could not be turned into action by his commanders. — location: [945]()

Significantly, in the Battle of Wandiwash, natives served in both the armies as sepoys.

Causes for the English Success and the [[French]] Failure The English company was a private enterprise—this created a sense of enthusiasm and self-confidence among the people.

The Sikhs, Marathas and Rajputs did not possess the capacity to overthrow the empire; they merely resisted Mughal power to gain and keep their independence in their respective territories.

Weaknesses of People’s Uprisings ● These uprisings drew a large [[number]] of participants but were, in fact, localised and occurred at different times in different regions. ● They mostly arose out of local grievances. ● The leadership was semi-feudal in character, backwardlooking, traditional in outlook and their resistance did not offer alternatives to the existing social set-up. ● If many of these revolts seemed similar to one another in wanting to oust the alien rule, it was not because of some ‘national’ impulse or common effort, but because they were protesting against conditions that were common to them. ● These rebellions were centuries-old in form and ideological / cultural content. ● Those who were not so uncooperative or obstinate were pacified through concessions by the authorities. ● The methods and arms used by the fighters in these uprisings were practically obsolete compared to the weapons and strategy—as well as deception and chicanery—employed by their opponents. — location: [2567]()

The earlier reformist zeal of a self-confident Victorian liberalism evaporated as many liberals in Britain began to believe that Indians were beyond reform.

Modern Western thought and scientific ideas were not absorbed by Muslim intellectuals, who remained traditional and backward. Even when, as a result of the efforts of reformers, modern education spread among Muslims, the proportion of the educated was far lower among Muslims than among Hindus, Parsis or Christians. The Muslims also lagged behind as participants in the growth of trade and industry. As the [[number]] of educated persons and men of trade and industry among the Muslims was rather small, it was easy for the reactionary big landlords and the richer classes to continue to wield influence over the Muslim masses. Landlords and zamindars, whether Hindu or Muslim, supported the British rule out of self-interest. But, among the Hindus, the modern intellectuals and the rising commercial and industrialist class had taken over the leadership from the old order of landlords. — location: [6867]()

The British were quick to learn from their experience of 1857—an organised mass action could pose a serious challenge to the existence of British rule in India. The rulersubject gap was sought to be narrowed so as to reduce, if not eliminate altogether, the alienation of the masses from the administration. Also, association of natives in administration could give the rulers an opportunity to have a better idea of the customs, traditions and values of the people they were supposed to rule.

The Belchi incident was exploited to her own advantage by Indira Gandhi. She travelled to Belchi, the last bit on an elephant as there was no clear path on which to even walk to reach the village, and showed her sympathy for the affected people. Besides showing up the Janata government as callous to the poor and marginalised, Indira Gandhi’s action built up her own image as a friend of the poor and the Harijans even as her party members were made to realise that she was the leader to follow if power was to be regained. — location: [9983]()

Implementation of the Mandal [[commission]] Report The Mandal [[commission]] appointed during the Janata party rule had submitted its report in December 1980. The Congress governments under Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had quietly shelved the report. The Mandal [[commission]] or the Backward Classes [[commission]] – to give it its official name – said that caste and backwardness were linked, and that the other backward castes, despite forming a significant proportion of the country’s population, had very low representation in the administration, especially at the higher levels. In this context, the main recommendation made by the [[commission]] was that 27 per cent of jobs in the central government be reserved for these castes beyond the percentage reserved for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The same kind of relaxation in age was also to be made for the OBCs as existed for SC/ST in being considered for posts. — location: [10434]()

Causes There was rising discontent of the sepoys against the British rule due to the following reasons: (i) discrimination in payment and promotions; (ii) mistreatment of the sepoys by the British officials; (iii) refusal of the government to pay foreign service allowance while fighting in remote regions; (iv) religious objections of the high caste Hindu sepoys to Lord Canning’s General Service Enlistment Act (1856) ordering all recruits to be ready for service both within and outside India. Further, the sepoys shared all the discontent and grievances—social, religious and economic—that afflicted the civilian population. Over the years, the upper caste sepoys had found their religious beliefs in conflict with their service conditions. For example, in 1806, the replacement of the turban by a leather cockade caused a mutiny at Vellore. Similarly in 1844, there was a mutinous outbreak of the [[bengal]] army sepoys for being sent to far away Sind and in 1824 the sepoys at Barrackpore rose in revolt when they were asked to go to Burma because crossing the sea would mean loss of caste. — location: [2553]()
