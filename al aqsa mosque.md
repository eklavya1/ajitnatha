- Al-Aqsa Mosque (Arabic: الجامع الأقصى, romanized: al-Jāmi' al-Aqṣā), also known as the Qibli Mosque (المصلى القبلي, al-Muṣallā al-Qiblī), is a congregational mosque in the Old City of [[Jerusalem]] located at the southern end of the holy site or esplanade known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and which can also be known in its entirety, including the Dome of the Rock, the Qibli Mosque and the surrounding walled courtyard, as the Al-Aqsa Mosque.The congregational mosque building was originally a small prayer house erected by Umar, the second Rashidun caliph, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the [[7th century]]. It was rebuilt and expanded during the Umayyad Caliphate. The mosque was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 746 and rebuilt by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur in 754. It was rebuilt again in 780. Another earthquake destroyed most of al-Aqsa in 1033, but two years later the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir built another mosque whose outline is preserved in the current structure.

- During the periodic renovations undertaken, the Islamic ruling dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minbar, minarets and the interior structure. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace. The structure was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was recaptured by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council, and Jordan. Today, the Old City is under Israeli control, but the mosque remains under the administration of the Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf.The mosque is located in close proximity to historical sites significant in Judaism and Christianity, most notably the site of the Second Temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. As a result, the area is highly sensitive, and has been the main flashpoint in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
