[[plate tectonics]]
1. term “plate” was coined bye j.t. wilson in [[1965]]
2. crust & mantle are 1 single unit
3. proposed in [[1967]] by morgan & team of mackenzie & parker (both work separately) [[indira gandhi]] | [[lal bahadur shastri#^2d8afe]]
4. entire size of [[earth]] is maintained, cycle of nature
5. _movement of outer lithosphere is there, which is composed of crust & mantle_
6. movement is not smooth, very rigid which is responsible for formation of mountains & trenches
7. plates are broad, rigid segments of lithosphere which includes crust & rigid upper part of upper mantle
8. plate tectonics is study of deformations within plates & of interaction of plates around their margins. plate tectonics theory was _proposed by morgan & mackenzie & parker separately in 1967_.
9. as per plate tectonics theory, lithosphere which is made up of diff plates floats on underlying asthenosphere. plates are nearly 100 kilometres in thickness & how high rigidity & are unable to deform except in response to a very strong & prolonged forces.
	1. differences with respect to continental drift theory-
		1. cdt, proposed that sial layer is floating over sima layer whereas plate tectonics theory proposed that both sial & sima are adjacent to each other & are part of lithosphere.

	2. plate movements (movement of plates- plates are constantly in motion but with diff speed in diff directions. this results in 3 types of plate boundaries.). plate boundaries are zone of motion b/w 2 diff plates.

1. when 2 oceanic plates collide with each other, oceanic plate of higher density descends into asthenosphere. this is c/a as subduction & region is c/a as subduction zone. this leads to formation of trenches, i.e. deepest regions on surface of earth. 	1. this type of interaction occurs when a plate carrying oceanic crust collides 跟 plate carrying continental crust to continental crust being more buoyant, forces higher density oceanic crust into mantle.	1. when 2 plates carrying continental crust collide, it results in this type of plate boundary.
2. eg- where pacific plate collide with eurasian plate, it has resulted in japan trench, mariana trench, etc	2. ex- nazca plate subducting below south american plate. during subduction thick sequence of rocks along continental margin is compressed & deformed to form a chain of fold mountains. eg- andes & rockies [[rocky mountains]]	2. ex, collision of indian & eurasian plates. 
3. sub-ducting plate starts to melt as it reaches deeper parts & some of its. molten material finds its way upward in form of volcanic activity. this molten material piles up continuously on adjacent oceanic oceanic floor forming volcanic islands. continuous volcanic activity gradually increases size & elevation of volcanic islands.	3. as oceanic plate subduction it creates trenches, earthquakes are generated at [[benioff zone]]s (https://t.me/c/1395402788/102) & as oceanic plate plunges deeper it gets melted add starts to rise. this rising magma will be enplaced in underlying continental crust which may eventually migrate to surface leading to formation of volcanoes ex-subduction of nazca plate below south american plate has resulted in volcanoes of ojos del salado, cotopaxi, chimborazo on andes	3. prior to continental collision, land masses are separated by oceanic crust as these 2 plates converge intervening sea encloses near sea floor subducts beneath 1 of plates.

plate tectonics theory (01:16 pm).

term 'plate' was coined by j.t.wilson in 1965.
plates are broad, rigid segments of lithosphere which includes crust & rigid upper part of upper mantle.
plate tectonics is study of deformations within plates & of interaction of plates around their margins.
plate tectonics theory was proposed by morgan, mckenzie, & parker separately in 1967.
as per plate tectonics theory, lithosphere which is made up of diff plates floats on underlying asthenosphere.
plates are nearly 100 km in thickness & have high rigidity & are unable to deform except in response to very strong & prolonged forces.
differences w.r.t continental drift theory:
cdt proposed that sial layer is floating over sima layer, whereas, ptt proposes that both sial & sima are adjacent to each other & are part of lithosphere.
continents float very smoothly over oceans as per cdt, whereas, ptt proposes that a high resistance is offered by lithosphere while moving over asthenosphere.
there are a total of seven major plates & many minor plates.
7 major plates - pacific plate, north american plate, south america plate, african plate, eurasian plate, indo- australian plate, antarctica plate.

movements of plates:

plates are constantly in motion but at diff speeds in diff directions. this results in 3 types of plate boundaries i.e. convergent, divergent, & conservative.
plate boundaries are zone of motion b/w 2 diff plates.
divergent plate boundary (constructive plate boundary):
oceanic-oceanic divergence-
these are zones of tension where lithosphere splits, separates, & move apart in opposite directions.
hot magma comes up through cracks, solidifies, & leads to formation of new crust.
gradually, elevated ridge is formed along zone of divergence. this is also a zone of shallow earthquakes.
activities= rifting of ocean crust-->magma eruption--> creation of new crust--> formation of mor-->divergence.
continental-continental divergence-
divergence along continents involves 3 diff stages.
intra-continental rifting= it involves fragmentation of continent by upward movement of convection currents in form of a rising plume of molten rock from below. it causes creation of numerous cracks & rifts valleys. rising magma starts to come out of this rift. ex= east african rift valley.
interplate thinning= it involves partial melting of lithosphere & gradual thinning of continental plates. rift valley starts to widen & may gradually get filled with oceanic water (partial melting--> widening of rift--> shallow sea.). ex= red sea.
oceanic ridge formation= continuous spreading of plates & creation of new plate material along rift valley pushes continental mass sufficiently apart. at this stage, there will be a new oceanic basin along both sides of ridge. ex= mid atlantic ridge.
convergent plate boundary (destructive plate boundary):
oceanic-oceanic convergence-
when 2 oceanic plates collide with each other, oceanic plate of higher density descends into asthenosphere.
this process is c/a subduction & region is c/a as subduction zone.
this leads to formation of trenches i.e. deepest regions on surface of earth.
ex= where pacific plate collides with eurasian plate, it has resulted in japan trench, mariana trench.
subducting plate starts to melt as it reaches deeper parts & some of its molten material finds its way upward in form of volcanic activity.
this molten material piles up continuously on adjacent oceanic floor forming volcanic islands.
continuous volcanic activity gradually increases size & elevation of volcanic islands.
subducting plate experiences great resistance & friction due to which a large number of earthquakes occur.
zone of such a large number of earthquakes near subduction zone is c/a as benioff zone.
volcanic islands which are arranged parallel to trench in a form of arc are c/a island arc. ex= japan, aleutian islands, etc.
an archipelago is a group of islands scattered in ocean.
they are formed around o-o convergent plate boundary with intense volcanic activity & shifting tectonic plates.
ex= indonesia & philippines.
subduction zones are sites of most widespread & intense earthquakes. in case of o-o collision, all 3 types of earthquakes (i.e. shallow, intermediate, & deep) can be found.

topic for next class= plate tectonics theory (to be continued).
