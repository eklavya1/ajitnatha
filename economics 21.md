recap of previous class discussion
(1:10 pm)

## currency swap agreement
- (1:18 pm) [[currency swap agreement]]

- they swap for their benefits or minimize risk.

## ni
- (1:25 pm)
- nnp at factor cost which is equal to nnp- it + s.
- by removing effect of taxes & subsidies.

- relations b/w investment savings.
- estimation of gdp in india.
- limitation of gdp esp as a measure of ni
- some alternatives

## saving - investment relations
(1:35 pm)

- a savings-investment relationship is a relationship in which 1 is necessary for other but excess of 1 over other causes problems for other. to understand saving relations we look at incomes earned in economy from their utilization perspective.
- [[income]] earned = [[profit]] + r + wages + interest
- incomes can be utilized in 3 possible ways i.e. either they are consumed, saved, or taxed. therefore incomes = c + s + t (consumed + saved + taxed) ie
	- i = c+s+t
- since from our circular flow model, we know that incomes are equal to expenditure received. [[circular flow of income]]
- therefore, p + w + r + interest = c + s + t
- p + w + r + interest = aggregate demand (ad) = c + s + t + (x-m)
- using equation 1 & 2
- (s-i) = (g-t) + (x-m)
- saving investment gap (s-i) = excess of govt spending over taxes (fiscal deficit, g-t) + net export (x-m)
- assuming a closed economy that is x & m is 0 & assuming a balanced budget. it means g & t are equal. then s-i = 0, or s=i.
- this means in economy saving would be necessary for investment to occur. for economy to remain to be in equilibrium, saving would have to transform into investment.
- in a more real-world economy, both (g-t) & (x-m) may be non-zero. & therefore, some of savings may not be available for investment. for ex, if govt spends more than taxes collected, it means some part of savings are being used by govt to spend in excess of what it earns. therefore, amount available to firms for investments is less.
- if a current account deficit's greater than a fiscal deficit. it means country has a negative investment gap. here (s-i) is less than zero. here investment is greater than savings.
- if a [[current account deficit]]'s less than a [[fiscal deficit]]. it means country has a positive investment gap. here (s-i) is greater than zero. here investment is less than savings.
- savings & investment are intrinsically interlinked with each other.
- if savings are more then investment will increase. however, after a limit, they start affecting each other negatively as well. _like 2 lovebirds_
- savings while mobilizing investment, also hamper investment.
- crowding out occurs when govt spends more than tax collected by it. it reduces investment in private investment.
## incremental capital output ratio (icor)
- (2:42 pm)
- [[incremental capital output ratio]]
- it refers to amount of capital required to increase output by 1 unit from existing level of output.
- icor = incremental/output (ideally we desire a lower value).
- higher ICOR worse or difficult it's for economy to produce 1 extra unit of output.
- a lower icor is desirable.
- when govt spent more than taxes, it crowds out private investment which leads to less money being available for private firms to invest.

## estimation of gdp
(3:02 pm)

- [[gdp]] measurement in india
- we have to define our scope of measurement, what is it that we need to measure. for whom we are going to measure. these firms or producers.

1st define what is production & what is not.


identify what is being produced


cso under guidance of nsc combines data gathering from surveys.

2nd measure quantity & value of what is produced.


identify a sample space representative of economy.




from gathered data, it extrapolates production level for those that cannot be & has not been measured.



3rd sum up all what is measured.


measure their output through survey-nsso collects information.




data is extrapolated & combined using assumptions. assumptions are rationally justified & follow standards laid down by imf’s national system of accounts.

4th from what is measured, estimate what has not been measured.




now, entities submit their production data themselves ay mca21 database.




- in next survey, sample may change, data sets may change hence, need to ensure comparability across years. again, assumptions are made while backtracking data for other years.

- gdp is estimated by 1st measuring output produced of a sample of firms in economy & from that, we estimate output of all firms in economy.
- first, we define what is that is considered as output produced. for ex, a firm may be producing multiple goods or services, for that firm, we define 1st that which goods & services will be measured & which'll be not.
- second, we define all firm’s output will be measured i.e. which firm would be part of sample space.
- third, once we measure output of all firms in sample, we try to extrapolate from this information, output of those firms that were not in sample.
- we combine total output & present final estimate of what is value of output produced in economy.
- while extrapolating, there would be a lot of assumptions. these assumptions may have effect of either overestimating or underestimating total output.
- these assumptions are based on principles laid by imf in its system of national accounts (sna). under sna, imf conveys to country what standard practices need to be followed for estimation of gdp. for ex, how will value of output of a related firm in same sector be estimated from value of output of a firm which was part of a sample space & hence measured.
- similarly, how will appreciation of assets that exist in economy be counted in national incomes- standard is since they are not produced this year, therefore, they will not be counted in value of output of this year.
- further, there are issues even in such standards. for ex, land exists as part of earth for billions of years, what if land is sold this year b/w 2 people?- since land wasn't produced, then how could it be included in this year's output.
- only its value has been appreciated, nothing else.
- therefore land which is sold will not be part of gdp of a country.
- as opposed to land, minerals in land if they are produced this year, their value will be part of this year’s production.

- reserves of minerals in land are not part of year’s gdp rather they will become a part only once they are extracted & produced. such standards are laid by imf so that there is least discrepancy in a country’s gdp measurement hence a fair comparison can be had.

- post-2015, measurement of gdp in india is done using value-added method. earlier gdp estimates were based on output annual survey of industries (asi) which comprised of 20,000 industries with their output information. survey is still carried output & many organizations including rbi, estimate gdp using asi data only.

- in [[2015]], we switched over to mca21 database available with ministry of corporate affairs as primary sample for gdp estimation.

- mca21 database comprises, at present, about 15 lakh firms that submit their expenditures & revenue statements with govt on a regular basis. therefore need to estimate gdp through asi survey is no longer there, rather estimation is done by adding gross value added by all firms submitting their information to mca21. gdp is then calculated by adding indirect taxes collected by govt & subtracting subsidies paid by govt to gross value added.

- in this method, we do not have to care which firm is final producer. by adding indirect taxed & subtracting subsidies gives gdp of country or any economy.

## limitations with gdp
(4:15 pm)
- gdp is most commonly used measure of national income throughout world. despite its popularity, there are certain limitations:
	- gdp does not convey distribution of production or incomes, i.e. it does not convey anything about inequality. a nation’s gdp can be high when production is controlled by only a few & factor incomes are distributed only among a handful.
	- non-monetary exchanges are not measured by gdp, these do take place in economy, it's just that since they are not valued by market, therefore, they are ignored, gdp does not convey anything about externalities that is whether goods produced are harmful or useful society.
	- existence of informal sector makes gdp estimation very difficult. informal sector’s output cannot usually be measured either  b/c most of them are small in size, most of them are unregistered with govt, or also many would not like to declare their output.
	- this is further complicated by existence of black economy, developing countries therefore consistently underestimate their gdp due to large informal sector.
	- gdp measures value & therefore is dependent on prices. market value consists of taxes which may be increased from time to time that may lead to inflating gdp value.
	- finally, diff methods of gdp estimation produce a diff value of gdp due to difficulty in their measurement causing discrepancies.
- despite its shortcoming, gdp remains most popular measure. this is so  b/c gdp is most standardized measure & has maximum objectivity. other measures such as human development index, green gdp, gross national happiness, etc. are even more subjective & thus difficult to standardize.
- lastly gdp information is most quickly available & therefore comparison can be timely done. using gdp as a measure of national income is therefore  b/c of its acceptable objectivity & great convenience. what we interpret from gdp should be done by keeping its limitation in mind.
