### recommendations
1. three-tier system of panchayati raj should be replaced by two-tier system, that is, zila parishad at district level, and below it, mandal panchayat consisting of a group of villages with a total population of 15,000 to 20,000.
2. A district should be first point for decentralisation under popular supervision below state level.
3. Zila parishad should be executive body and made responsible for planning at district level.
4. There should be an official participation of political parties at all levels of panchayat elections.
5. panchayati raj institutions should have compulsory powers of taxation to mobilise their own financial resourses.
6. There *should be a regular social audit by a district level agency and by a committee of legislators to check whether funds allotted for vulnerable social and economic groups are actually spent on them*
7. state government should not supersede panchayati raj institutions. In case of an imperative supersession, elections should be held within six months from date of supersession.
8. nyaya panchayats should be kept as separate bodies from that of development panchayats. They should be presided over by a qualified judge.
9. chief electoral officer of a state in consultation with chief election commissioner should organise and conduct panchayati raj elections.
10. Development functions should be transferred to zila parishad and all development staff should work under its control and supervision.
11. voluntary agencies should play an important role in mobilising support of people for panchayati raj.
12. A minister for panchayati raj should be appointed in state council of ministers to look after affairs of panchayati raj institutions.
13. Seats for SCs and STs should be reserved on basis of their [[population]].
14. A constitutional recognition should be accorded to Panchayati Raj institutions. This would give them requisite status (sanctity and stature) and an assurance of continuous functioning.
