# summary

Polity Class 17

Article 32

    This contains constitutional remedies to enforcement of FRs given under PART III
    U/A 32 (1): right to move Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of FR.
    Appropriate Proceedings:
    SC gives liberal interpretation to "Appropriate Proceedings".
    There is no standard format.
    A person can reach CJI/ Judges of SC. SC has to interfere to protect FRs.
    For ex, complaints via postcards, Messages, etc. can be entertained.
    Article 32 (2): Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs,
    Article 32 (2) specifically talks about 5 types of writs.
    These writs are Habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo warranto, & [[certiorari]].
    U/A 32 (3), Parliament by law can confer any other court all powers which are exercised by SC. 

Article 226

    High Court shall have powers, throughout territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue directions, orders, or writs,  for enforcement of any of rights conferred by Part III & for any other purpose.

Difference Art 32 & Art 226

    Writ jurisdictions of high courts are narrower than [[Polity 09|SC]] when it comes to matters of territorial Jurisdiction only.
    But Writ Jurisdiction of HC (FR & other legal rights) is wider than that of [[Polity 09|SC]] in matters of rights.
    [[Art]] 32 in itself is a fundam[[Polity 09|en]]tal right where [[Polity 09|SC]] is duty-bound (mandatory) to provide Constitutional remedy.
    right to move to court under [[[[[[Art]]]]]][[may| 22]]6 is not a fundamental right so HC can exercise their discretion [[may|and]] may dismiss petition.
    SC cannot refuse relief under article 32 on ground:
    That aggrieved person may have his remedy from some other court or under ordinary law.
    disputed facts have to be investigated or evidence has to be taken before relief may be given to petitioner.
    That petitioner has not asked for proper writ applicable to case.
    That aggrieved person has not approached SC (but this is applicable only in certain [[cases]])

Principle of Loci Standi:

    Only aggrieved party can approach Cour[[writs|t.

W]]RITS

    Supreme Court is guarantor of  FRs given under PART III.
    These are mentioned in Article 32.
    Types of Writs:
    Habeas Corpus: 
    It means to ‚Äúhave body of‚Äù individual illegally detained by individual body/ state authorities etc.
    If a person is imprisoned or detained illegally or unlawfully then person has to be physically presented in front of court.
    court would examine reasons for detention & if no legal justification is present then person would be set free.
    Note: principle of "Locus standi" is not applicable for this writ.
    By this writ, therefore, court secures body of a person.
    person who has been imprisoned is to be brought before court
    court obtains knowledge of reason why he has been imprisoned & set him free if there is no lawful justification for imprisonment.
    writ may be addressed to any person whether official or a private person who has another person in his custody.
    Disobedience of writ's met punishment for contempt of court.
    Mandamus
    Literally means ‚Äúa command‚Äù.
    This writ demands some activity on part of body or person to whom it's addressed to perform some public duty which he has refused to perform.
    In such a case, order/writ can be issued by court to authority to do something specified in writ.
    This order can be issued to either a public official or inferior court.
    This is a writ that is issued to awaken authority out of their sleep & to do something.
    essential conditions to issuance of Writ of Mandamus are:
    Prove violation of a Fundamental Right.
    Prove non-performance of duty.
    There should be a demand & refusal.
    exception to writ of Mandamus are:
    Cannot be issued against a private individual;
    Cannot be issued against president & governor,
    Can not be issued against legislator;
    Cannot be issued for imposition of a tax;
    Note: principle of Locus standi is applicable for this writ.
    Certiorari:
    writ's issued to quash order of a court/tribunal for enforcement of FR
    This writ can be issued to only inferior court or a [[tribunal]] & not to executive authority
    This writ's issued when
    inferior court has either exceeded its jurisdiction
    or usurped a jurisdiction with which it's not legally vested or
    court has acted contrary to principle of Natural Justice or
    because decision has been obtained by fraud/ collusion/ or corruption.
    SC has held in multiple cases, Whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting rights of subjects & having duty to act judicially acts in excess of their legal authority, a writ of [[certiorari]] may be issued.
    Therefore, meaning a writ of certiorari can be availed only to remove validity of judicial acts including exercise of Quasi-judicial function by administrative bodies in contrast with what are purely administrative actions.
[[note|    ]]Note: principle of "Locus standi" is applicable for this writ.
    [[Prohibition]]:
    writ of prohibition is issued by a court to inferior court forbidding latter to continue proceedings.
    difference b/w prohibition & certiorari are:
    Certiorari is issued to quash order/dec[[tribunal|ision of]] tribunal/court.
    While prohibition is issued to prohibit court or [[tribunal]] from making [[ultra vires]] order or decision.
    As a result, prohibition is available during pendency of proceeding & before order is made.
    While Certiorari can be issued only after order ha[[quo warranto|s been made.]]
