The judgments, proceedings, and acts of the high courts are recorded for perpetual memory and testimony.
These records are admitted to be of evidentiary value and cannot be questioned when produced before any subordinate court.
They are recognized as legal precedents and legal references.
It has the power to punish for contempt of court, either with simple imprisonment or with a fine, or with both.
A high court also has the power to review and correct its own judgment or order or decision, *even though no specific power of review is conferred on it by the Constitution.*
The *Supreme Court, on the other hand, has been specifically conferred with the power of review by the constitution.*
*The expression contempt of court' has not been defined by the Constitution.*
However, the expression has been defined by the [[contempt of courts act, 1971]] Under this, contempt of court may be civil or criminal.
