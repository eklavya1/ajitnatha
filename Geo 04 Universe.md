- [[big bang theory]] or expanding earth theory given by `edwin hubble`. acc to it, in beginning, all matters forming universe existed in 1 place in form of a "tiny ball" with unimaginable small volume, infinite [[temperature]] & infinite density. at big bang, that took place 13.7 billion years before present, "tiny ball" exploded & thereafter universe continues to expand. this is most widely accepted theory.
- steady-state theory was 1st put forward in [[1948]] by [[british]] scientists sir hermann bondi, thomas gold, & sir fred hoyle as alternative to big-bang hypothesis. acc to it, universe is always expanding but maintaining a constant average density, with matter being continuously created to form new stars & galaxies at same rate that old ones become unobservable as a consequence of their increasing distance & velocity of recession. a steady-state universe has no beginning or end in time, & from any point within it view on grand scale—i.e., average density & arrangement of galaxies—is same. galaxies of all possible ages are intermingled.
- *big splat theory*: it's related to formation of [[moon]] as a satellite to earth. acc to it, a body of size 1 to 3 times that of [[mars]] collided into earth sometimes shortly after earth was formed. it blasted a large part of earth into space. this continued to orbit around earth & eventually formed present moon around 4.44 billion years ago. ^5ac66f
