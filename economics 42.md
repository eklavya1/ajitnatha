- brief review of the previous class (1:05 pm)
## vat (1:14 pm)
- since [[2005]], sales tax in the states is levied on the value-added and not the entire value of the sales transaction. this new way of levying sales tax was itself called vat (value added tax)
- under the vat system, only the value added at any stage is taxed, rather than the total value. the objective is to decrease the tax burden by making the taxation system fair, and thus increasing compliance
- how would vat be levied?
- for that, we need to understand something called input tax credit (itc). this system is based on the taxable value at the previous (input) stage and the proof of tax paid on it, i.e., the bill, which is offset against the tax to be paid at the later (output) stage
- for detailed information kindly refer gst handout (uploaded on 8th march)

## gst (2:16 pm)
refer to the handouts (uploaded)
## tax elasticity and tax buoyancy (3:45 pm)
- tax elasticity -it refers to the responsiveness of the tax revenues to the taxation system i.e. the change in taxes collected (or growth) when some aspect of the taxation system changes
- tax buoyancy - %change in taxes/%change in gdp. it represents how responsive are taxed to growth in gdp.
- laffer curve - the laffer curve describes the relationship between tax rates and total tax revenue, with an optimal tax rate that maximizes total government tax revenue.

## tax evasion and tax avoidance (4:01 pm)
- tax planning – legal, legitimate way to reduce taxable income through certain acceptable expenses/investments
- tax avoidance – is not illegal, but certainly illegitimate
- tax evasion – illegal
- kindly refer to handouts for detailed information

## base erosion and profit shifting (beps) (4:12 pm)
- base erosion and profit shifting (beps) refers to tax planning strategies used by multinational enterprises that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to avoid paying tax. 

## related party transactions and arm’s length principle and advanced pricing agreements (4:16 pm)
- a related-party transaction is an arrangement between two parties that have a preexisting business relationship
- apa will be signed between an entity and the government or even more than one government where it will be agreed that pricing will be based on arm's length principle
- g20 and oecd countries have developed a multilateral framework to counter beps through the automatic exchange of information.
