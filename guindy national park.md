It is a tiny protected area measuring just 270.57 hectares (ha) that serves as the green lungs to a great metropolitan city in Tamil Nadu.
Guindy is India's eighth-smallest national park and one of the very few national parks located inside a city.
The park is an extension of the grounds surrounding Raj Bhavan, formerly known as the 'Guindy Lodge' , the official residence of the govemor of Tamil Nadu.
The area where the national park is located was once spread across five sq km. It was one of the last remnants of the tropical dry evergreen forests of the Coromandel Coast.
Guindy National Park is one of the last homes of relict vegetation, the Carnatic coastal or tropical dry evergreen forest type of the Coromandel coast according to naturalists
Harry G Champion and SK Seth.
Now, this vegetation is reclassified as the Albizia Amara Boiv community.
The ecosystem consists of the rare tropical dry evergreen scrub and thom forests that receive about 1 ,200 millimeters of rainfall annually.
About 350 species of plants have been identified so far including trees, shrubs, climbers, herbs, and grasses.
A large portion of the area is under the mixed dry deciduous scrub jungle.
As leaves fall off in deciduous vegetation, the entire vegetation looks dry during summers.
But with the onset of the monsoon, the vegetation acquires a green appearance with new leaves.
The open grassland found here is an ideal habitat for blackbucks.
The wealth of plant life inside the park is unique.
Guindy National Park is thus a significant piece of land that acts as green lungs of the city, fighting against the onslaught of environmental degradation, pollution, and unsustainable development.
