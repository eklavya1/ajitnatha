## tower radiation
radiation can be defined as transmission of energy in form of waves.
radiation which emits from cell phones or cell towers is of non-lonic in nature which has very low [[energy]] & can induce only thermal effect due to generation of heat.
radiation from a cell phone or cell tower has less penetration power unlike ionic radiations like uv rays, gamma rays which can penetrate into human body & cause health issues.
in india, handsets are not allowed to emit radiation more than 1.6 watt/kilo which is c/a sar or specific absorption ratio & india's safety factor is 10 times stiffer than in 90% of countries that follow standards
set by international commission on non-ionising radiation protection.
however mobile towers do not damage human health as long as emission levels are kept under control & are within regulations.
# impact of radiation from mobile phone towers
## health impacts
every antenna on a cell phone tower radiates electromagnetic radiation (power).
one cell phone tower is being used by a number of operators, more number of antennas more is power intensity in nearby area.
power level near towers is higher & reduces as we move away.
emr may cause cellular & psychological changes in human beings due to thermal effects that are generated due to absorption of microwave radiation.
exposure can lead to genetic defects, effects on reproduction & development, central nervous system behaviour, etc. hence, 2 & 3 are correct.
emr can also cause non-thermal effects which are caused by radiofrequency fields at levels too low to produce significant heating & are due to movement of calcium & other ions across cell membranes.
such exposure is known to be responsible for fatigue, nausea, irritability, headaches, loss of appetite, & other psychological disorders.
current exposure safety standards are purely based on thermal effects considering a few pieces of evidence from exposure to non-thermal effects.

## impact on birds
surface area of a bird is relatively larger than their body weight in comparison to human body, so they absorb more radiation.
also, fluid contained in body of bird is less due to its small body weight, so it gets heated up very fast.
magnetic field from towers disturbs birds' navigation skills; hence when birds are exposed to emr they disorient & begin to fly in all directions.
it also causes browning & drying of treetops.
