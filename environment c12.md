Environment Class 12

Current affairs were discussed (1.06 PM)

Delhi‚Äôs first smog tower in CP
VAYU- NEERI and CSIR have developed a device to address air pollution at high traffic zones like traffic intersections and parking areas.
National Clean Air Programme
It is for 122 non-attainment cities which failed to maintain air quality.
Identified based on AQI data from 2014- 2018.
The target is to reduce 20% to 30% in the particulate matter based on the base year 2017 by 2924.
It is an initiative of MOEFCC.
Promotion of clean energy (1.35 PM)
Eg- Renewable energy
India has kept the target of 500 GW by 2030 (Glasgow climate change summit, COP-26)
Reduction (minimization) of consumption of coal- thermal power stations to 68%.

## International Solar Alliance (ISA)

NISE Gurugram- HQ of ISA
COP-23 (Paris summit 2015)
1000 Billion USD investment in 10 years in solar power.

## Hydrogen- CNG (Hydrogen Gas blended with CNG)
(1.45 PM)

It has a high calorific value (combustion).
Minimize release of air pollutant gases like CO2, CO, NOx, SO2 etc.
Presently, 1/5th of hydrogen blended with CNG
2H2+O2= 2h2O (water vapour)
It is environmental friendly.
Biofuel (Bioethanol and biodiesel)

## National Biofuel Policy

Promotion of 2G and 3G bio-fuel.
Basic and advanced biofuel
Setting up of bio-refineries.

## 2 important Agreements on Air Pollution (1.57 PM)

Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention
It is an Intergovernmental Convention.
It is also a regional convention (Europe).
Nodal implementing organization is UNECE (UN European Commission on Economics)
Dictation- 2.03 PM
It is a common framework for Transboundary cooperation on air pollution.
In 1979, 32 countries in the pan- European region decided to cooperate to reduce air pollution by creating the first international treaty to deal with air pollution on a broad regional basis.
The convention entered into force in 1983, laying down the general principles of international cooperation for air pollution abatement and setting up an institutional framework for the promotion of research and policy.
Over the years, the number of substances covered by this convention, and its protocols has been gradually extended, notably to ground-level ozone, POPs, heavy metals and PM.

## Gothenburg Protocol

Protocol- legally binding agreement
One of the protocols under the convention on Transboundary air pollution.
1999, Gothenburg protocol addresses pollution caused due to acid rain, eutrophication and ground-level ozone.
It was adopted on 30th November 1999.
The protocol sets the national emissions ceiling/ cap for 2010 up to 2020 for the following:
Sulphur dioxide
NOx
Volatile Organic Compounds
Ammonia (NH3)
It thus builds on the previous protocols that addressed sulphur emissions (1995 protocol, 1994 protocol)- VOC and NOx.
Parties whose emissions have a more severe environmental or health impact and whose emissions are relatively cheap to reduce, low cost has to make the biggest emission cuts.
Parties have to report on their emissions once a year.

Dictation- 2.36 PM

Vienna Convention for the protection of ozone layer was adopted in 1985 and got ratified coming into effect in 1988.
It reached universal ratification in 2009.
This agreement is a framework convention that lays out principles agreed upon by many parties.
It does not however require countries to take control action to protect the ozone layer.
Montreal Protocol is a legally binding agreement brought under the Vienna convention to phase out ozone-depleting substances in the year 1987 and following ratification entered into force in 1989.
This protocol has been successful in establishing legally binding controls for developed and developing countries on the production and consumption of halogen source gases known to cause ozone depletion.
This protocol provides financial and technological support from developed countries to developing countries.
Kigali Agreement a new landmark deal in 2016 in Rwanda was adopted to reduce the emission of the category of Green House Gases which leads to hydro fluorocarbons.
Its reduction could prevent up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of global warming by the year 2100.
The parties have been divided into 3 groups with different timelines to phase out production and consumption of HFCs by 80% to 85% by the end of 2050.

Group

Group- 1 (Rich and developed countries like US, EU, Australia, Canada etc)


85%

2018


2036


15%

Group- II

China, Brazil, Russia, South Africa, and other African nations


80%


2021


2024


2045


20%

Group III

India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia etc


85%


2024 to 2026 levels


2028 (freeze use of HFC)


2047


15%

## Importance of Kigali agreement
80% to 85% removal of HFCs by 2050.
By doing so, a 0.5-degree temperature rise of the earth by 2100 can be prevented.
Supporting initiatives of the Paris agreement under the UNFCCC.
The agreement lacks bindingness and lacks universal membership.
Significance of Kigali agreement (3.30 PM-dictations)
The Kigali agreement amended the Montreal Protocol to include HFCs reductions responsible for global warming.
It also has provisions for penalties for non-compliance.
It is considered absolutely vital for reaching the Paris agreement target of keeping global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times.
Under it, developed countries will also provide enhanced funding support estimated at billions of dollars globally.
## Challenges:
Financial support is required to produce and store refrigerants namely HCFCs.
Alternative technology which does not produce HFCs.
Requires R&D to develop new technologies (need funding for research)
Technology transfer from developed countries slow
Expensive new technologies lead to a burden to consumers.
Noise Pollution (3.44 PM)
Noise is undesirable or unwanted sound.
Sound is measured in the Decibel unit.
According to WHO, any sound above 45 decibels in the daytime and above 35 decibels in the nighttime is considered as noise.
## Sources:
Busy marketplace, railway stations, bus depots, airports, traffic congestion, religious ceremonies, loudspeakers, machinery in factories etc.
Impacts: Hearing impairment, deafness, irritation, hypertension, lack of sleep etc.
Solutions: Declaration of ‚Äúsilent zone‚Äù.
Noise reduction devices/ Noise attenuation/ noise barriers, noise mounds etc.
Retrofitting of vehicles
Maintenance of railway tracks
Continuous maintenance and removal of wear and tear of instruments/machinery
Green Mufflers (planting of trees like a green belt)

The topic for the next class: Water Pollution, Land Pollution etc.
