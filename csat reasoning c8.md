![[Pasted image 20211222054906.png]] ^e0a8b2

or when the **larger figure** is a square
	just take square of all the mini squares in the figure
		1 sq + 2 sq+ 3 sq = 1+4+9 = 14

when the largers figure is as  rectangle
		note - here rows are reduced only till 2 since that is when we hit the column's value as 1 #doubt
