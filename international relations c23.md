india - japan relations - 09.20 am

## phases
[[1947]]-79 
initially started with warmth at people to people level due to foll reasons -
1. japan's support to [[sc bose]]'s ina.
2. india gifting baby elephants to japan after hiroshima & nagasaki bombings.
3. emphasis on asian solidarity. 
 
while govt to govt relations remain tepid due to
1. cold war politics 
2. inward-looking economy of india led to not having very close ties. 
[[1974]] - india undertook its 1st nuclear test in [[1974]] & given japan's sensitivities to nuclear weapons, relations deteriorated further. 
[[1985]]-[[2000]] -
rajiv gandhi became 1st indian pm to address japanese DIET (parliament) & vision that he articulated during visit continues to be guiding light for india's foreign policy vis-a-vis japan. 
he suggested that india's relationship with japan would not be limited to trade & investment rather both need to rediscover each other in their hearts. 
however, nothing much changed on ground. in fact, in [[1998]], foll [[operation shakti]] & india became a de facto nuclear weapon state, once again tough economic & technological sanctions were imposed on india by world & by japan particularly. 
[[2000]] onwards -
this marks cherry blossom phase in relations of india & japan. since then bilateral relations have flourished & there is no looking back.

## factors that have led to india - japan convergence -
09.46 am
following economic reforms & india adopting new economic policies (export-led growth strategy), indian economy became very attractive. gdp registered strong growth & size of indian market attracted countries from all over world. 
improvement in india-us relations. ([[youtube abhijit chavda]] --> [[japan]] as usa colony)
rise of china & role of india as a balancing power. 
apart from above factors, absence of any historical baggage or any major strategic disagreement. 
complementarities in terms of economies & therefore seem as natural ties. 
1. japan has surplus capital while india needs investments.
2. japan has ageing population while india represents young demography.
3. japan is a technology superpower with india offering huge markets or large markets to aid japan to sustain its present quality of life. 
4. both have territorial disputes with china - india on its northern powers while japan & china dispute senkaku or diaoyu island in east china sea. 
5. both india & japan have stakes in a stable rule-based indo-pacific for trade & energy security which is once again threatened by china. 
india & japan have entered into specified skill-workers agreement. this agreement covers 14 categories of specified skills such as nursing, industrial machinery manufacturing, fisheries, agriculture etc. under which skill workers from india would be eligible for employment in japan on a contractual basis. candidates would have to meet skill requirement & pass japanese language test. 
ssw - specified skill workers is new category of residence created by japan under which skilled indian nationals can work & stay in japan. 
70 years since diplomatic relations were established b/w india & japan, they have evolved into natural partners. 
1. in 2006, 2 launched a global partnership which has been expanded into sp strategic & global partnerships. 
2. in 2017, 2 countries have signed agreement on cooperation vis-a-vis peaceful use of nuclear energy.

1. india is 1 of biggest recipients of japan's oda (overseas development assistance). in fact, delhi metro is ex of such cooperation. 
2. japan's support vis a vis india's mega infrastructure projects such as delhi mumbai freight corridor, delhi-mumbai industrial corridor, chennai- bangalore industrial corridor, ahmedabad -mumbai high-speed rail system. 
3. india has decided to introduce shinkansen high-speed rail system of japan in india which is known for its high accuracy & safety. 
4. japan is only country allowed to extend infrastructure development in india's sensitive north-eastern region & andaman & nicobar islands. 
outside india -
1. asia - africa growth corridor.
2. infrastructure development in 3rd countries like afghanistan, sri lanka, bangladesh etc. 

## defence cooperation -
1. quad security dialogue - restarted in 2017 & held its first-ever leaders' summit in march 2021. 
2. expansion of malabar exercise.
3. agreement on transfer of defence equipment & technology 2018 - it's uncommon agreement for japan to sign. under it, cooperative research work is being done on unmanned ground vehicles & robotics. 
4. acquisition & cross-servicing agreement - it was finalised in 2020 & through it, india & japan will have access to each others' military bases for cross-servicing requirements. 

global partnership - global partnership of india & japan. they have common global goals vis-a-vis reforms in unsc, disaster risk management, climate change & terrorism, de-nuclearisation of korean peninsula. 
1. india's concern with respect to nuclear proliferation in north korea is that it transferred **nodong ballistic missiles** (not spelling error !) to pakistan which it has modified to develop nuclear-capable chauri system. 
2. india & japan along with australia have launched a supply chain resilience initiative- as a collaborative mechanism to enable resilient, diversified & trustworthy supply chains, ensuring a reliable supply of critical materials & technology & developing new partnerships in manufacturing & skill development.

## areas of weakness -
10.30 am
decline in bilateral trade despite concluding cepa. 
india's sudden announcement of its decision to opt-out of rcep (regional comprehensive economic partnership) agreement when japan expected to cooperate with india against china's aggressive economic agenda.
defence trade is continued to be a thorn in relations - japan would like greater interest of india with respect to us 2 amphibious aircraft built by japan while india was recently disappointed when japan did not bid for india's submarine contract whereas it was interested in japan's soryu class submarines. 

break - 10.39 am
10.49 am
## why india & japan are considered pivotal to rule-based indo-pacific -
10.50 am
indo-pacific comprises indian ocean & pacific ocean. it starts from eastern coast of africa up to western coast of usa.
china is primary threat to rule-based order of indo-pacific whereby it's taking several infrastructure projects in indian ocean such as deep-sea port development, acquiring strategic ports in debt for equity swap under its bri initiative, leased out strategic islands of maldives. also in south china sea, it has laid down contesting claims, hypothesized 9 dash lines, reclaiming artificial islands & militarizing them. 
against muscular & aggressive china in region, india & japan are considered pivotal to a stable rules-based order in region. 
why? 
they are pivotal b/c they have capability as well as intention to counter aggressive china in region. both are democracies are hence support rule of law & are also capable of cooperating with 1 another. 
economic capabilities -
india is third-largest economy in ppp terms while japan is second-largest economy in gdp terms in asia. 
defence capability -
india has 1 of largest militaries in world; it's a de-facto nuclear weapon state while japan is a defence technology powerhouse. also, previous constitutional limitations that were placed on msdf have been slowly & steadily removed under former pm shinzo abe, allowing it to participate in joint military exercises etc. 
intention - 
1. rule-based indo-pacific, freedom of navigation in region is vital for their trade & energy securities. if freedom of navigation were to be compromised in region, their economy would be irreparably damaged. 
2. both have territorial disputes with china & would seek to counter its expansionist policy to ensure their territorial integrity. 
apart from capability & intention at individual levels, these 2 are like-minded countries (liberal democracies) without any historical baggage or major strategic disagreement. thus, they are capable of cooperating with 1 another with respect to their common enemy which is aggressive & muscular china. 
also, these 2 countries are cooperating with other countries such as australia, usa to counter china in region through initiatives such as quad, supply chain resilience initiative, core (competitiveness & resilience partnership). 
their efforts to rules-based indo-pacific would be augmented through new initiatives such as aukus (us, uk, australia) with respect to supply of nuclear-capable submarines to australia to ensure better power in region.
core - competitiveness & resilience partnership
it's a partnership b/w us & japan to invest in emerging technologies to close gap vis-a-vis mammoth investment of 1.4 trillion dollars announced by china in emerging technologies. 
## jai - japan america india trilateral
this 1st summit took place in december 2018 in buenos aires of argentina on sidelines of g20 summit. 
2nd summit was in june 2019 in osaka, japan on sidelines of g20 summit. 
aim is to build regional architecture in indo-pacific regions. india stresses that this new framework should be inclusive b/c - 
- to ensure countries of region against china's contention that indo-pacific is exclusive club. 
- pm modi has come out with five action points 
1. connectivity 
2. sustainable development 
3. disaster management/relief
4. maritime security 
5. freedom of navigation 
## importance of jai - 
- to ensure rule-based indo-pacific 
- to counter aggressive china 

## india - russia relations -
11.25 am
official status of bilateral relations -

in [[1971]], india- russia peace & friendship treaty was signed. india came under security umbrella of ussr. 
in [[2000]], russia was 1st country with which india signed a strategic partnership agreement. also, india started annual summits with russia. 
from 2010, relations have been elevated to sp strategic & privileged relations. 
india recognises russia as time-tested partner. russia has stood by india across ups & lows.

## areas of cooperation -
11.34 am
defence technology - it's 1 of highly influential aspects of india russia relations. it rests on apart from export of equipment, technology transfer, joint development & joint marketing.
though technology transfer or joint development have become a part of india's defence relations with several countries, no country is as willing as russia to share high technologies with india. brahmos missile system is 1 such ex. 
acc to due importance to india-russia relations, india despite threats of sanctions under usa's caatsa, purchased s400 triumf missile system. 
importance of closeness of india-russia defence relations is apparent from fact that russia is only country that leases india its nuclear attack submarines. russia is also only country that is willing to provide crucial technologies for building india's own nuclear missile submarines. 
space technology - former soviet union launched india's 1st 2 satellites (aryabhatta & bhaskara).
russia has provided us with cryogenic technologies which will aid indian mission to space to carry heavy payloads. 
civil nuclear energy - kodankulam nuclear power plant is biggest nuclear power plant, it's india-russia initiative. 

## areas of weaknesses/challenges in relations -
11.44 am
economic/trade relations - in cold war era, former ussr was india's largest trading partner. however, since [[1991]], us, china, saudi arabia have emerged as primary trade partners of india.
evidence - 
1. annual bilateral trade on average stands at 10 billion dollars; india's lowest trade with any p5 country. 
2. they do not figure in each other's top 15 trading partners' lists. 
3. they account for a meagre 1 per cent of each others' total trade volumes.

## reasons for weak economic links -
1. distance & connectivity hurdles - transport of goods from china & europe to russia is accomplished in 7-10 days while it takes 40 odd days for exchange of goods b/w india & russia.
2. weak banking links
3. bureaucratic hurdles in both countries 
4. russia's restrictive visa regime.
## solutions -
connectivity - 
1. overseas connectivity projects such as instc corridor
2. chennai vladivostok sea link provide alternative route to connect india to russia's far east. it covers 5600 nautical miles & distance can be covered in 10-12 days by a larger container ship cruising at normal speed of 20-25 knots. it will also increase india's presence in indo-pacific, esp in south china sea which beijing considers its stomping ground. 
- this sea route is from vladivostok southward on sea of japan past korean peninsula covering taiwan & philippines in south china sea, passed singapore through strait of malacca to emerge into bay of bengal & then to cut across andaman & nicobar archipelago to chennai. 
- *vladivostok is largest port on russia's pacific coast* at a short distance from russia-china border. 
india should negotiate a free trade agreement b/w india & russia's eurasian economic union. 
promote private sector investment & develop banking links. 
presently, balance of trade is in russia's favour since defence & high technology dominates trade basket. russian markets should open up to indian pharmaceuticals, it sector, health, etc. 
diamond trade can be area of cooperation b/w russia & india. 
however, india-russia trade relations have got further complicated b/c of ongoing russia-ukraine war. west has imposed crippling sanctions on russian economy, discouraging any trade relations with russia. 
people to people ties - in era of ict powered globalisation, no bilateral relations can flourish in long run by restricting it at mere govt to govt level. 

topics to be covered in next class - russia ukraine crisis, india-us, india-china relations.
