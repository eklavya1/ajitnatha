in a joint team of scientists from defence research & development organisation (drdo) & indian institute of technology (iit) delhi successfully demonstrated quantum key distribution (qkd) link b/w prayagraj & vindhyachal in uttar pradesh, a distance of more than 100 kilometres.

it's primarily a mechanism to undertake secure communication which utilises a cryptographic protocol involving various components of quantum mechanics.
technology enables 2 communicating sides to come up with random secret keys shared by both of them & known exclusively to them, so only they can use it to encrypt & 
decrypt messages, thus achieving a very highly-secure communication.
this technological breakthrough was achieved over a commercial-grade optical fibre already available in field.
with this success, country has demonstrated indigenous technology of secure key transfer for bootstrapping military-grade communication security key hierarchy.
performance parameters have been measured & have been found to be repetitively within reported international standards at sifted key rates of up to 10 khz.
this technology will enable security agencies to plan a suitable quantum communication network with indigenous technology backbone.
