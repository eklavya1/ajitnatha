pakistan & myanmar are not a member.
three distinguishing features -
it's ex of open regionalism & soft regionalism.
benefits of trade liberalization will not be limited to member countries but will be extended to non-member states as well.
open regionalism is a stepping stone.
soft regionalism - it's based on legal agreements enforceable treaties & agreed norms.
these organizations are not strictly structured.
opposite of soft regionalism is hard regionalism.
most of regional organizations are exs of hard regionalism.
for ex, eu, saarc, etc.
soft regionalism has been a tendency in asian countries or post-colonial states.
tripartite in nature - it brings together representatives of govt, business, & academia for promoting cooperation & a closer interaction.
decisions are taken by consensus.
commitments are made on a voluntary basis.
all these 3 features are shared by epec too.
objective -
initially, aim was regional economic cooperation however, under india's chairmanship in 2012-2013 goal of iora was expanded to 6 priority areas.
maritime safety & security.
trade & investment facilitation.
fisheries management.
disaster risk management.
academia & science & technology.
tourism & cultural exchange.
in addition to these 6 areas, iora has identified 2 cross-cutting themes - blue economy & gender empowerment.
in 2017, indonesia organized iora leaders summit for 1st time.
it organized a meeting of leaders of member countries which led to signing of iora concord also k/a jakarta concord.
it's largely aspirational statement.
it was accompanied by iora action plan which set concrete short, medium, & long-term goals across 6 priority areas.
challenges -
regional economic diversity - member countries at extremely varied levels of economic development such as australia on 1 hand & madagascar & somalia on other makes it difficult to come out with common economic goals.
wide prevalence of non-conventional security threats - absence of a common regional maritime security structure prevents member countries from effectively dealing with such threats.
rise of china/revisionist china - it results in increasing presence of extra-territorial powers resulting in increased volatility of region.
absence of countries' deep pockets like china - to allow bridging of infrastructure, lag, or deficit in region.
few countries such as myanmar etc who are littoral countries of indian ocean are not member countries of iora.
despite immense potential  b/c of widespread prevalence of challenges indian ocean region countries are not able to benefit from it.
therefore it's necessary to overcome these challenges.
wayforward - 
establish a maritime security structure.
there exists opportunity for multilateral security cooperation.
countries like india & indonesia have to demonstrate leadership of organization.
in absence of deep pockets of member countries, investments can be sought from like-minded countries like japan in region. it might encourage private investments.
steps to limited foreign interference.
opportunities for iora -
establishing a security framework against non-conventional threats.
increase regional security cooperation b/w member countries to check destabilizing impact of right of revisionist china.

saarc (11:22 am)
saarc (11:22 am)

lesson plan - need for regional cooperation.
origin of saarc.
3 principles of saarc.
achievements.
failures.
wayforward.
need for regional cooperation -
in general - to promote economic prosperity & ensure regional peace.
there is rise of threats or global challenges - climate change.
in recent times - rise of transnational criminal networks.
rise of non-state actors.
in south asia - this region suffers from severe poverty.
it faces transnational & security threats like human trafficking.
a natural disaster has become more common.
origin of saarc 
estabslihed in 1985.
brainchild of former president/pm of bangladesh zia-ur-rehman.
8 members -afghanistan, pakistan, india, bangladesh, maldives, bhutan, nepal, & sri lanka.
aim - regional economic welfare.
principles - 
principle of non-interference in domestic affairs.
they could take up only regional issues for discussion.
all decisions will be taken on basis of consensus.
achievements of saarc -
saarc university in delhi.
saarc disaster management center in gujarat.
saarc satellite established.
saarc food bank.
incidences of failure -
irregular summits.
least integrated in terms of trade- only 5% of trade v/s 65% in case of eu.
intraregional investments less than 1% v/s 18% in asean.
incorporation of safta to achieve goal of zero tariffs by 2016 is still not achieved.
saarc treaty of investment in 2007, not yet signed.
reasons for failure- 
size asymmetry- india is biggest country with a 70% population & largest military.
any step by india creates mistrust.
india-pakistan rivalry - 2 biggest nations of south asia, consistent rivalry has slowed down progress of south asia.
all indian initiates face hurdles by islamabad.
reverse regionalism & reductive nationalism.
cold war politics.
economies are supplementary, not complementary.
pangs of proximity.
a consequence of these failures - give a push to sub regionalism.
for ex, bbin, south asian sub-regional economic cooperation forum, bimstec.
wayforward 
is saarc - pakistan option? - no,  b/c pakistan is inadvertent part of south asia.
saarc + china - china demanded membership of saarc supported by pakistan.
china is not a south asian nation, & if china joins, india won't be much important.
but now china has created china south asia cooperation forum & is no more interested in saarc, india is a member but bhutan is not.
myanmar & vietnam have been made a member therefore csacf cannot be termed as alternative to saarc.
also, this is a very recent organization formed in 2018.
