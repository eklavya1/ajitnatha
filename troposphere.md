- it is the lowest portion of earth's atmosphere and contains approx 80% of atmosphere's mass & of its water vapour & aerosols.
- characteristic features of  troposphere is its great [[density]].
- in addition to [[nitrogen]] & [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and water vapour (nearly all of the water vapour contained in the atmosphere is concentrated in troposphere) & numerous particles of various origin.
- thickness of troposphere is maximum at equator, deeper in tropics, up to 20 km, & shallower near  polar regions, at 7 km in summer, & indistinct in winter.
## chemical composition
- chemical composition of the troposphere is essentially uniform.
- amount of water vapour decreases strongly with altitude.
## temperature
- temperature of troposphere decreases with height.
- rate at which temperature decreases is called the environmental [[lapse rate]] (elr). it is about 0.60 degree celcius / 100 meters.
- temperature decreases at a nearly uniform rate with increased altitude.

## tropopause
- the boundary between troposphere & stratosphere, called tropopause, is a temperature inversion.
- tropopause refers to [[altitude]] at which the fall in temperature is stalled.

- its average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator.
- *thickness of troposphere & consequently atmosphere is greatest at equator* because heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.
- contains dust particles & water vapor.
- [[temperature]] in this layer decreases at rate of ioc for every 165m of height.
- most important layer for all biological activity.

- [ ] its average height is 13 km.
- [x] the air we breathe exists here.
- [x] almost all the weather phenomena like rainfall, fog, and hailstorms occur in this layer.
