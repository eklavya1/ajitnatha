as govt sets to achieve its agenda of a malnutrition-free [[india]] & doubling farmers income, it has shifted its policy to promotion of **nutria-rich** cereals 1 of which is millets.
before [[green revolution]], millets made up around 40 per cent of all cultivated grains (contributing more than [[wheat]] & [[rice]]). however, since revolution, [[production]] of rice has increased doubly & wheat production has tripled.

## some important points regarding millets:
due to its high resistance against harsh conditions, millets are sustainable to [[environment]], to [[farmer]] growing it, & provide cheap & 
high nutrient options for all.
nearly 40 per cent of [[food]] produced in [[india]] is wasted every year. millets do not get destroyed easily, & some of millets are good for [[consumption]] even after 10-12 years of growing, thus providing food security, & playing important role in keeping a check on food wastage.
millet is fibrous in content, has [[magnesium]], niacin (vitamin b3), is gluten-free, & has a high [[protein]] content.
millets are less expensive & nutritionally superior to wheat & rice owing to their high protein fibre, vitamins, & minerals like iron 
content & can provide nutritional security.
it's a collective term referring to a number of small-seeded annual grasses that are cultivated as grain crops in dry areas in temperate, subtropical, & tropical regions.
india's proposal to observe intemational year of millet's in 2023 has been approved by food & agriculture organisation (fao).
india celebrated 2018 as national year of millets.

millets are collective of a number of diff small-grained cereal grasses.
based on their sizes, 2 main groups of millets are:

- major millets - sorghum (jowar) & pearl millet (bajra)
- small millets - represented by six species, namely finger millet (ragi), little millet, kodo millet, foxtail millet, barnyard millet & proso millet, representing area grown in that order. 

- of late, classification is also indication of area under these crops. millets are widely used in african & asian countries. majorly cultivated in semi-arid tropical regions of africa & asia, around 97 per cent of world’s overall millet production happens in these regions.
- **india is world's largest millets producer.**
- govt decided to declare year 2018 as “national year of millets" to boost production of nutrient-rich millets & sunrise agri industry (an emerging industry with bright growth potential) involved in it.
- govt announces minimum support prices (msps) for millets like sorghum (jowar), pearl millet (bajra) & finger millet (ragi).
