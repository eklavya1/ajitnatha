# summary	

geography class 31

ocean current

    it's general movement of surface water of ocean in a definite direction over long distances.
    there are 2 types of oceanic currents:
    warm oceanic current & cold oceanic current
    warm currents (wc) move from low latitude to high latitude
    cold currents (cc) move from high latitude to low latitude

factors influencing ocean current

    wind: sturdy blowing of winds drag surface water in its direction & brings about surface flow & steadily sets water current in motion.
    variations in temperature, pressure, salinity or density cause water to move in particular directions & reduce variations.
    such differences guide movement of oceanic currents.
    coriolis force: it causes oceanic currents to deflect right in northern hemisphere & to left in southern hemisphere
    shape of continent & coastlines modify directions of oceanic currents.

north atlantic ocean (nao)

    along equatorial, 3 currents were formed. 
    these 3 current are:
    north equatorial current (nec) & south equatorial current (sec), equatorial counter current (ecc)
    along brazil coast, nec & part of sec flow upward as warm current (wc) along caribbean islands.
    caribbean islands divide this wc into 2 branches (east & west of caribbean islands)
    antilles' current forms along east coast of caribbean islands.
    it rejoins with western branch & makes florida current (wc).
    florida current further transitions to gulf stream (gs).
    gs (wc) beyond newfoundland comes in contact with westerlies.
    this combined with coriolis force results in deflecting of gs from west to east.
    this helps in formation of north atlantic drift (nad).
    nad (wc) is divided into 2 branches along western european coast.
    north nad  is known by name of irminger current (wc). 
    south nad is known by name of canary current (cc).
    thus circulatory clockwise oceanic pattern is completed leading to formation of gyre.
    in nao, continuous circulation of water in a clockwise direction results in stagnant & slow-moving water within.
    seaweed sargasso is grown in this stagnant water.
    2 cold currents are found on east & west coast of greenland.
    polar cold current labrador joins gulf stream (wc) near newfoundland.
    note: meeting of cc & wc leads to dense fog as it leads to dropping of temperature which disrupts transportation & navigation.

south atlantic ocean current (saoc)

    sec after hitting brazilian coast flows downward along south american coast as brazilian current (wc).
    this comes in contact with westerlies & joins west wind drift (wwd).
    coriolis force & planetary wind help in deflecting ocean current towards western african coast
    this makes cold benguela current along western african coast.
    thus a gyre is formed in sao also.
    cold currents (on western coast of continents) lead to deserts.
    exs of such deserts:
    sahara desert (reason: canary current)
    namib desert ( reason: benguela current)
    reason for desertification due to cc:
    lack of convection due to low temperature

north pacific ocean current (npoc)

    near equator: 3 currents are found. these are nec, sec, ecc.
    nec forms warm kuroshio current which in turn transitions to north pacific drift (npd)
    reason for npd:
    coriolis force & planetary wind.
    this  north pacific drift hits west coast of usa.
    this results in 2 currents, alaska current, & californian current.
    alaska current (moving up) is warm current warm.
    cold californian current moves downwards leading to deserts on western coast of usa.
    thus, continuous circulation of water is observed & a gyre is formed in npo also.
    along sakhalin island & kamchatka peninsula, 2 cold current flows.
    these are: okhotsk & oyashio (both are cc)
    oyashio cold current joins kuroshio warm current & hence rich fishing ground is found in these regions.

south pacific ocean current (spoc)

    sec on hitting land makes east australian current (warm current).
    later this warm current joins west wind drift.
    due to coriolis force & planetary wind, deflection of this warm ocean current results in south pacific drift (spd)
    spd moves up & formed a cold humboldt current along peruvian coast (also c/a peruvian current)
    thus, continuous circulation of water is observed & a gyre is formed in spo also.

south indian ocean current

    near equator: 3 currents are found. these are nec, sec, ecc.
    sec flows along coastline of africa & splits into 2 branches
    1 branch flows b/w madagascar & mozambique & is know as mozambique warm current flows
    mozambique warm current after merging with other branch forms warm agulhas current
    this (warm agulhas current) further joins westwind drift & some part of it deviated north & rest of it flows as westwinddrift.
    deviated northern branch is west australian current & forms a circulatory gyre in south indian ocean.

north indian ocean current

    in winters :
    north equatorial current (nec) flows westward above equator.
    equatorial counter-current flows b/w nec & south equatorial current (sec)
    ne monsoon from land drives waters of bob & arabian sea to circulate in anticlockwise direction (c/a ne monsoon drift)
    in summers:
    entire water of northern indian ocean comes under influence of sw monsoon producing a clockwise flow of sw monsoon drift.
    during this time, there is no north equatorial current as well as no counter equatorial current
    reason for this: disruption caused by strong sw monsoon wind
    note: in north indian ocean, there is no gyre.

significance of ocean currents

    cold current along western coast in subtropical regions suppresses precipitation leading to formation of deserts.
    exs of such deserts
    namib desert (reason: benguela current).
    atacama desert ( reason: peruvian current).
    east coast in subtropics under influence of warm ocean current receive more rainfall & more cyclonic disturbance eg: florida coast.
    west coast along temperate regions experience mild winters & ice-free ports or coast due to warm ocean currents eg made.
    meeting of warm & cold ocean currents leads to ideal conditions for growth of fish, resulting in formation of fishing banks
    exs of such fishing ground:
    meeting of gulf stream & labrador current near newfoundland island.
    meeting of warm & cold ocean current result in fog formation which might obstruct ocean navigation
    ex of this: titanic submergence
    ocean currents can be used in navigation.
    it helps in global distribution of temperature & salinity.
    circulation of oceanic currents results in formation of gyres across diff oceans.
    cold oceanic currents are zones of upwelling which helps in fish growth.

upwelling & downwelling

    upwelling:
    offshore winds push surface away & cause cold water from bottom to rise up on surface.
    this brings cold & deep nutrient-rich waters to surface which helps in growth of fish.
    upwelling is more active in regions of cold current
    downwelling :
    onshore wind pile up water near to coast causing sinking of water below surface layer.
    upwelling is active in cold current
    downwelling is more active in regions where warm & cold ocean current meets.

thermohaline circulation

    these are large-scale ocean circulation, covering 90 % of oceanic water.
    major reason:  difference in salinity & temperature

next class: thermohaline circulation; water mass; el nino & la nina
