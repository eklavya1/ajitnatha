- • The Vikas (VIKram Ambalal Sarabhai) is a family of [[liquid-fuelled rocket engine]]s conceptualized and designed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre in the 1970s. The [[design]] was based on the licensed version of the Viking engine with the chemical pressurization system. 
 - • Vikas engine is used to power the second stage of PSLV, boosters and second stage of GSLV Mark I and II and also the core stage of GSLV Mark III.
 • The Indian Space Research Organization had successfully conducted a ground test of its high thrust version of the Vikas Engine. High Thrust Vikas Engine will improve the payload capability of PSLV, GSLV and GSLV Mk-III launch vehicles.
 - • Indian Space Research [[Organisation]] (ISRO) scientist Nambi Narayanan was one of the key proponents of liquid propulsion [[technology]] for rockets in early days of ISRO. He was one of the scientists behind the [[development]] of the Vikas’ engine which has been installed at the heart of rockets launched by India and was also part of key missions like Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan.
