Tropical evergreen forests are well stratified, with layers closer to the ground and are covered with shrubs and creepers, with short structured trees followed by a tall variety of trees.
In these forests, trees reach great heights up to 60 m or above.
There is no definite time for trees to shed their leaves, flower and fruition.
As such these forests appear green all year-round.
Species found in these forests include rosewood, Mahogony, Aini, Ebony, etc.
