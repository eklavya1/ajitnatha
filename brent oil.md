Brent Crude may refer to any or all of the components of the Brent Complex, a physically & financially traded oil [[market]] based around the North Sea of Northwest Europe; colloquially, Brent Crude usually refers to the price of the ICE Brent Crude Oil futures contract or the contract itself. The original Brent Crude referred to a trading classification of sweet light crude oil first extracted from the Brent oilfield in the North Sea in 1976. As production from the Brent oilfield declined over time, crude oil blends from other oil fields have been added to the trade classification. The current Brent blend consists of crude oil produced from the Brent, Forties (added 2002), Oseberg (added 2002), Ekofisk (added 2007), & Troll (added 2018) oil fields (also known as the BFOET Quotation).The Brent Crude oil marker is also known as Brent Blend, London Brent & Brent [[petroleum]]. This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, & sweet because of its low sulphur content.

Brent is the leading global price benchmark for Atlantic basin crude oils. It is used to set the price of two-thirds of the world's internationally traded crude oil supplies. It is one of the two main benchmark prices for purchases of oil worldwide, the other being West Texas Intermediate (WTI).
