World History Class 05

Unification of Italy(01:00 PM)

1830, 1848: Italians fought for unification, democracy, and anti-colonialism but failed.
Mazzini was the heart of Italian unification that is generated nationalism.
1830-1831 set up young Italy as an organization and it participated and led people in 1830, 1848.
The main role was of the kingdom of Sardinia and its prime minister or minister-president Cavor(like Prussia, Bismarck)
He followed a similar policy to that of the policy of Bismarck.
By 1859-60, CAvor/Sardinia gave some territory to France in return for war against Austria and took over North Italy from Austria.
This is also proof of the failure of the Congress of Vienna or the Concert of Europe.
Garibaldi was a member of Young Italy and a revolutionary and his private army/followers were called Redshirts also known as the sword of Italian unification(IU).
In 1860, Gribaldi and his red shirts with support kingdom of Sardinia attacked the kingdom of two Sicilies that is Sicily and Naples under the Bourbon dynasty and they were merged with the kingdom of Sardinia to set up the kingdom of Italy 1860.
Similarities and differences between the unification of Italy and Germany.
Background: Post 1815 in both cases Venetia and the rest of North Italy came under Austria, therefore, unification meant independence from Austria and uniting different kingdoms into a single Italy
Difference: In the case of Germany there was no foreign power as such.
There was no confusion or what would be the territory of a united Italy due to geographical regions and united Italy would have a geographical border because the Alps are in the North and seas on the east-west and south.
In the case of Germany, there was confusion about whether to include the Austrian territory in Germany.
Similarity: Congress of Vienna, 1815 did not unite Italy because Austria wanted North Italy. Germany was also not united.
In both scenarios 1830 & 1848 revolts by the people failed to achieve unification and democracy.
Differences: In the case of the unification of Italy there was an important role played by revolutionaries. Examples are Mazzini set up young Italy in 1830 with the goal of removal of Austria from north Italy, Unification, and a republic.
However, there was no prominent revolutionary in the German Unification.
Similarity: the Kingdom of Sardinia and its minister President Cavour played the lead role in unification with policies of similar to Prussia or Bismarck’s.
France and Sardinia vs. Austria: Sardinia gave some territory to France for support for the war against Austria.
Difference: Prussia was stronger than Sardinia and was less dependent on the allied forces. As a result of the war, the part of North Italy was annexed by Sardinia, and Austria was removed from North Italy except for the Venetia.
Revolutionary: Garibaldi with red shirts (Supporters) and assistance from the Sardinia overthrew the Bourbon dynasty from Sicily and Naples.
Result: the Kingdom of Italy was established under the king of Sardinia.
Papal state and Venetia remain to be united.
In 1866 Italy and Prussia fought the war with Austria and Venetia merged into Italy.
Franco Russian War, 1870: As France was busy in war and getting defeated.
France was the military protector of the Papal state which was the kingdom of the Church and pope as ruler. The papal state was dependent on France for protection and an army.
Italy made use of the opportunity and annexed the papal state as France could not come to add to the Papal state. Rome was made the capital of united Italy.
Church refuses to recognize the kingdom of Italy as legitimate.
Post-1870 Italy began industrialization

Industrial Revolution(IR)(01:34 PM)

It was characterized by a change in the processes of production led by a series of Innovations and their spread.
The industrial revolution was  involved towards
Mechanized production.
Certain new sources of power were introduced.
There were technological developments in transport and communication.
Why IR was a revolution?
IR took 100 years to materialize and is not being called a Revolution
Revolution - Huge change in a short span of time.
It is still a revolution because of huge socio-political and economic impacts not just on Britain but the rest of the world as well.
Why First in England and how IR in other countries was different?
In Britain  1750s and 1850s and the rest of the world, it was mainly posted 1870s. for example US post-1865 and in the case of Japan it was post-1868 and in the case of Russia it was post-1929 and the rest of Europe pst the 1870s.
Why 1st in England?
The right conditions existed simultaneously first in England and therefore IR happened first in England
When most of these conditions co-existed in other countries they also industrialized.
Conditions :
There was a culture of the quest for new ideas because of the renaissance spirit.
It implied an era in Europe post-1300s that focused on the welfare of humans i.e Humanism by finding solutions to different problems in all spheres of life by using logic and reason.
Rennaisance in the economy led to capitalism similar;y renaissance in politics led to enlightenment.
Renaissance in Science and technology led to the scientific revolution and in society, it led to the end of feudalism.
There was the availability of capitalism for the spread of and for the spread of innovations across the economy.
Capital accumulation and capitalism flourish the British trade.
Security of property because of democracy ie no deprivation of property unless provided by law (Right to property)
Role of  Geography
The existence of good natural harbors boosted the oceanic trade
It was an island therefore immune to foreign invasions that provided a peace that is conducive or which is good for the economy.
Navigable inland water tributaries and provide better connectivity for the movement of goods, Boosted interlinkages in the economy.
The abundance of Iron (machines) and coal ( steam-power) were important for IR.
Democracy in England
English civil war(1642)
Church and king supported
It was fought between parliamentarians vs King plus Catholics.
Dispute - Church, and King supported the divine right ok king to rule.
Parliamentarians - argued that king can not rule without the consent of Parliament (Ruler = King + king can not rule without the consent of Parliament )
Bloody civil war: King Charles 1 was executed.
Result: The principle established that the king controls the consent of Parliament.
Industrial revolution: It began in the textile sector.
EIC (East India Company )had a monopoly over trade with India. Until 1813 EIC was earning huge profits by selling India-finished cotton in Britain.
This led to envy amongst the nin EIC businesses who now searched for ways to convert raw cotton into finished cotton clothes domestically to have a share in the booming cotton market of Britain.
This led to a series of innovations beginning with the development of machines for the textile sector.
Process of Industrial Revolution (PISTA )
Faster spinning Machines by Hargreaves, Arkwright, and Crompton
Faster Looms - Cartwright developed a power loom that ran on Horsepower later modified to run on Hydropower and then on steam Power.
Cotton Gin is developed by Eli Whitney that separated Fibre 300 times faster than by Hand
Steam: 1769 James Watt developed the Steam engine, which was now adapted to power different machines which were running on hydropower.
The steam engine was utilized for faster removal of water from mines and this boosted coals and other mineral production.
Iron innovation of Blast furnace led to the production of cheap IR and this made machines.
Transport sector:
Railways
George Stephenson in 1814 Deployed steam engines to railways. therefore this led to faster movement of goods and people in the economy example ports, factories, and Raw materials

Impact of IR(02:52 PM)

It boosted demand for steel domestic sources of Raw materials.
Imports for Raw material, exports of Finished goods.
Roads
A pneumatic tyre is invented and macadamized roads (Pakka roads) by Mcadam which led to faster movement of goods and people
Canals - Man-made canal network was developed.
Overall - A multimodal network got established which interlinked the economy efficiently.
The steam engine was deployed in ships which boosted oceanic trade i.e Fater extraction of raw materials from colonies and rapid capture of export markets and the steam engine deployed in the boast that boosted inland connectivity.
Agriculture
Enclosure movement - big landlords connived with landlords and passed such laws that allowed the easier land acquisition of lands or of small farmers by big landlords.
This led to rising of landlessness and now these people or these peasants moved from rural areas to work in factories in urban areas.
The development of a machine for the agriculture sector reduced the requirement of far labor since it provided labor for factories and it boosted food production of cash crops on surplus land. Therefore factories got a greater supply of cash crops
It provided labor for the factory techniques like crop rotation and manuring fertilizers boosted food production.
Post-development of telegram will boost communication which helped businesses.
How IR in England was different? Who provided the capital?
Britain's capital was provided by private players and the rest of the countries Governments incentivized private players with subsidies.
Because of the lack of flourishing of private sector
Innovation:
Britain innovation took time vs rest either imported the machines or engaged in espionage (illegal sourcing of technology)
Prominent sectors:
Britain, textile, steel, coal, railways, shipping, steam engine, etc.
Rest: Steel coal railways shipping banking sector giving loans to private oil gas, chemical synthesis, the internal combustion engine
Third Industrial revolution (1970+)
Civil nuclear energy
Automation of machines via Programming
Rise of electronics, computers, telecommunication
Robots
Internet and related implication
Impact on Britain
Britain developed from an Agrarian economy to an Industrialized economy of the world.
Its GDP expanded rapidly making it the top economy with the rest far behind.
From importer of finished goods to an exporter of finished goods, I.e imports from Ram materials boosted.
Steel production, coal production got boosted.
Britain became an undisputed world power.
Impact on Britain people
Capitalist /middle class benefitted the most (Bourgiosia)
Now industrial capitalists replaced agrarian landlords as the most economically powerful section.
Mass migration from rural areas to urban areas as landless peasants became workers in factories.
Change in the structure of occupation for masses earlier peasants now workers.
Urban city infrastructure got overburdened (housing shortage)
The rise in inequality led to poor labor living in slums with poor hygiene, diseases became rampant
The workers have ranged from 16-20 hours a day, no sickness allowance, no accident insurance, no restriction on child labor minimum wages, no job security.
This was of laissez-faire (implied free market economy where the government should have no role in the market and everything is determined by forces of demand & supply
The oppression of workers was the product of IR. Karl Marx gave his philosophy of marxism/communism after observing the conditions of workers therefore there was the rise of socialism/communism as a response to the negatives of Industrial Capitalism.
Impact of oppression of workers - Workers began their class movements (working-class movements).
Factories acts were brought (the 1800s) to improve working conditions eg Restrictions on child labor by having minimum age requirement, the cap on the number of working hours. etc therefore trade unions were legalized.
Impact of colonies (India)
From exporter of finished goods to exporter of Raw materials
The handicraft sector was destroyed because of cheaper British goods.
Because of the lack of industrialization of India, the workers of the handicraft sector were not absorbed in factories, therefore, they had to fall back upon the agriculture sector which led to overburdening of the agriculture sector.
Suez Canal (1859-69) - reduced distance between Britain and India by 4500miles.
POST-1870 IR HALLMARKS:
Electricity, oil, and Gas as sources of energy.
Internal combustion engine
Chemical Synthesis ie Chemical sector Played a very impor­tant role
BANKING SECTOR PLAYED Important Role As, unlike Britain, There Was Less Accumulation of WEALTH FROM TRADE.
New methods of communication (telephone).
STATE TOOK LEAD in Assisting CAPITALISTS While in Britain IR was the TOTAL initiative of capitalists.
This Was because PROSPEROUS CAPITALIST CLASS DID NOT Properly exist in the Rest of Europe
Industrial espionage to Get Technology From Britain.
IR in Germany:
RAPIDLY INDUSTRIALIZED POST-1870 To Become 2nd European Economic POWER BUT WAS FAR BEHIND Britain
However, Became A Rival in Coal 4 Pig iron and also A NAVAL RIVAL BY 1917.
IR in France:
It lacked raw materials like coal and iron and was far behind Germany.
IR in Italy:
LACKED RAW MATERIALS Like COAL and IRON.
IR in Russia:
Russia WAS Rich in RAW MATERIALS BUT LACKED Free LABOR( ONLY in 1861 THAT SERFDOM WAS ABOLISHED).
IT LACKED CAPITAL For investment
It has VAST TERRITORY and  SCATTERED POPULATION Therefore High Cost Of Logistics For Interconnecting The economy that is FOR Movement OF GOODS and  LABOR.
Constant warfare:
1853 -56 Crimean WAR,
1904-05 Lost Russo- Japanese WAR, 
1905- 1stRussianRevolution,
1914 -17 WWI,
1917- 2ndRussian Revolution,
1918- 20 Russian Civil WAR
IR in the USA:
Busy in Territorial Expansion and Then Civil WAR from 1861 to 65.
IR Post 1865
IR in Japan:
IR only after the Meiji restoration of 1868.

Colonialism in China(03:40 PM)

Location of the important regions on the map.
Background:
By 1514, the Portuguese found a new route to China. 
They set up the trading center at Canton.
Gradually, other European powers also started trading via CAnton port.
China was ruled by the Manchu dynasty from the 1640s to 1911.
European powers especially France tried to export Christianity to China as they gave protection to the Christian missionaries.
This led to China adopting the policy of seclusion.
Whereby:
1. No diplomatic relations with European powers.
2. Europeans to trade only with 13 state-appointed Chinese traders. and only via Canton port.
3. Entry of foreigners into China was discouraged.
4. Not importing/buying European goods.(Also China was a rich civilization and it did not need anything from Europe)
First Opium War(1840-1842)(Britain versus China)
Reason:
1. British Mercantilism-  As per this policy, Britain wanted to maximize the inflow of gold and minimize the outflow of gold that maximizes net exports in value terms.
This policy goal was hurt due to the policy of seclusion of China as per which China was not buying any British goods.
Therefore, the British began the illegal opium trade.
2. The quantum of this trade was so high that by the 1830s, Britain achieved a positive balance of trade with China.
Also, this made the Indian colony more profitable as the Opium came from India. Therefore, Indian opium financed British imports from China.
3. However, this destroyed the Chinese youth.
Chinese authorities finally reacted by destroying Opium loaded in British ships.
Now British Parliament approved war on China on grounds of ensuring the security of the property of British traders.
Also, Chinese action was considered a challenge to British supremacy.
