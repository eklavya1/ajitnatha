Also called suricate, burrowing member of the mongoose family (Herpestidae), found in southwestern Africa, is unmistakably recognizable in its upright "sentinel" posture as it watches for predators.
The meerkat is slender and has a pointed little face, tiny ears, and black eye patches. Body length is about 29 cm (11 inches), and the smooth, pointed tail is 19 cm long.
Colour varies from dark to grizzled light gray or tan, with broad dark bars across the back and a black-tipped tail. Adults weigh less than 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds), with older dominant breeders heavier than subordinates.
