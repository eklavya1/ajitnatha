[[gandhi]] was deeply influenced by this book

unto this last is an essay critical of [[_economics 经济 moc]] by john ruskin, first published between august & december [[1860]] in monthly journal cornhill magazine in four articles. ruskin says himself that articles were "very violently criticized", forcing publisher to stop its publication after four months. subscribers sent protest letters, but ruskin countered attack & published four articles in a book in may 1862. *the book greatly influenced nonviolent activist mahatma gandhi*.  book is also cited as an inspiration upon british labour party in its initial stages, a survey of labour members of parliament after party achieved its electoral breakthrough in 1906 uk general election listing book as one of their key influences. title is a quotation from parable of workers in vineyard:

i will give unto this last, even as unto thee. is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own? is thine eye evil, because i am good? so last shall be first, & first last: for many be called, but few chosen.

the "last" are eleventh hour labourers, who are paid as if they had worked entire day.  rather than discuss contemporary religious interpretation of parable, whereby eleventh hour labourers would be death-bed converts, or peoples of world who come late to religion, ruskin looks at social & economic implications, discussing issues such as who should receive a living wage. this essay is very critical of economists of 18th & 19th centuries. in this sense, ruskin is a precursor of social [[economy]]. because essay also attacks destructive effects of industrialism upon natural world, some historians have seen it as anticipating green movement.

essay begins with following verses, taken from matthew 20:13 & zechariah 11:12 respectively (in king james version):
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unto%20this%20last)

friend, i do thee no wrong.
didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
take that thine is, and go thine way.
i will give unto this last even as unto thee.

if ye think good, give me my price;
and if not, forbear.
so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of [[silver]].
