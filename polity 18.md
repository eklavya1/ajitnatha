# quo warranto
- 時 - `10:45 PM 10/8/2021`
- [[quo warranto]]
- [[note]] - [[locus standi]] is not req for [[habeas corpus]] & [[quo warranto]]
- any person can file it whether aggrieved or not
- off notes
- [[quo warranto]] means show me your warrant of appointment. it's a [[writs]] that is issued by court to examine of claim of a person to a public office.
- if person is not able to show legal right, court [[may]] throw him outta office
- essential conditions for writ of [[quo warranto]] -
		1. office must be public & must be a creation of a statute or [[indian constitution]]
		2. there should have been a contravention of statute of const in appointing such person to office. basic logic behind writ of quo warrant is that public has interest to see that `unlawful claimant` does not usurp a `public office`. a writ of [[quo warranto]] lies against person who is not entitled to hold ayou public office & is only a usurper of such office.
