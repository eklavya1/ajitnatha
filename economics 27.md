class started with a brief discussion on the previous class(9:06:00 am)

- speculative demand
- handling of queries from the previous classes

## gdp deflator (9:38:00 am)
- the [[gdp deflator]] is a measure of inflation.
- it is the ratio of the value of goods and services an economy produces in a particular year at current prices to that of prices that prevailed during the base year.
- it is the ratio of nominal gdp to real gdp.

## continuation of speculative demand (9:40:00 am)
- when interest rates are expected to move up, people anticipate a loss in the value of their assets.
- therefore, they will sell their assets today and convert them into speculative components because they expect interest rates to rise is their view is that interest rates are low at present
- r min. is that abstract interest rate at which everybody expects that interest rates will only rise in future.
- therefore, everybody expects a deterioration of their assets in the future and hence their decision today would be to sell their assets and convert them into speculative components.
- when r=rmin, everybody expects a capital loss, hence everybody converts their assets into speculative components.
- therefore, the speculative demand for money is said to be infinitely elastic. (explained along with liquidity trap)
- on the other hand, r max. is that abstract interest rate at which everybody expects interest rates to only fall in the future.
- therefore everyone anticipates a capital gain.
- hence, everybody will convert their speculative component into assets.
- therefore, the speculative demand for money would be zero.
- mds is inversely proportional to interest rates.

## liquidity trap (10:20:00 am)
- it is a situation where monetary policy seems to fail or becomes greatly limited in its objectives and how to achieve them.
- monetary policy is demand-side policy i.e. it is conducted as a tool to control the demand for money.
- an easy monetary policy essentially means that money would be made easily available to those who demand it.
- a stringent or tight monetary policy refers to a situation in which money is made costly that is it is available to those who demand it on difficult terms.
- money is made available easily during the easy monetary policy in order to spurt demand i.e. increase demand.
- if money is made easily available, then people will be tempted to borrow and spend it, thereby increasing the demand for goods and services in the economy.
- a liquidity trap is a situation in which money, even if made easily available is unable to spurt the demand in the economy.
- hence we see that monetary policy becomes limited to achieving its objectives.
- limitations of monetary policy in form of a liquidity trap are seen when interest rates in the economy are close to r min. level.
- at r=r min, the speculative component is infinite.
- if there is an increase in money supply by the central bank, it is not going to increase any transaction demand and will not be invested in any asset.
- it will only satiate people's cravings for cash, such a situation is a liquidity trap, where any new money which is being supplied is not being used for transactions or investment rather is only being stored as cash.
- more on liquidity trap with quantitative easing (q.e)

## money supply (11:10:00 am)
- definition of money supply
- money demand and supply
- measurement of money supply
- creation of money - by central bank and banking system.
- control of money - monetary policy
- monetary policy tools
- limitation and evaluation of monetary policy.
- banking

## money supply (11:13:00 am)
- it is a determined number/ amount of money circulating/ present in the economy at any given time.
- money demand can be expressed as follows:
- mdt is directly proportional to y.
- mds is inversely proportional to r
- md= a0+b0y -c0r
- this simply expresses the idea that the demand for money is directly proportional to the level of gdp (transaction demand) and inversely proportional to the interest rates (speculative demand).
- at some given level of gdp i.e y= y0 
- the total demand for money can be expressed as:
- md= a0 + b0y0- c0r
- this can be plotted in a graphical manner.

## the market of money (11:51:00 am)
- the market of money is different from the more commonly used term "money market".
- the money market is used in the context of financial markets which deal with short-term demand and supply of money.
- the money market usually deals with short-term instruments traded in financial markets.
- the market of money which we refer to here is simply like the market of any good and service which is demanded and supplied and whose demand and supply varies with price.
- in the case of money, the price of money is simply the interest rate at which money is available.
- in order to get money, you pay a cost in form of interest rates.
- the cost of money in the market will be determined by its demand and supply.
- md = a0+b0y-c0r
- at a given level of gdp, y0 md= a0+b0y0-c0r 
- further, ms i.e supply of money is a determined number equal to ms0 (set by rbi).
- given md and ms, the following can be illustrated as the market of money.
- r0 is that rate of interest at which the demand for money and supply of money is equal.
- therefore, the cost of money at equilibrium would be r0.
- rbi determines the supply of money based on multiple objectives such as growth and inflation. (refer to growth-inflation trade-off )
- suppose rbi assesses that the present level of the money supply is inadequate and therefore decides to increase ms, ms will shift outwards and therefore interest rate will decrease.
- money supply increases to ms1, which causes to fall from r0 to r1.
- change in money supply influences interest rates.
- at the same time, change in interest rates also influences the money supply (more on it later).

## measures of money supply (12:07:00 pm)
- [[rbi]] creates money in the economy initially.
- from this money, the banking system created more money.
- the amount of money present in the economy i.e. money supply can be measured using the following definitions of the money supply.
- m1 = cc + dd
- it is the most liquid but most narrow measure of money circulating in the economy.
- cc: currency in circulation
- dd: it is the net demand deposits with the banks.
- the word net refers to only demand deposits of people or other entities with the banks are counted but inter-bank deposits are excluded i.e. net demand deposits do not include the deposits that 1 bank has with another bank.
- m2= m1 + demand deposits with post-offices
- m3= m1 + time deposits with banks 
- m3 is a broader measure of the money supply which includes the less liquid forms of money like fixed deposits and recurring deposits.
- m4= m3 + all other deposits with post offices.
- it is the broadest but least liquid measure of the money supply.

the topics for the next class: creation of money - by central bank and banking system.
