# anti-defection law
(1:09 pm)
### kihoto hollohan vs zachillhu & others (1992)
- court upheld that discretion is available to speaker in deciding cases of disqualification of mlas. [[1992]]
-   some of **concerns with anti-defection law**
	- time for decision taken by speaker should be fixed.
	- anti defection can lead to a lack of internal party [[democracy]].Â 
	- [[independence]] of legislators gets lost.
	- compulsion on members to follow party guidelines.

## disqualification under anti-defection
-   in case of a perverse decision by speaker, [[judicial review]] is possible.
-   [[whip]]: in confidence / no-confidence motion, in vote of thanks to presidentâ€™s speech.
-   whip should be made mandatory for party in power.Â 
-   any matter that is central to manifesto of party in power.
-   non-attendance in parliament / legislature can also be a ground for disqualification.Â 
-   if a person is absent from lok sabha / rajya sabha for more than 60 days consecutively, without prior permission of house, he/she may be disqualified.
-   any disqualification other than anti-defection law should be decided by president/governor on advice of election commission.
-   article 102. (e) if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by parliament.
-   article 103. decision on questions as to disqualifications of members.
	-   clause (1) if any question arises as to whether a member of either house of parliament has become subject to any of disqualifications mentioned in clause (1) of article 102, question shall be referred for decision of president & his decision shall be final.
	-   clause (2) before giving any decision on any such question, president shall obtain opinion of election commission & shall act acc to such opinion.
-   [[a102 disqualification s for membership]]: speaker shall not accept resignation if resignation is not genuine or voluntary.
-   [[a101]] (4) if for a period of sixty days a member of either house of parliament is without permission of house absent from all meetings thereof, house may declare his seat vacant:
-   provided that in computing said period of sixty days no account shall be taken of any period during which house is prorogued or is adjourned for more than 4 consecutive days.

# motion & resolution
(1:57 pm)
-   motion is a device or tool that is used in parliament to initiate any kind of discussion.Â 
-   any legislative business in house is initiated by a motion.Â 
-   if process is related to removal of [[president]] of india.
# resolution
-   motions which are voted upon & where opinion of house is solicited, are k/a resolution.
-   resolution is a sub-set of motion.
-   resolution is a motion, which is voted.

	-   any member other than ministers will be c/a as private member.

# legislative procedure in parliament
(2:05 pm)
-   ordinary bills can be passed by both ministers as well as private members.Â 
-   since [[1972]], no private memberâ€™s bill has been passed by parliament.Â 

**why it's difficult for private memberâ€™s bills to be passed?**
-   lack of majority for private member bill.
-   for any bill to become act, it requires presidential assent.
-   president acts on aid & advice of council of ministers.
-   drafting of requires expertise/bureaucracy which is lacked by private members.
# bills are passed in 3 stages
## 1st reading
-   1st reading is concerned by general discussion.Â 
-   then it's passed by requisite majority (e.g. simple majority for ordinary bills, a sp. majority for constitutional amendment bills.)
-   formation of parliamentary committees: to give relevant expertise, to avoid large group discussions of parliament as a whole.Â 

**two types of parliamentary committees:** 
-   [[ad hoc]] committees: which are created for a specific purpose & specific duration (selected members are present).Â 
-   usually, ad hoc committees are of 2 types:
	-   select committees
	-   if both houses select a committee (it will be c/a a joint committee).Â 
	-   public consultation is also done.Â 

**standing committees:** 
-   e. g. pac, estimates committee, department related standing committees( e.g. defense-related drsc).
## 2nd reading
-   clause by clause discussion, parliamentarians can also suggest amendments to various clauses of bill.
-   every clause is supposed to be voted upon.
## 3rd reading
-   entire bill is put to a final vote.
-   it becomes act of parliament, then president issues a notification.
# voting process
(2:48 pm)
-   by a voice vote.
-   show of hands (presiding officer may ask legislators to raise hands).
-   by division (electronic voting).
# types of bills
-   (3:13 pm)
-   ordinary bill: it can be introduced in both houses of parliament.
-   it requires a simple majority to be passed (majority of members present & voting).
-   let us say: if it's introduced in lok sabha, but rajya sabha can accept bill as it is, or it can reject bill, or it can suggest amendments.
-   if bill is accepted by rajya sabha (in case of ordinary bills, both houses have same powers), it will be sent to presidential assent.
-   if it's rejected, it will be c/a a deadlock.
-   in case of a deadlock b/w 2 houses: a joint sitting is summoned by president (article 108).

# joint sitting of both houses in certain cases:
(3:18 pm)

-   article 108: (1) if after a bill has been passed by 1 house & transmitted to other houseâ€”
-   (a) bill is rejected by other house; or
-   (b) houses have finally disagreed as to amendments to be made in bill; or
-   (c) more than six months elapse from date of reception of bill by other house without bill being passed by it,Â 
-   president may, unless bill has elapsed by reason of a dissolution of house of people, notify to houses by message if they are sitting or by public notification if they are not sitting, his intention to summon them to meet in a joint sitting for purpose of deliberating & voting on bill: provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to a money bill.
-   joint session is convened in central house of parliament.
-   joint session is preceded by lok sabha speaker.
-   both houses of parliament vote together. (lok sabha has upper hand in a joint sitting).
-   in case of a constitutional amendment bill, both housed do not agree, bill becomes dead.
-   in case of a money bill, rajya sabha has limited say.Â 
-   if bill is not acted, keeps pending in other house of parliament. if other house does not act for a period of 6 months, then president will assume that a situation of deadlock has reached.Â 

# lapsing of bill
(3:27 pm)

**in case of ordinary bill:** 

-   before approval of bill, if lok sabha gets dissolved, bill will lapse.
-   if a bill is passed by lok sabha & is pending in rajya sabha, during this lok sabha gets dissolved, bill will lapse.
-   if it originates in rajya sabha, & lok sabha dissolves, it will be pending.Â 
-   if bill is passed by rajya sabha, goes to lok sabha, lok sabha dissolved, then also bill will lapse.Â 
-   bill passed by lok sabha, passed by rajya sabha also, it was pending approval, & lok sabha dissolves, bill will not lapse.Â 

**in case of a constitutional amendment bill:** 

-   in case of a constitutional amendment bill, joint sitting is not allowed, because it will give unnecessary edge to lok sabha.
-   it will district federalism.
-   in case of a constitutional amendment bill: president cannot withhold assent, because 24th amendment act says, [[president]] has to assent to a constitutional amendment bill.
