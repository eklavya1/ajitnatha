The Hooghly River (Anglicized alternatively spelled Hoogli or Hugli) or the BhƒÅgirathi-Hooghly, called the 'Ganga' or the 'Kati-Ganga' in mythological texts, is the eastern distributary of the Ganges River in West Bengal, India, rising close to Giria in Murshidabad. It is referred to as an arm of the Ganges in the Encyclopedia Britannica and was previously the major flow of the waters of the Ganga It is because of this reason, people believe the holy waters of the Ganga still flow through the Bhagirathi-Hoogly and hence it is still worshipped today. The other distributary of Ganga then flows into Bangladesh as the Padma. Today there is a man-made canal called the Farakka Feeder Canal connecting the Ganges to the Bhagirathi.

The river flows through the Rarh region, the lower deltaic districts of West Bengal, and eventually into the Bay of Bengal. The upper riparian zone of the river is called Bhagirathi while the lower riparian zone is called Hooghly. Major rivers that drain into the Bhagirathi-Hooghly include Mayurakshi, Jalangi , Ajay, Damodar, Rupnarayan and Haldi rivers other than the Ganges. Hugli-Chinsura, Bandel, Chandannagar, Srirampur, Barrackpur,  Rishra, Uttarpara, Titagarh, Kamarhati, Agarpara, Baranagar and Kolkata are located on the banks of this river.
