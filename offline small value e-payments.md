RBI has come out with a framework for facilitating small-value digital payments in offline mode.

To promote digital payments in semi-urban and rural areas, this framework allows offline payments up to Rs. 200 per transaction, subject to an overall limit of Rs 2,000.
Offline digital payment doesn't require Intemet or telecom connectivity. Hence statement 3 is correct.
Under the new framework, offline payments can be carried out face-to-face (proximity mode) using any channel/ instrument like cards, wallets and mobile devices.
Such transactions wouldn't require an Additional Factor of Authentication.
Since the transactions are offline, alerts (by way of SMS and/or e-mail) will be received by the customer after a time lag.
The RBI said the framework took effect 'immediately'.
It also said that authorised Payment System Operators (PSOs) and Payment System Participants (PSPs) looking to facilitate small value offline digital payments have to comply with the new guidelines.
