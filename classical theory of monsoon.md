	- _off notes_
	- this theory explains the phenomenon of [[monsoon]] as huge land and sea breeze due to the reversal of [[temperature]] & [[pressure]] in northern plains from summer to winter
	- during summers, the high temp & low press attracts winds from [[arabian sea]] during [[winter]]s `low temp & high press` causes winds to blow away from land to sea
