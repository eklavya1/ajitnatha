drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint). digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics software in a computer. common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. there are many digital art programs and devices.

a drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. the most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used. temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard. drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. it is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas. the wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.

in addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing. a quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. an artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman.
