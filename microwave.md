Microwaves are defined as electromagnetic radiations with a frequency ranging between *300 MHz to 300 GHz* while the [[wavelength]] ranges from 1 mm to around 30 cm.
They fall between infrared radiation and radio waves in the electromagnetic spectrum.
**Properties of microwaves**
Metal surfaces reflect microwaves.
Microwave transmission is affected by wave effects such as refraction, reflection, interference, and diffraction.
Microwaves can pass through glass and plastic.
