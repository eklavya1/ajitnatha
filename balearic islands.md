The Balearic Islands ( BAL-ee-ARR-ik or  bə-LEER-ik; Catalan: Illes Balears [ˈiʎəz bəleˈas]; Spanish: Islas Baleares [ˈizlaz βaleˈaɾes]) are a Spanish archipelago in the Balearic Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.

Its four largest islands are Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera. Many of its minor islands and islets are close to the larger islands, including Cabrera, Dragonera, and S'Espalmador. The islands have a Mediterranean climate, and the four major islands are all popular tourist destinations. Ibiza, in particular, is known as an international party destination, attracting many of the world's most popular DJs to its nightclubs. The islands' culture and cuisine are similar to those of the rest of Spain but have their own distinctive features.

The archipelago is an autonomous community and a province of Spain; its capital is Palma. The 2007 Statute of Autonomy designates the Balearic Islands as one of the nationalities of Spain. The official languages of the Balearic Islands are Catalan and Spanish.
