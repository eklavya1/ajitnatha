india foreign policy with respect to srilanka (2:30 pm)

india has followed a two-pronged relation with srilanka - sought good relation with sinhalese majority- adoption of democracy & majority politics have made sinhalese important for pursuit of indian interest.
please tamil minority since they have fraternal & linguistic ties with their brethren in indian state of tamil nadu.
ethnic war in srilanka b/w sinhalese majority & tamils has further complicated india's two-pronged strategy with respect to island nation.
unlike china which follows purely strategic foreign policy with respect to srilanka india's policy gets complicated c of domestic factor.
for instance - after end of civil war in srilanka in 2009, india was forced to vote in favor of unhrc resolution against srilanka despite its apprehension on how would it affect & push srilanka towards china. 
since  tamil nadu-based regional parties were part of upa coalition govt.

roots of conflict b/w sinhalese & tamils  were shown during british rule of srilanka (3:13 pm)
roots of conflict b/w sinhalese & tamils  were shown during british rule of srilanka (3:13 pm)

tamil population was quick to adapt o english language & therefore & therefore beg lucrative govt jobs.
british also sowed communal seed by adopting decide & rule policy.
it introduced communal representation which worked to tamil minorities' advantage.
this sowed seeds of ill-will against tamils in sinhalese.
with independence of srilanka in 1948, they adopted democracy & majority politics & undertook a series of steps that disadvantaged tamil minority.
given stringent documentary evidence required to prove their srilanka citizenship, act made indian origin tamils stateless.
this created a refugee crisis in india & got goi got involved in ethnic crisis in beginning.
india & sl entered into 2 agreements in 1964 & 74 under which india accommodated a large number of indian-origin tamils.
however, indira gandhi govt after being made aware of natural increase conundrum clarified that india would not accept any more indian-origin tamils in future.
in response, violent attacks broke out against tamil in plantation area with objective to drive out as many tamils into india as possible.
sinhala only act 1956- it replaced english with only sinhala as only official language.
aim was to deprive tamils of access to higher education & govt jobs.
indian govt suggested a three-language solution with sinhalese & tamil as 1st & 2nd official languages respectively & english as link language.
then pm of srilanka accepted india's recommendation & was consequently assassinated.
this time witnessed rise of leaders such as jayawardene who went on to become sri lanka president & adopted even more coercive measures against sinhalese.
it officially sponsored colonization of north & east by sinhala farmers aroused tamil resistance.

rise of tamil militancy( 3:42 pm)
rise of tamil militancy( 3:42 pm)

till then peaceful movements sought a constitutional solution, for instance, tulf ( tamil united liberation front )was a political party devoted to tamil rights.
however, by 1970s tamil grievance gave rise to militant groups & 1 of them was ltte & it emerged as leader.
india supported ltte to destabilize then jayawardene govt.
it's in fact alleged that ltte was trained by raw & received financial assistance from rich tamil diaspora of other western countries.

civil war in srilanka (3:50 pm)
civil war in srilanka (3:50 pm)

jayawardene govt-sanctioned operation vadamarachi in 1897.
under it, srilankan govt imposed official blockade of jaffna peninsula.
indian govt was not willing to accept a military solution to ethnic crisis demanding political rights.
therefore under operation poomalai airdropped humanitarian aid to jaffna.
this forced sri lankan govt to sign india -srilanka accord of 1987.
srilankan govt accepted that it would devolve powers to newly merged north & eastern province which would be c/a northeastern province where & grant official status to tamil language( 13th amendment to srilankan constitution ).
it was a bilateral agreement b/w india & srilankan govt without direct involvement of ltte or other militant groups.
indian govt undertook obligation to enforce accord by sending indian peacekeeping force to enforce cease-fire b/w ltte & sri lankan govt.
srilankan forces were expected to return to their barracks & sri lankan govt was to bring necessary amendments to enforce its part of deal.

war b/w ltte & ipkf(indian peacekeeping keeping forces ) (4:10 pm)
war b/w ltte & ipkf(indian peacekeeping keeping forces ) (4:10 pm)

ipkf were ill-equipped & ill-trained in geography & terrain of srilanka & didn't even have a map of their region.
once violence broke out against tamils in southern srilanka ltte were quick to take up arms & since srilankan force was in barracks & ltte was unhappy with its exclusion from india-imposed solution, ipkf become their targets.
consequently b/w 1987 till 1990, 1200 indian soldiers succumbed or died & in 1991 then indian pm rajiv gandhi was assassinated.
hence, india has adopted a hands-off policy in sri lankan civil war & its period of regional supremacy came to end.
