Sanchi is a small temple built about 400 A.D. and everything attempted earlier, is done much better here.
The stones are smaller and laid out in regular neat rows; the roof has been separated so that the portico has a slightly less prominent height - the Sanctum-Sanctorum being the main house of God.
Gargoyles have been thoughtfully provided to drain off rainwater and the four back pillars are more slender and beautifully carved.
This temple truly belongs to the Classical Period and is marked by elegance, harmony, balance, and dignity.
Temple 17 is an early stand-alone temple (following the great cave temples of Indian rock-cut architecture), as it dates to the early Gupta period (probably the first quarter of the 5th century CE).
The decoration is minimal and is only used where one structural form joins another.
An inverted lotus is placed where the top of the shaft joins.
The capital and little lions, seated back to back, act as support where the roof rests on top of the pillar.
The entire structure is simple, with no complications.
However, with time the extremely plain and simple temple architecture becomes increasingly complicated, from a simple quadrangle it evolves into salient and re-entering angles, protrusions are added, making the outline more and more involved, till eventually, it becomes almost like a star with more than a hundred little comers on the ground level.
