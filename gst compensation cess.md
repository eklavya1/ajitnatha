gst compensation act, 2017 guaranteed states that they would be compensated for any loss of revenue in first 5 years of gst implementation, until 2022, using a cess levied on sin and luxury goods.
a state that had collected tax less than this amount in any year would be compensated for shortfall.
amount would be paid every 2 months based on provisional accounts & adjusted every year after state's accounts were audited by comptroller & auditor general.
this scheme is valid for 5 years, i.e., till june 2022. 
entire cess collected during year is required to be credited to a non-lapsable fund - gst compensation cess fund.
