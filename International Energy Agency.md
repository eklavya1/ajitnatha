The oil will be released "in parallel and in consultation with" the US, China, Japan and South read Korea, the Oil Ministry said in a statement, without specifying a timeframe. 

Why are these countries releasing oil from strategic reserves?
	It is part of a concerted effort to negate upward pressure on crude prices from OPEC+ — a 13-country grouping of oil exporters that has been joined since 2016 by 10 others led by Russia to decide production quotas — keeping supply below demand, even though the action is largely symbolic in nature.
	India has called for an increase in the supply by OPEC+ at multiple intemational forums and in bilateral talks with oil producing countries.
	India argues that high crude oil prices are impacting the post-Covid economic recovery, especially in developing countries.
What are India's strategic petroleum reserves?
	- [ ] Under the first stage of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve project, underground rock cavems with total storage of 5.33 MMT, or about 38 million barrels of crude oil, have been commissioned at three locations — Visakhapatnam (1.33 MMT), Mangalore (1.5 MMT), and Padur in [[Karnataka]] (2.5 MMT).
	- [ ] The Intemational Energy Agency (IEA) recommends that all countries hold crude oil stocks worth 90 days of imports.
