## objectives & conduct of monetary policy
[9:20 am]
**terms used in table below -**
this reminds me of sid meier's civiliation V computer game
ms = money supply
mp = monetary policy
4 cases of monetary policy are below

- [[monetary policy]] is essentially a demand-side policy that controls demand by increasing or decreasing [[money supply]].
- by increasing money supply it seeks to facilitate demand & thereby cause growth.
- at same time, an increase in demand also causes an increase in prices i.e. it is inflationary.
- as can be seen, decision of monetary policy can either facilitate [[growth]] by increasing money supply or reduce prices by decreasing money supply.
- **as such, there is a growth - inflation tradeoff**. --> [[zero-sum game]]
## factors facilitating growth
- policies of [[government]] such as regulations pertaining to [[labor]], tax environment, ease of doing business, infrastructure, international demand for domestic goods, money supply facilitating transactions as well as investment, etc.
- similarly, [[inflation]] is also controlled or influenced by a number of [[demand]]-side & [[supply]]-side factors.
- when it comes to [[money supply]], its effect in causing [[growth]] is conditioned upon a number of other factors, thereby, by itself, money supply is only limited in its ability to cause growth, although it is important.
- when it comes to prices, money supply may not be only factor that causes high prices, however, it is one of most effective factors that can bring down high prices.
- prices may be high because of any reason, a reduction in money supply shall be able to bring them down.

- recognizing this i.e. more effectiveness of money supply in controlling prices as compared to facilitating growth rbi was given target to keep inflation within a range of 2-6%, under *inflation targeting framework*. under this, primary objective of rbi is to target inflation within said range. it does not mean that facilitating growth is not objective of rbi.
- it simply means targeting inflation can be more effectively done by RBI & thus should be a primary target of monetary policy while facilitating growth simultaneously.
- 	inflation targeting framework is an agreement signed between [[government]] of [[india]] & rbi in [[2015]], where primary objective of monetary policy is to target cpi-inflation in a range of 4±2% i.e. 2-6%.
- under this, decisions of monetary policy are taken up by monetary policy committee (mpc) which is a 6 membered body comprising of 3 members of RBI, & 3 independent members nominated by [[government]].
- decisions are taken up by a majority vote & rbi [[governor]] has a casting vote in case of a tie.
- any disagreement amongst members is also transparently communicated via minutes of meetings released to public.
## transmission of monetary policy
[11:17 am]
- [[monetary policy]] is conducted by RBI with tools which mostly affect [[money multiplier]] process. therefore even though decision of 
- monetary policy is taken by rbi, its actual implementation is largely in hands of banks. whatever money supply increased or decreased & to what degree is evaluated while evaluating monetary policy.

- it is studied through concept of transmission - ie how effectively was monetary policy transmitted by banks from rbi to economy.

- most important policy tool for controlling [[money supply]] is [[repo rate]], whether increase or decrease in repo rate results in an increase or decrease of lending rate by banks determines how effective monetary policy is.

## evolution of interest rates -
- original heading =  to understand this we look at [[evolution]] of interest rates -
### [[prime lending rate]] (PLR) 
### [[base rate]]
### [[marginal cost of funds based lending rate]] (MCLR)
1. [[prime lending rate]] (PLR) 

```mermaid 2022-03-22 - 17:41
graph LR
banks---PLR--->customers
```

it was an *opaque* [[interest rate]] that banks used to charge from their prime customers. there was no minimum declared rate & therefore some people were able to negotiate very low-interest rates called PLR while others had to bear burden of cross subsidizing them.

2. [[base rate]]
base rate is a *transparently* declared minimum [[interest rate]] that banks will charge while lending.
it eliminates process of cross-subsidization as everybody pays an interest which is base rate plus their risk.
however, even base rate is not sensitive enough to policy [[repo rate]] & therefore transmission of monetary policy isn't effective.
it was seen that despite rbi changing repo rate, banks did not pass on these changes especially in cases of reduction of repo rate to economy.

3. [[marginal cost of funds based lending rate]] (MCLR)
it is a transparently declared base rate along with a declared formula of calculating it which clearly shows a banks’ variable cost.
variable costs are cost incurred by bank to arrange more funds.
most of costs that banks incur are fixed such as interest on deposits, payment of salaries, operational expenses, etc.
bank may also have fixed desirable [[profit]]. its variable costs are those which it has to pay while arranging more funds in case it has to lend them.

total costs= fixed +variable
mclr=f (fixed, variable costs)
for example; mclr=8%+repo rate
