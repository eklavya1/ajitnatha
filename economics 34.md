## provisioning
whenever bank gives loan, it sets aside some money for loan, this is k/a provisioning. #doubt 
## bank’s capital
how much amount of [[capital]] [[bank]] should have, in form of risk-weighted [[asset]] ratio.
## loan write-off
risker loan - when loan becomes [[non performing asset]].
having NPAs for bank reduces its capital available, hence its ability to do business will be greatly dented.
hence, it would be in bank’s interest to remove that bad loan *off its books*. hence this is k/a **write off**.
by writing off bad loan/asset, bank frees capital.
banks are reluctant to write off loan because it requires them to identify loss.
*writing off does not mean that bank is letting off defaulter.*
this means that bank wants to free ‘provisioning’ which was locked against that bad loan.

## twin balance sheet problem
company’s balance sheet faces problem in case of bad loan, as they are unable to pay it back to bank.
bank’s balance sheet is also impacted as bank’s loan is not recovered.

## why NPA arises
(13:36)
bank gives loan to person.
person is supposed to pay back principal + interests.
person may not be able to pay back due to: 
	loss in profit,
	economic slowdown, 
	willful default/ malafide intentions.
	excessive loans, unsustainable borrowings, etc.
	overvaluations of company.
### health of banks: correcting NPAs
(14:05)
reasons for NPAs -
wilful default -
it pertains to not returning money despite having capability to do so.
also, diverting money for some other purpose apart from what it was borrowed for is also considered wilful default.
economic reasons such as 
1. losses to company,
2. slowdown in economy,
3. slowdown in exporting country,
4. natural disasters & pandemics which reduce ability to do business.
5. borrowing at unsustainable condition such as higher rate of interest, international or geopolitical factors. --> [[ukraine]] [[finland]] [[poland]]

changes in govt policy such as withdrawal of support, specific policies of govgovt, such as free [[electricity]], which reduce capability of distribution company to purchase power; environmental norms which may make project prohibitively expensive, etc.

[[infrastructure]] projects usually have multiple points of failure & therefore have high probability of default.
key point in reasons for NPAs poor risk analysis.
& steps can be taken to hedge against them.
however, if they are ignored, then their effects become debilitating (difficult to handle).
refer to banking section in this year’s economic survey (in chapter 4 [[monetary policy]]).
### 4 r framework
(14:16)
1. **recognize** - recognition of extent of problem.
it was done through elaborate AQR ([[asset quality review]]) undertaken since [[2014]].
2. **resolve** - it involves various steps to resolve NPAs either back to performing assets or to ensure that banks are able to recover maximum that they can.
3. **recapitalize** - it was attempt to infuse adequate capital in banking system so that they could return to doing business profitably. 
4. **reform** - to reform banks’ conduct of business so that npproblem is minimized.
this pertains to reform in banking operations.

## evergreening loan
(14:32)
![[lord mountbatten#^5d37bb]]
when bank is not recognizing loan as NPA but as performing assets.
hence, bank tries to hide problem of bad loans by hiding it via *evergreening*. --> subcons thought [[2008 financial crisis]]
banks in such cases try to relax their norms, & bad loans further incr.
commonwealth games scams onwards, problem of NPA started increasing.
npa peaked around [[2016]]-[[2017]] at about 17%.

## S4A scheme (subsumed under IBC code)
(14:49)
scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed [[asset]]s, focused on restructuring of loans.
for ex, loan given to steel firm can be restructured, bank can advise steel firm to buy other assets than those for which firm has given original loan. 
ecovery of debts due to banks act (rddb act): in [[1993]], this act was passed, it set up 2 bodies -
	DEBT RECOVERY TRIBUNAL - to deal with such cases in which banks are involved.
	DEBTS RECOVERY APPELLATE TRIBUNALS (DRATs) - for appellate jurisdiction & recovery of debts, etc.
## securitization & reconstruction of financial assets & enforcement of security interest act, 2002 (sarfaesi act): 
#wo_de dont let assets lie idle, its sin
national asset reconstruction company was established under sarfaesi act.

only for secured loans, not applicable to [[agriculture]] loans.
securitization - converting loan into marketable security through issue of security receipts.
asset reconstruction: converting non-performing to performing assets.
enforcement of security interests: 
take possession of pledged interest.
take over its [[management]], appoint someone competent. [[caesar]]
ask debtors of borrower to pay their dues.

topics for next class: ibc code, bankruptcy, etc.
