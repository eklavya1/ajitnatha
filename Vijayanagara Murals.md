- The paintings of Brihadeswara temple exemplify the stylistic maturity the artists evolved over the years. Sinuous pre-determined flow of lines, supple modelling of figures,elongation of the physiognomic features of human figures— all these represent the perfection the Chola artist had achieved during the period on the one hand and the phase of transition on the other. With the decline of power of the Chola dynasty in the thirteenth century, the [[Vijayanagara Dynasty]] (fourteenth-sixteenth centuries) captured and brought under its control the region from Hampi to Trichy with Hampi serving as its capital. Many paintings survive in a number of temples. The paintings at [[Tiruparakunram]], near [[Trichy]], done in the [[14th century]] represent the early phase of the Vijayanagara style. In [[hampi]], the [[Virupaksha temple]] has paintings on the ceiling of its [[mandapa]] narrating events from dynastic history and episodes from the [[Ramayana]] and the [[mahabharata]]. Among the important panels are the ones which show [[Vidyaranya]], the spiritual teacher of [[Bukkaraya Harsha]], being carried in a palanquin in a procession and the incarnations of Vishnu. The faces of the figures are shown in profile, with large frontal eyes. The figures have narrow waists. In [[Lepakshi]], near [[Hindupur]], in present Andhra Pradesh, there are glorious examples of Vijayanagara paintings on the walls of the Shiva temple.

- In keeping with the tradition, the Vijayanagara painters evolved a pictorial language wherein the faces are shown in profile and figures and objects two-dimensionally. Lines become still but fluid, compositions appear in rectilinear compartments. These stylistic conventions of the preceding centuries were adopted by artists in various centres in South India as can be seen in the paintings of the Nayaka Period.

- Paintings of the Nayaka dynasty in the [[17th century]] and [[18th century]]ies are seen in [[Thiruparakunram]], [[Sreerangam]] and [[Tiruvarur]] in [[tamil nadu]]. In Thiruparakunram, paintings are found of two different periods—of the [[14th century]] and the [[17th century]]. Early paintings depict scenes from the life of [[vardhaman mahavira]].

- The Nayaka paintings depict episodes from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana and also scenes from Krishna-leela. In Tiruvarur, there is a panel narrating the story of Muchukunda. In Chidambaram, there are panels of paintings narrating stories related to Shiva and Vishnu— Shiva as Bhikshatana Murti, Vishnu as Mohini, etc.

- In the Sri Krishna temple at [[Chengam]] in [[Arcot]] District there are 60 panels narrating the story of the Ramayana which represent the late phase of Nayaka paintings.

- The examples cited above suggest that Nayaka paintings were more or less an extension of the Vijayanagara style with minor regional modifications and incorporations. The figures, mostly in profile, are set against a flat background. Male figures are shown slim-waisted but with less heavy abdoman as compared to those in Vijayanagara. The artist, as in the previous centuries and following traditions, has tried to infuse movement and make the space dynamic. The painting of Nataraja at [[Tiruvalanjuli]] is a good example.
