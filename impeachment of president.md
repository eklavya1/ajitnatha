The President can be removed from office by a process of impeachment for violation of the Constitution.
However, the Constitution does not define the meaning of the phrase violation of the Constitution.
The impeachment charges can be initiated by either House of Parliament.
These charges should be signed by one-fourth of members of the House (that framed the charges), and a 14 days' notice should be given to the President.
The nominated members of either House of Parliament can participate in the impeachment of the President though they do not participate in his election.
The elected members of the legislative assemblies of states and the Union Territories of Delhi and Puducherry do not participate in the impeachment of the President though they participate in his election.
In the History of the Indian Republic, no Indian President has been so far "impeached" from his post.
