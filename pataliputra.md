- Megasthenes was a Greek diplomat, historian, and ethnographer whose extensive writings on Indian cultures provided insight into the lives of ancient Indians under Chandragupta Maurya's rule.
- Although his book, the Indica, was lost with time, it has been partially reconstructed using literary sources from later authors.
- Megasthenes is known as the "Father of Indian History" because he was the first person to describe ancient India.
- Megasthenes became an ambassador for Seleucus I to the court of Chandragupta Marya in Pataliputra after the Seleucid-Mauryan War in 305 BC.
- Megasthenes visited India during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, but it is unclear when he arrived or how long he stayed.
- Megasthenes visited the Mauryan capital of Pataliputra, but it is unknown where else in India he went.
- He appears to have travelled through the Punjab region of northwestern India, as he gives a detailed account of the rivers there.
- He must have then travelled along the Yamuna and Ganga rivers to Pataliputra.
- During his time in India, he observed and recorded the Mauryan Empire's culture, daily routine, social structure, and so on. Indica is the name of the collection of his works that exists today.
- Megasthenes wrote an account about what he saw. Here is a part of his description of Patliputara: "This is a large and beautiful city. It is surrounded by a massive wall. It has 570 towers and 64 gates. The houses, of two and three stories, are built of and mud brick. The king's palace is also of wood and decorated with stone carvings. It is surrounded with gardens and enclosures for keeping birds."
