[[lichen]]
Lichens are capable to indicate air pollution, water pollution, heavy metals as well as radioactive particles. Hence option 3 is correct.

[[algae]]
Algae (seaweeds) are good indicators of heavy metal levels in marine environments and could be used for monitoring such pollutants in seas.
According to a new study in the Gulf of Kutch, which receives discharges containing heavy metals from several industries, various species of brown, red and green algae accumulate
heavy metals from seawater and sediments.
Heavy metals enter various organisms and trigger tissue damage.

[[bird]]
Birds are considered to be excellent indicator species. There are three main reasons for this.
they live in every climate and biome
they respond quickly to environmental change
they are relatively easy to track and count.

Certain molluscs indicate water pollution, while some mosses indicate soil pollution.
The Mussel Watch Programme is a global project to assess environmental impacts in coastal regions
