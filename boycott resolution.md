swadeshi movement was a self-sufficiency movement that was part of the indian independence movement and contributed to the development of indian nationalism.
after the british government's decision for the partition of bengal was made public in december 1903, there was a lot of growing discontentment among the indians.
in response, the swadeshi movement was formally started from town hall calcutta on 7 august 1905 with the passage of boycott resolution, to curb foreign goods by relying on domestic production.
o mahatma gandhi described it as the soul of swaraj (self-rule).
forms of struggle and impact:
boycott of foreign goods:
• boycott and public burning of foreign clothes, picketing of shops selling foreign goods, all became common in remote corners of bengal as well as in many major cities and towns across the country.
public meetings and processions emerged as major methods of mass mobilisations.
corps of volunteers or 'samitis':
• samitis such as the swadesh bandhab samiti of ashwini kumar dutta emerged as a very popular and powerful means of mobilisation.
• in tamil nadu, v.o. chidambaram pillai, subramania siva and some lawyers formed the swadesh sangam.
o imaginative use of traditional popular festivals and melas:
• tilak's shivaji and ganapati festivals in western india (maharashtra) became a medium of swadeshi propaganda.
emphasis is given to self reliance:
• under the movement, great emphasis was laid on 'atmasakti ' or self-reliance for the reassertion of national dignity and confidence.
programme of swadeshi or national education:
• bengal national college, national council of education were set up.
swadeshi or indigenous enterprises:
• swadeshi textile mills, factories of soap and match, tanneries, banks, insurance companies, shops, etc. were established.
youth, women, certain sections of zamindari, labour, some lower-middle and middle classes in towns and cities participated actively.
only a few muslims participated as hindu religious festivals like shivaji and ganapati festivals excluded muslims.
