Jaguar (Panthera onca) is the largest New World member of the cat family (Felidae), found from northern Mexico southward to northern Argentina.
Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts.
The jaguar is virtually extinct in the northem part of its original range and survives in reduced numbers only in remote areas of Central and South America; the largest known population exists in the Amazon rainforest.
