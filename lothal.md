The word Lothal, like Mohenjo-Daro, means the mound of the dead.
Lothal is located between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat.
It was situated near areas where raw materials such as semi-precious stones were easily available.
This was an important centre for making objects out of stone, shell, and metal.
There was also a storehouse in the city.
Many seals and sealings (the impression of seals on clay) were found in this storehouse.
A building that was found there was probably a workshop for making beads: pieces of stone, half-made beads, tools for bead making, and finished beads have all been found here.
The 4,500-year-old city **was mathematically planned**. It had a grid pattern with proper streets crossing at right angles and drainage systems.
The emphasis on cleanliness can be judged from the discovery of toilets and Iota-like jars which shows our fixation with washing up goes back to the Harappan Civilisation.
The city was divided into two parts: the upper town and the lower town. The remains of the brick walls there suggest wide streets, drains, and bathing platforms.
A rectangular basin has been found at Lothal that was said to be the dockyard.
It is 218 m long and 37 m wide and is bound on all sides by baked bricks.
