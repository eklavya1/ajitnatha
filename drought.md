## Hydrological drought
- is associated with the effects of periods of [[precipitation]] (including snowfall) shortfalls on surface or subsurface [[water]] [[supply]] (i.e., streamflow, reservoir and lake levels, groundwater). The [[frequency]] and severity of hydrological drought is often defined on a watershed or river basin scale
## Agricultural drought
it links various characteristics of meteorological (or hydrological) drought to agricultural impacts, focusing on precipitation shortages, differences between actual and potential evapotranspiration, soil water deficits, reduced groundwater or reservoir levels, and so forth.
