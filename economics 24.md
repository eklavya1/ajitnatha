Economics Class 24

The class started at 9.16 AM

A brief overview of the previous class: (Inflation, effects on producers & consumers, Investment & saving, time value of money, etc)

## Effects of inflation: (9.23 AM):

## Effects of inflation on borrowers and lenders: (9.24 AM)
- Inflation erodes the value of money over time.
- Erosion in value is because the amount of goods that money can buy at present is more than what it can buy in the future as the goods become expensive due to inflation.
- For a lender, the money is lent today and the interest is paid on this lent sum over the time period of lending.
- Because of inflation, this sum will keep on deteriorating but the borrower will continue to pay interest on this sum only.
- Therefore in real terms, the lender will lose out and the borrower will benefit because at the time of repayment interest would be paid on a deteriorated sum.
- This is captured through the concept of real interest rates.
- Real Interest rate = Nominal Interest rates - inflation.
- As can be seen, if inflation is high real interest rate would decrease and therefore, the lender will lose out (L-L: Lender-Lose) and the borrower will benefit (B-B: Borrower-Benefit).
- To shield themselves from the effects of inflation, the lenders usually charge an interest rate anchored to inflation that is they chared a fixed real interest rate and the nominal interest rate varies with inflation.

## Effects of inflation on Savings and investment: (at 9.36 AM)
Effects of inflation on Savings:
- Savings are similar to lending operations.
- The depositors save their money in bank accounts and the bank pays an interest on those deposits.
- Therefore, savings are also deteriorated by inflation.
- Savers are hurt most when inflation rises.
- Effects of inflation on Investment: (at 9.41 AM)
- Investment:
- Investment's decisions are the most crucial decisions in an economy for a business.
- Investment signifies a greater expectation of demand from the economy.
- A business takes investment decisions when they expect that their present capacity may not be sufficient to meet the expected demand in future.
- An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation.
- Investment decisions can be broken down to be dependent upon two types of factors.
- a. Rational & objectively measurable that is the interest rate.
- b. Subjective expectations from the future. Eg: growth rate of the economy, incomes, expected demand, future interest rates, etc.
- It can be argued that when interests are high lesser number of businesses will expect to generate a positive, desirable return on their investment.
- When interests rates are low, more businesses will expect to generate a desirable return in the future.
- Therefore, investment is inversely related to interest rate keeping other factors constant.
- Investment can also be encouraged to some extent through inflation as businesses expect to reap more benefits from their products due to higher prices.
- Whether investment will be encouraged or discouraged due to inflation depends upon whether inflation will lead to a rise in interest rates or not.
- If inflation is within the tolerance range, it may not cause an increase in interests and therefore may even encourage investment.
- If interest rates rise then the investment will be discouraged.

## Effects on Inflation on government and taxpayers: (at 10.10 AM)
- Price-wage spiral
- It is an effect or a phenomenon when an increase in prices leads to higher wages being negotiated by the workers and then these higher wages are passed on as higher prices of the goods.
- And so the prices and wages keep spiraling up.
- Fiscal drag:
- Fiscal drag is an economic term whereby inflation or income growth moves taxpayers into higher tax brackets.
- Fiscal drag is a result of decreased consumer spending as a result of increased taxation that eventually reduces aggregate demand, which leads to deflationary pressures.
- Progressive taxation, whereby individuals are moved into higher tax brackets because of inflation or increased income, is a fiscal policy that results in fiscal drag.
- Progressive taxation allows for increased government taxation without actually increasing taxes.
- The increase in taxes reduces aggregate demand and consumer spending from taxpayers as a larger share of their income now goes to taxes, which leads to deflationary policies, or drag, on the economy.
- Fiscal drag can be seen as an automatic fiscal stabilizer as it controls a rapidly expanding economy from overheating.
- Effects on Inflation on government and taxpayers:
- To understand the effect of inflation on taxes we look at the phenomenon of the fiscal drag.
- Inflation leads to people negotiating higher wages to shield themselves from the effects of inflation.
- They would desire an increment that is at least equal to the rate of inflation.
- However, when their incomes increase, some proportion of it goes to the government as taxes.
- Since the tax rate is almost always greater than the rate of inflation therefore from the increased income more proportion will be appropriated by the government in form of taxes as compared to the increase in the disposable income (disposable income is the amount of money that a person or household has to spend or save after income taxes are deducted) for the household.
- This is even more pronounced for those households which enter a higher tax bracket due to progressive taxation.
- Therefore, the increase in disposable income is not sufficient to shield from the effects of inflation despite a rise in income by a factor of the rate of inflation.
- The government collects more taxes without any change in the taxation policy.
- Inflation, thus, acts as a tax on the salaried.
- This phenomenon is fiscal drag and it is usually referred to as an automatic stabilizer.
- Due to an increase in tax outgo households realize that an increase in income is insufficient and therefore they ultimately cut down their consumption.
- This causes demand to subside and therefore the prices cool down.

## How to control inflation (Controlling inflation): (at 10.52 AM)
- We identify multiple factors (that is demand, supply, or other factors) that cause inflation and try to address those causes.
- Inflation at any point is due to multiple factors acting together.
- Some may even act in the opposite manner that is one factor may increase and the other factors may try to decrease the price.
- We try to identify the dominant factors which cause inflation and try to address them.
- Inflation is difficult to be addressed in the immediate term because of multiple structural factors behind it.
- It affects everybody in the immediate term.
- And therefore, the most important because it is convenient, the step taken to address inflation is the control of demand via monetary policy.

## Money, monetary policy and Banking: (at 11.16 AM)
Money:
- Money is a commodity accepted by general consent as a medium of economic exchange.
- It is the medium of exchange in which prices and values are expressed.
- It circulates from person to person and country to country, facilitating trade, and it is the principal measure of wealth.
- The rate of exchange will be determined on which how one person values another person's things/goods and how much another person values goods/things possessed by the first person.
- Money in the markets/economy is also required and the excess of money is also harmful to the markets/economy.
- To maintain balance with respect to the optimum amount of money in an economy we require a monetary authority.
- By accessing the status and working of money in the economy the monetary authority takes decisions according to balance the circulation of money.
- Properties of money as a medium of exchange:
- It is acceptable to all or most at almost any time. 
- Money is something that has its intrinsic value.
- Money (as a medium of exchange) retains its long-term values and does not deteriorate in value.
- It must be non-replicable, not counterfeit able, and control over it must be limited.
- It is easily stored relatively. 
- It has divisibility (the most essential property for a medium of exchange that is money) into small denominations.
- Availability (second most essential property for a medium of exchange that is money).
- NOTE: Gold is not used as money/medium of exchange (although gold fulfills most of the properties of the medium of exchange, in fact, Gold has been used significantly as a medium of exchange in the earlier/past times) because it has not had the properties of divisibility and also is limited in its availability.
## Currency:
- Currency is a modern form of money.
- Currency is a medium of exchange for goods and services.
- In short, it's money, in the form of paper or coins, usually issued by a government and generally accepted at its face value as a method of payment.
## Gold standard:
- The gold standard is a monetary system where a country's currency or paper money has a value directly linked to gold.
- With the gold standard, countries agreed to convert paper money into a fixed amount of gold.
- A country that uses the gold standard sets a fixed price for gold and buys and sells gold at that price.
- That fixed price is used to determine the value of the currency.
- The gold standard is not currently used by any government.
## Goldrush:
- Goldrush means the rapid influx of fortune seekers to the site of newly discovered gold deposits.
- Major gold rushes occurred in the USA (California Gold Rush of the 1840s and 1850s), Australia, Canada, and South Africa in the 19th century.
## Government bond:
- A bond is a debt instrument where the issuer (the borrower) is obligated to pay a fixed or floating interest rate and the principal during a fixed period of time.
- A government bond is a debt security issued by a government to support government spending and obligations.
- The guarantee given by the government is the most important guarantee.
- A government bond represents a debt that is issued by a government and sold to investors to support government spending.
- Government bonds can pay periodic interest payments.
These bonds issued by national governments are often considered low-risk investments since the issuing government backs them.
