## unequal representation of states in rajya sabha
(1.07 pm)
- arguments **against** present system of unequal representation on rajaya sabha:
	- smaller states feel that this system is discriminatory towards them. 
	- [[rajya sabha]] has become replica of [[lok sabha]].
	- [[united states of america]] is also a [[federation]] & provides equal representation in upper house.
- arguments in **favor** of present system of unequal representation on rajaya sabha:
	- equal representation will lead to more demand for several smaller states.
	- equal representation will lead to ever-expanding size for [[rajya sabha]].
	- equal representation will lead to stalling of rajya sabha by smaller states.
	- system of equal representation in rajya sabha will be discriminatory against large states with huge populations.
# lok sabha
(1.15 pm)
article 81 _[[a81]]_ :
composition of [[lok sabha]]
	no more than 530 members were chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in states.
	not more than 20 members to represent union territories, chosen in such manner as parliament provides by law.
	representation of anglo-indian [[community]] has not been extended under article 331 _[[a331]]_, thus maximum number of seats in lok sabha can be 550.
	by [[104th caa]], [[2019]] representation of anglo-indian community has been done away within lok sabha & state legislatures.
	currently, there are 543 seats in [[lok sabha]] as 7 seats are unassigned.
- article 81(2)(a):_[[a81]]_
	- seats allocated to states in [[lok sabha]] should be in such a manner that ratio b/w that number & population of state is, so far as practicable, same for all states.
- till [[2031]], census of [[1971]] will be used for allocating number of seats in lok sabha to states.
- census of [[1971]] is used instead of current census to ensure that [[population]] control measures of southern states do not become a drawback for them.
- article 81 (2) (b)
	- each state shall be divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that ratio b/w population of each constituency & number of seats allotted to it is, so far as practicable, same throughout state.
# duration of parliament

	- whether [[govt]] is appointing authority.
	- whether govt has power to terminate appointment.
	- whether govt determines remuneration.

## grounds for disqualification under anti-defection law
- for members of a political party:
	- if 1 voluntarily gives up membership of party.
		- if a person is suspended/expelled by political party then it will not be a ground of defection.
	- if a person votes or abstains from vote contrary to _whip_ of party.
	- a whip is instrument used by a political party to direct its members to either vote or abstain from voting.
- for independent members:
	- if independent members join a political party then liable for disqualification.
- for nominated members:
	- if nominated members belong to a political party then they continue to be part of that political party.
	- if nominated members don't belong to a political party but join a political party after 6 months of nomination then liable for disqualification.
- exemption to anti-defection law:
	- it does not apply to presiding officers in certain cases:
		- if presiding officer resigns from party he/she belongs to just before getting elected to office & does not rejoin party or not join any other political party during tenure in office.
		- if presiding officer rejoins political party he/she belonged to after demitting office.
- exemption in case of mergers of political parties:
	- 91st constitution amendment act [[91 caa]] provided that if at least 2/3 of members of a political party in house joins some other political party it would be exception under anti-defection law.
	- presiding [[officer]] of house decides on defection of a member & his/her decision is final.
# kihota hollohon vs. zachilhu case
- in this case, supreme court of india upheld constitutional validity of anti-defection [[law]].
- court stated that objective behind anti-defection law is to prevent corruption in [[politics]] & reduce role of [[money]] [[power]] in parliamentary proceedings.
- court held that law ensures stability of [[govt]] at [[center]] & state & therefore can be treated as exception to other provisions of [[constitution]].
- however, supreme court held that decision of presiding officer of house cannot be final & would be subject to [[judicial review]] of court that is part of basic [[structure]] of constitution.
- court also held paragraph 7 to be invalid not only on grounds of violating principle of judicial review but also because such a provision falls under [[proviso]] to article 386(2) [[a386]] & requires ratification by at least 1/2 of state legislature.
- there is no time limit for presiding officer to decide on case of anti-defection.
# arguments in favor of anti-defection law
