In Jainism, the word Śrāvaka or Sāvaga (from Jain Prakrit) is used to refer the Jain laity (householder). The word śrāvaka has its roots in the word śrāvana, i.e. the one who listens (the discourses of the saints).The tirthankara restores or organises the sangha, a fourfold order of muni (male monastics), aryika (female monastics),  śrāvakas (male followers) and śrāvikās (female followers).In Jainism, there are two kinds of votaries:

The householder (one with minor vows)

The homeless ascetic (one with major vows)

According to the Jain text Puruşārthasiddhyupāya:Ascetics who establish themselves in pure and absolute consciousness observe complete abstinence. Those who practice the path of partial abstinence are called Śrāvaka.

Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra, a major Jain text, discusses the conduct of a Śrāvaka in detail.
