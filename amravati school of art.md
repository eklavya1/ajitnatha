this school of art was developed at amaravati, on the banks of the [[krishna river]] and at [[nagarjunakonda]] in the guntur district of [[andhra pradesh]].
*flourished under the patronage of the satavahana rulers and shows the influence of both buddhism and jainism.*
the great stupa of [[amaravati]], which is the largest buddhist stupa of south india, is the best illustration of this school of [[art]].
the construction of the stupa began in 200 b.c. during the reign of ashoka and was completed in 200 a.d.
*the amaravati stupa has a lofty circular terrace with stairways.*
the railing and the dome are made of marble instead of red sandstone.
the stupa has rich engravings, comprising of slightly round, tall and slim figures.
buddha is generally represented by symbols, though figures are seen here and there.
*another important feature of the amaravati stupa is that there are no individual images; rather the preference is for scenes.*
at nagarjunakonda
	unlike the other schools of art, the amaravati school of art is *entirely indigenous and does not show any foreign influence*.
