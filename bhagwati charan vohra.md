Bhagwati Charan Vohra was born on November 15, [[1902]], in a very affluent family of Lahore in undivided Punjab known for its loyalty to the British Raj.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre which led to the death of hundreds of innocent Indians at the hands of British troops greatly agitated Vohra and he joined the anti-colonial struggle.
The Russian Revolution of 1917 also greatly influenced Vohra and other educated Indian youth like him.
They saw communism as a solution to India's poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, agrarian crisis and exploitative social conditions.
Vohra established contacts with the nascent Communist Party of India and started smuggling M.N. Roy's periodical, Vanguard, and other Marxist literature into India.
But soon he got disillusioned with the lack of initiative shown by the fledgling communists and instead got attracted to the underground armed resistance led by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).
In 1928, HRA transformed itself into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and got engaged in popular violent attacks on the British to attract youth to its fold.
Vohra and Yashpal bombed the special train carrying the viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, in [[1929]].
However on May 28, 1930, when he was testing a bomb on the banks of river Ravi in Lahore, the bomb accidentally exploded on his hand and he died on the spot. He was just 28.
The life of Bhagwati Charan Vohra is deeply entrenched with the history of two organisations which he co-founded with other revolutionaries,  namely the open mass organization Naujawan Bharat Sabha (NBS) (1926) and the underground organization, Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA) ([[1928]]).
o Vohra was the propaganda secretary of the Sabha and became president of the latter.
He co-authored the manifesto of the NBS and the HSRA and wrote another polemical essay titled 'Philosophy of Bomb' with Chandra Shekhar Azad and Yashpal.
