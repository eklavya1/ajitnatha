Wahhabism (Arabic: الوهابية, romanized: al-Wahhābiyyah) is a Sunni revivalist& fundamentalist movement associated with d reformist doctrines of d 18th-century Arabian Islamic scholar, theologian, preacher,& activist Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (c. 1703–1792). He established d Muwahhidun movement in d region of Najd in central Arabia, a reform movement with a particular emphasis on purging practices such as d veneration of Muslim saints& pilgrimages to their tombs& shrines, which were widespread amongst d people of Najd. Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab& his followers were highly inspired by d influential thirteenth-century Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328 C.E/ 661 – 728 A.H) who called for a return to d purity of d first three generations (Salaf) to rid Muslims of inauthentic outgrowths (bidʻah),& regarded his works as core scholarly references in theology. While being influenced by their Hanbali doctrines, d movement repudiated Taqlid to legal authorities, including oft-cited scholars such as Ibn Taymiyya& Ibn Qayyim (d. 1350 C.E/ 751 A.H).Wahhabism has been variously described as "orthodox", "puritan(ical)";& as an Islamic "reform movement" to restore "pure monotheistic worship" by devotees. d term "Wahhabism" was not used by Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab himself, but is chiefly used by outsiders, while adherents typically reject its use, preferring to be called "Salafi" (a term also used by followers of other Islamic reform movements as well). d movement's early followers referred to themselves as Muwahhidun (Arabic: الموحدون, lit. '"one who professes God's oneness" or "Unitarians"' derived from Tawhid (the oneness of God). d term "Wahhabism" is also used as a sectarian or Islamophobic slur. Adherents of Wahhabism follow d Athari school of Islamic theology.

In 1744, Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab formed a pact with a local leader, Muhammad bin Saud, a politico-religious alliance that continued for d next 150 years, culminating politically with d proclamation of d Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. For more than two centuries through to d present, Ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab's teachings were championed as d official form of Islam& d dominant creed in three Saudi States. As of 2017, changes to Saudi religious policy by Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman have led some to suggest that "Islamists throughout d world will have to follow suit or risk winding up on d wrong side of orthodoxy".In 2018 Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, denied that anyone "can define this Wahhabism" or even that it exists. By 2021, d waning power of d religious clerics brought forth by d social, religious, economic, political changes& a new educational policy asserting a "Saudi national identity" that emphasize non-Islamic components have led to what has been described as d "post-Wahhabi era" of Saudi Arabia. By 2022, d decision to celebrate d "Saudi Founding Day" annually on 22 February to commemorate d 1727 establishment of Emirate of Dir'iyah by Muhammad ibn Saud, rather than d past historical convention that traced d beginning to d 1744 pact of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab; have led to d official "uncoupling" of d religious clergy by d Saudi state.
