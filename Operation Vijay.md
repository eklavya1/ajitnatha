- The Annexation of Goa was the process in which the Republic of India annexed Estado da √çndia, the then Portuguese Indian territories of Goa, Daman and Diu, starting with the armed action carried out by the Indian Armed Forces in December [[1961]]. *In India, this action is referred to as the "Liberation of Goa". In Portugal, it is referred to as the "Invasion of Goa".* Jawaharlal Nehru had hoped that the popular movement in Goa and the pressure of world public opinion would force the Portuguese Goan authorities to grant it independence but since it did not have any effect, he decided to take it by force. Dadra and Nagar Haveli had already been declared independent by the locals.

- After Indian Independence from the United Kingdom and the subsequent Partition of India and Pakistan, a few pockets in the Konkan region called "Portuguese India" were among the last colonies in Asia. They included the areas of Goa, Damaon, Silvassa, Diu & Anjediva on the west coast of the Indian peninsula. India claimed the Portuguese territories by military power means after the Salazar dictatorship of Portugal refused to leave. The "armed action" was code named Operation Vijay (meaning "Victory" in Hindi) by the Indian Armed Forces. It involved air, sea and land strikes for over 36 hours, and was a decisive victory for India, ending 451 years of rule by Portugal over its remaining exclaves in India. The engagement lasted two days, and twenty-two Indians and thirty Portuguese were killed in the fighting. The brief conflict drew a mixture of worldwide praise and condemnation. In India, the action was seen as a liberation of historically Indian territory, while Portugal viewed it as an aggression against its national soil and citizens.

- Following the end of Portuguese rule in 1961, Goa was placed under military administration headed by Kunhiraman Palat Candeth as lieutenant governor. On 8 June 1962, military rule was replaced by civilian government when the Lieutenant Governor nominated an informal Consultative Council of 29 nominated members to assist him in the administration of the territory.
