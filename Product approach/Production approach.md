- In this approach, we calculate the values of goods produced in the economy.
- This is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- It refers to the total value of final goods produced in an economy in a given time period, usually a year.
- Market removes the ambiguity in “value”.
- We take the value of only those goods and services which can have a market value.
- Territory means economic territory.
**Stock and flow variable**
	(2.22 PM)
	- Stock - which is measured at a _point in time_.
	- Flow - which is measured at a _period of time_.

- Production method/ product approach
- In the production method, we estimate the value of goods produced in an economy. This is a direct measurement of GDP (Gross Domestic Product).
- GDP is defined as the value of final goods and services produced in an economy in a given time period usually a year.
- Value - it refers to the market value of a good i.e. only those goods and services are taken into account which has some objectively measurable market value.
- Eg- if a scientific discovery is made, it may not yet have a market value as it takes time to value intellectual property.
- Until there is a market value, the goods will not be a part of GDP.
- Similarly, services such as those provided without any monetary considerations like care given by parents are also not a part of the GDP.
- Similarly, trees planted may not have an objectively measurable market value.
- Hence, it would not be a part of GDP’s calculations.
- Final goods - the value of only final goods are used for GDP’s calculations purpose.
- Intermediate goods’ value is already a part of the value of the final goods. Hence, adding it again would cause double counting.
- Produced - Only the goods produced in the given time period are considered, not the goods sold.
- In an economy, meaning, we refer to the territorial boundary in which the goods are produced for considering them to be part of GDP.
- Eg- the embassies of India in foreign countries provide some service that has value.
- The value of those services even when provided in a foreign land will be included in India’s GDP because embassies’ are deemed a part of the domestic economic territory.
- In a given time period- GDP is a flow variable i.e. it is measured over a period of time rather than at a particular moment in time.
- We consider the value of goods produced in a given time period to calculate GDP rather than the value of goods existing at a moment of time.
