- The longue durée ([[French]] pronunciation: ​[lɔ̃ɡ dyʁe]; [[English]]: the long term) is an expression used by the [[French]] Annales School of historical [[writing]] to designate their approach to the study of history.[1] It gives priority to long-term historical structures over what François Simiand called histoire événementielle ("evental history", the short-term time-scale that is the domain of the chronicler and the journalist), concentrating instead on all-but-permanent or slowly evolving structures, and substitutes for elite biographies the broader syntheses of _prosopography_. The crux of the idea is to examine extended periods of time and draw conclusions from historical trends and patterns.
