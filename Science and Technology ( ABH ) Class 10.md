Science and Technology ( ABH ) Class 10

Class started at 1:15 pm

Discussion on last class topics 

Stealth-(1:18 pm )

The goal of stealth technology is to make a submarine/ship/airplane invisible to radars and sonars.
eg-Camouflage is a type of stealth.
This can be done in the following ways-
The airplane /ship can be shaped in a way that any radar signal it reflects is reflected away from radar equipment.
The airplane can be covered in materials that absorb radar signals.
Use of Radio Jammers.
Torpedo-These are underwater missiles that follow a straight path like a cruise missile .eg Varunastra by DRDO, and Maarich is a torpedo defense system and counter-measure system.

Naval warships-(1:54 pm)

They are of 4 categories -
Destroyer -Large warships equipped with missiles, torpedos, radars, sonars, and combat platforms .eg INS Kolkata, INS Visakhapatnam 
Frigates -They are smaller but faster than destroyers used as scout vessels to protect sea lines of communication or a component of a strike group.eg INS Shivalik,INS Talwar ,INS brahmaputra.
Corvets -These are battleships ranking below a frigate in size. They are used as a preparatory vessel in crucial war times offering required support to larger fleets, coastal patrolling, and participation in minor wars. eg INS Kamorta, INS Kavaratti
Aircraft Carriers -They are floating air bases in the sea mainly fighter aircraft operating from their desks. It is accompanied by destroyers, submarines to provide defense and support to the carrier's operation.
Aircraft's carriers use the following methods for take-off and recovery-
CATOBAR system (Catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery )-
It works like a catapult where the stored energy in the catapult is released and converted into kinetic energy. 
CATOBAR system can be powered by steam energy or by electromagnetic induction.
STOBAR system ( Short takeoff but arrested recovery )-
The frontal part of the deck is elevated and thus aircraft is assisted by a ski jump.

Fighter Craft-(2:23 pm)

eg Rafale, mirage from France, Sukhoi and Mig from Russia, Tejas (indigenous )2:23 pm
Tejas -(2:27 pm)-is an indigenous aircraft that is one of the lightest, smallest, multi-role, supersonic fighter aircraft in its class.
It carries a range of air to air, air to surface precision-guided weapons.
It has air to air refueling capability and can attain the speed of sound.

Break- (2:33pm to 2:53pm)

Contribution of Indians in science and technology. (2:55pm)

Dr. CV Raman - famous for Raman Spectroscopy 
Spectroscopy - used in chemical, pharmaceutical, electronic industry.
Can be used in the smaller samples to determine the chemical composition of any material.
It's very accurate, can determine very small changes.
It does not interfere with the property of the material.
Techniques of Spectroscopy are many.
Dictation - 3:39 pm 
Dr. CV Raman is known for the CV effect and Raman Spectroscopy.
When the light of some frequency is incident on a sample, the frequency of scattered photons increases or decreases compared to the original frequency.
This is called the Raman effect. Thus Raman effect is an example of inelastic scattering of photons after interaction with a sample.
DR Raman got a noble price in physics in 1930 for this discovery.
Advantages -
It is used for determining the chemical composition and structure of materials.
It can analyze a sample multiple times without any damage to the sample.
Even a very small amount of samples can be analyzed using it.
It is very sensitive to even small changes in material structure.
It is used almost on all types of materials.
Because of its precision and effectiveness, Raman spectroscopy has much application across various industries as well as research and development work.

Fundamental forces in nature (3:48 Pm)

4 forces- Gravitational force(GF)
Electromagnetic force (EF)
Strong interaction force(SF)
Weak interaction force (WF)
Increasing order of strength - GF
Range - GF and EF are long-range forces 
SF range is within the nucleus of an atom 
WF also operates at the nuclear level.
Both SF and WF are short-range forces.
Particles which has mass will be affected by Gravity and charged particles are affected by Electromagnetic force.
SF - affected particles are quarks and gluons 
WF- affected particles are fermions 
GF - responsible for the movement of stars, planets, and galaxies
EF- responsible for atoms and molecules.
SF- responsible for the stability of the nucleus.
WF- responsible for nuclear reaction in stars, beta radioactive dealy.
