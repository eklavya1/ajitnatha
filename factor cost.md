- **factor cost** or national income by type of income is a measure of national income or output based on the cost of factors of production, instead of market prices. This allows the effect of any subsidy or indirect tax to be removed from the final measure.The concept of factor cost is focusing on the cost incurred on the factor of production. It can be defined as the actual cost incurred on goods and services produced by industries and firms is known as factor costs. Factor costs include all the costs of the factors of production to produce a given product in an economy. It includes the costs of land, labor, capital and raw material, transportation etc. They are used to produce a given quantity of output in an economy. The factor cost does not include the profits made by the producing firms or industries or the tax which they incur on producing those goods and services. We can simply categorize it as the cost of producing a product from unfinished good to a semi finished good or a finished good up to the desired output level.
