- it is also referred to as the cool temperate western margins and is experienced in britain and the low lying areas of northwest europe.
- the mean annual temperature ranges between 5 to 15 degrees c and seldom rises beyond 18 degrees.
- it is characterized by high rainfall throughout the year owing to the cyclonic activity with the peak rainfall occurring during winter or autumn months.
- these areas are under the influence of westerlies and have warm summers.
- the dominant trees are the deciduous trees which shed their leaves in the winter to avoid frost and snow.
- they are the industrialized and advanced areas of the world.

- the cool temperate western margin (british type) climate

## distribution climate
- the cool temperate western margins are under the permanent influence of the westerlies all around the year.
- they are also regions of much cyclonic activity, typical of britain, and are thus said to experience the british type of climate.
- from britain, the climatic belt stretches far inland into the lowlands of north-west europe, including such regions as northern and western france, belgium, the netherlands, denmark,western norway, and also north-westem iberia.
- in the southern hemisphere, the climate is experienced in southern chile, tasmania, and most parts of new zealand, particularly in south island.
## temperature
- the mean annual temperatures are usually between 50c and 150c.
- the annual range of temperature is small. summers are, in fact, never very warm.
- monthly temperatures of over 180c even in mid-summer are rare.
## precipitation
- the british type of climate has adequate rainfall throughout the year with a tendency towards a slight winter or autumn maximum from cyclonic sources.
- since the rain-bearing winds come from the west, the western margins have the heaviest rainfall.
- the amount decreases eastwards with increasing distance from the sea.
## natural vegetation
- the natural vegetation of this climatic type is deciduous forest.
- the trees shed their leaves in the cold season.
- this is an adaptation for protecting themselves against the winter snow and frost.
- shedding begins in autumn, the 'fall' season, during which the leaves fall and are scattered by the winds.
- some of the more common species include oak, elm, ash, birch, beech, poplar, and hornbeam.
- unlike the equatorial forests, the deciduous trees occur in pure stands and have greater lumbering value from the commercial point of view.
- the deciduous hardwoods are excellent for both fuel and industrial purposes.
## economy
- the region differs from many others in its unprecedented industrial advancement.
- the countries are concerned with the production of machinery, chemicals, textiles, and other manufactured articles rather than agriculture, fishing, or lumbering, though these activities
- are well represented in some of the countries.
- fishing is particularly important in [[britain]], [[norway]], and british columbia.
- a very large part of the deciduous woodlands has been cleared for fuel, timber, or agriculture.
