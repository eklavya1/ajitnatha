phumdis are a series of floating islands, exclusive to the loktak lake in [[manipur]] state, in northeastern india. they cover a substantial part of the lake area and are heterogeneous masses of vegetation, soil and organic matter, in different stages of decay. the largest single mass of phumdi is in the southeastern part of the lake, covering an area of 40 km2 (15.4 sq mi). this mass constitutes the worldâ€™s largest floating park, named keibul lamjao national park. the park was formed to preserve the endangered eld's deer subspecies, called sangai in the meitei language, indigenous to this area.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

phumdis are used by the local people for constructing their huts for fishing and other livelihood uses, and are inhabited by about 4000 people.[5][8] athapums are artificial circular phumdis, built by the villagers as enclosures for fish farming; aquaculture has caused proliferation of the phumdis in the lake.[9][10][11]
