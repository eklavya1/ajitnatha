[[james prinsep]], a british antiquary and colonial administrator was the first person to decipher ashoka‚Äôs edicts. these ashoka‚Äôs inscriptions are the first tangible evidence of buddhism.
they were kept in public places and along trade routes so that the maximum number of people would read them. more than religious discourses, they talk about the moral duties of the people, how to conduct life, ashoka‚Äôs desire to be a good and benevolent ruler, and ashoka‚Äôs work towards this end.
there are¬†33 inscriptions in total and primarily classified into the following:

**Ashoka's Inscription Excerpt**
*Beloved of the Gods speaks thus: Twelve years after my coronation I started to have Dhamma edicts written for the welfare and happiness of the people, and so that not transgressing them they might grow in the Dhamma. Thinking: ‚ÄúHow can the welfare and happiness of the people be secured?‚Äù I give my attention to my relatives, to those dwelling far, so I can lead them to happiness and then I act accordingly. I do the same for all groups. I have honoured all religions with various honours. But I consider it best to meet with people personally.*

## wikipedia
the edicts of ashoka are a collection of more than thirty inscriptions on the pillars, as well as boulders and cave walls, attributed to emperor ashoka of the mauryan empire who reigned from 268 bce to 232 bce. ashoka used the expression dha·πÉma lipi (prakrit in the brahmi script: ëÄ•ëÄÅëÄ´ëÄÆëÄ∫ëÄßëÄ∫, "inscriptions of the dharma") to describe his own edicts. these inscriptions were dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day bangladesh, india, nepal, afghanistan and pakistan, and provide the first tangible evidence of buddhism. the edicts describe in detail ashoka's view on dhamma, an earnest attempt to solve some of the problems that a complex society faced. according to the edicts, the extent of buddhist proselytism during this period reached as far as the mediterranean, and many buddhist monuments were created.

these inscriptions proclaim ashoka's adherence to the buddhist philosophy. the inscriptions show his efforts to develop the buddhist dhamma throughout his kingdom. although buddhism as well as gautama buddha are mentioned, the edicts focus on social and moral precepts rather than specific religious practices or the philosophical dimension of buddhism. these were located in public places and were meant for people to read.

in these inscriptions, ashoka refers to himself as "beloved of the gods" (devanampiya). the identification of devanampiya with ashoka was confirmed by an inscription discovered in 1915 by c. beadon, a british gold-mining engineer, at maski, a village in raichur district of karnataka. another minor rock edict, found at the village gujarra in datia district of madhya pradesh, also used the name of ashoka together with his titles: "devanampiya piyadasi asokaraja". the inscriptions found in the central and eastern part of india were written in magadhi prakrit using the brahmi script, while prakrit using the kharoshthi script, greek and aramaic were used in the northwest. these edicts were deciphered by british archaeologist and historian james prinsep.the inscriptions revolve around a few recurring themes: ashoka's conversion to buddhism, the description of his efforts to spread buddhism, his moral and religious precepts, and his social and animal welfare program. the edicts were based on ashoka's ideas on administration and behaviour of people towards one  another  and religion.
