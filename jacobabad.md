- **jacobabad** (Urdu: جیکب آباد and Sindhi: جيڪب آباد; formerly Khanger or Khangarh) is a city in Sindh, [[Pakistan]], serving as both the capital city of Jacobabad District and the administrative center of Jacobabad Taluka, an administrative subdivision of the district. The city itself is subdivided into eight Union Councils. Sitting far to the northwest of the province, near the provincial boundaries of Sindh and Balochistan, Jacobabad became a city on the site of an existing village (Khangarh), and is crossed by the Pakistan Railways and many main roads of the province. It is the 43rd most populous city in Pakistan.
- The city is one of the hottest places on earth, with summer temperatures regularly rising to a mean temperature of 37 °C (99 °F). In particular, compounded by the humidity and climate char ange, Jacobabad has several times exceeded a wet-bulb temperature of 35 °C (95 °F), above which the human body cannot sufficiently cool itself. Jacobabad has been cited as one of the world's most vulnerable places to global warming, and one where the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C can be the difference between life and death.
