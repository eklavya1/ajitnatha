ite, missa est are the concluding latin words addressed to the people in the mass of the roman rite, as well as the lutheran divine service.   until the reforms of 1962, at masses without the gloria, benedicamus domino was said instead. the response of the people (or, in the tridentine mass, of the servers at low mass, the choir at solemn mass) is deo gratias ("thanks be to god").
