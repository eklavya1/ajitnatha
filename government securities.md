govt securities are govt debt issuances used to fund daily operations, and sp. infrastructure and military projects. 
they guarantee full repayment of invested principal at maturity of security and often pay periodic coupon or interest payments.
govt securities are considered to be risk-free as they have backing of govt that issued them.
trade-off of buying risk-free securities is that they tend to pay a lower rate of interest than corporate bonds.
investors in govt securities will either hold them to maturity or sell them to other investors on secondary bond market.

g-sec is a tradable instrument issued by central govt or state [[government]].
it acknowledges govemment's debt obligation.
such securities are short term (usually c/a treasury bills, with original maturities of less than 1 year- presently issued in 3 tenors, namely, 91 days, 182 days and 364 days) or long term (usually c/a
govemment bonds or dated securities with original maturity of 1 year or more).
in india, central govemment issues both treasury bills and bonds or dated securities while state govts issue only bonds or dated securities, which are c/a state development loans (sdls).
g-secs carry practically no risk of default and, hence, are c/a risk-free gilt-edged instruments.
gilt-edged securities are high-grade investment bonds offered by govts and large corporations as a means of borrowing funds.
