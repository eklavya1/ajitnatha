- **lithophyte**s are plants that grow in or on [[rock]]s. They can be classified as either epilithic (or epipetric) or endolithic; epilithic lithophytes grow on surfaces of rocks, while endolithic lithophytes grow in crevices of rocks (and are also referred to as chasmophytes).
- Lithophytes can also be classified as being either obligate or facultative. Obligate lithophytes grow solely on rocks, while facultative lithophytes will grow partially on a rock & on another substrate simultaneously.
