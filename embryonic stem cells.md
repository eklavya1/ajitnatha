most embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that develop from eggs that have been fertilized in vitro - in an [[in vitro]] fertilization (IVF) clinicâ€”and then donated for research purposes.
they are not derived from eggs fertilized in a woman's body.
## human embryonic stem cells
stem cells are undiffiated cells that are capable of dividing for long periods of time & can give rise to specialized cells under particular conditions.
embryonic stem cells are a particular type of stem cell-derived from embryos.
term "embryo" applies to a fertilized egg from beginning of division up to end of eighth week of gestation when embryo becomes a fetus.
these cells have 2 distinctive properties:
	pluripotency & ability to replicate indefinitely.
pluripotency means they are able to grow or diffiate into all derivatives of 3 primary germ layers:
	ectoderm, endoderm, & mesoderm.
in other words, they can develop into all cells of adult body.
## application
embryonic stem cell therapies have been proposed for regenerative medicine & tissue replacement after injury or disease.
es cell-derived cells can potentially be used to replace or restore tissues that have been damaged by disease or injury, such as diabetes, heart attacks, parkinson's disease, or spinal cord injury.
other potential uses of embryonic stem cells include investigation of early human development, study of genetic disease, & in vitro systems for toxicology testing.
b/c es cells can proliferate without limit & can contribute to any cell type, human es cells offer unprecedented access to tissues from human body.
