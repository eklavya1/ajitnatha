- distribution of [[income]] in an [[economy]]
- The Lorenz curve is a _graphical depiction of the extent of inequality in a country_.
- It represents the share of incomes held by a percentage of the population.
- If less proportion of the population holds more proportion of wealth, then there is inequality in the society.
- If the same proportion of wealth is held by exactly the same proportion of the population for any proportion of wealth, then there exists perfect equality.
- Note: This concept has been explained through a graph plotting the cumulative population on the X-axis and the cumulative share of income on the Y-axis.
- From the graph, it can be seen that the first 60% population holds only a 30% share of total income. This means the next 40% population holds the remaining 70% share. Therefore, there is inequality in society.
- Further, it can be seen that the last 10% of the population holds a 40% share in total incomes depicting that inequality is steep considering the large share of incomes earned by the top 10% population.
- For a country, the Lorenz curve lies between the lines of perfect equality and perfect inequality. Perfect equality depicts an equal share in income for all sections of the population whereas perfect inequality depicts just 1 person holding the entire income whereas all others hold exactly zero.
- A country that is more unequal will have a Lorenz curve further away from the line of perfect equality and closer to the line of perfect inequality.
