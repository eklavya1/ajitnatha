the congress socialist party (csp) was a socialist caucus within indian national congress. it was founded in [[1934]] by congress members who rejected what they saw as anti-rational [[mysticism]] of gandhi as well as sectarian attitude of communist party of india towards congress. influenced by [[fabianism]] as well as marxism-leninism, csp included advocates of armed struggle or sabotage (such as yusuf meherally, jai prakash narayan, & basawon singh (sinha) as well as those who insisted upon ahimsa or nonviolent resistance (such as acharya narendra deva). csp advocated decentralized socialism in which co-operatives, trade unions, independent farmers, & local authorities would hold a substantial share of economic power.
as secularists, they hoped to transcend communal divisions through class solidarity. some, such as narendra deva or basawon singh (sinha), advocated a democratic socialism distinct from both marxism & reformist social democracy. during popular front period, communists worked within csp.
