Discussion of prelims questions (1.10 PM)
Refer to the handout for questions.
Overview of the previous topics (1:27 PM)

Blockchain technology (1.35 PM) was discussed.

Dictation (1.57 PM)
Blockchains are open, distributed ledgers that can chronologically record transactions.
Every single transaction in the blockchain is linked using cryptographic principles.
The blocks are connected with a unique identifier code called hash that connects them to the previous and the subsequent blocks.
This forms a continuous ledger of transactions that is not owned by a single individual.
Each ledger is shared, copied, and stored on every computer connected to the system.
Because it uses cryptographic hashing proof of work system and the fact that, it is decentralized, a block once added cannot be manipulated later.
Such type of digital ledger has many benefits, such as:
A distributed database- records are truly public and easily verifiable.
Transparent and incorruptible- it cannot be corrupted as altering any unit of information would mean using a huge amount of computing power to override the entire network.
Enhanced security- there is no single entity that controls the blockchain and thus there is no single point of failure as data is not being held centrally.
When a new transaction is initiated on blockchain- it is broadcasted to the entire network and needs to be approved by the majority of nodes for the new block to be added.
Blockchain has been the backbone of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and even though there is huge debate surrounding utility of cryptocurrency there is a consensus on the utility of blockchain technology.
Potential areas of the blockchain (2.29 PM)
Blockchain can be used in many areas such as
designing smart contracts
IPR
Cyber security

National Identity Management System
Land Title Registration
Tax and revenue monitoring
Challenges in the adoption of blockchain technology (2.34 PM)
Lack of scalability
Lack of interoperability- how one blockchain will communicate with another blockchain.
Regulation
High cost and limited availability of skilled workforce
51% attack- An attack on a blockchain by a group of miners controlling over 50%.
So, if it is done, only the future entries can be changed.
The entries made in the past cannot be changed.

Cryptocurrency (3.13 PM)
it is a type of digital currency which is based on cryptographic principles. It is secured from counterfeiting
it is not issued by the central authority making it immune to government interference.
It uses blockchain technology as a distributed ledger. Eg- bitcoin, etherium, ripple, dodge coin etc.
Various benefits of cryptocurrency include
Difficult to counterfeit as compared to a physical one.

Anonymity
Immune to government-led financial manipulation.
It provides an alternative to banking systems and fiat currencies.

Issues associated with cryptocurrency (3.21 PM)

Use in illegal activities- money laundering, terror financing

Lack of interoperability
Highly volatile- the value of bitcoin has fluctuated between $5000 to $60000 just in 2-3 years.
Such volatility introduces instability in the market and economy.
Uncertainty over consumer protection and dispute settlement mechanism.
Absence of a well-defined legal framework for cryptocurrencies
Acceptance issues

Artificial intelligence (3.28 PM)

The topic is discussed.
Refer to the handout.

The topic for the next class: Internet, Data protection regime.
