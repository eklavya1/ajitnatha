- carbon sequestration is process of storing carbon in a carbon pool.: avii-54  carbon dioxide (co2) is naturally captured from atmosphere through biological, chemical, & physical processes. these changes can be accelerated through changes in land use & agricultural practices, such as converting crop land into land for non-crop fast growing plants. artificial processes have been devised to produce similar effects, including large-scale, artificial capture & sequestration of industrially produced co2 using subsurface saline aquifers, reservoirs, ocean water, aging oil fields, or other carbon sinks, bio-energy with carbon capture & storage, biochar, ocean fertilization, enhanced weathering, & direct air capture when combined with storage.
- likely need for cdr (carbon dioxide removal) has been publicly expressed by a range of individuals & organizations involved with climate change issues, including ipcc chief rajendra pachauri, unfccc executive secretary christiana figueres, & world watch institute. institutions with major programs focusing on cdr include lenfest center for sustainable energy at earth institute, columbia university, & climate decision making center, an international collaboration operated out of carnegie-mellon university's department of engineering & public policy.
