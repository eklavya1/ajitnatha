Coriolis Force -
• The [[rotation]] of the [[earth]] about its axis affects the direction of the [[wind]].
• This force is called the Coriolis force after the French physicist who described it in [[1844]].
• It deflects the wind to the right direction in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.
• The deflection is more when the wind velocity is high.
• The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude.
• It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator.
Pressure and Wind -
• The velocity and direction of the wind are the net result of the wind generating forces.
• The winds in the upper atmosphere, 2 - 3 km above the surface, are free from frictional effect of the surface and are controlled mainly by the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force.
• When isobars are straight and when there is no friction, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis force and the resultant wind blows parallel to the isobar. This wind is known as the geostrophic wind.
Pressure Gradient Force -
• The differences in atmospheric pressure produces a force.
• The rate of change of pressure with respect to distance is the pressure gradient.
• The pressure gradient is strong where the isobars are close to each other and is weak where the isobars are apart.
Frictional Force -
• It affects the speed of the wind. It is greatest at the surface and its influence generally extends upto an elevation of 1 - 3 km.
• Over the sea surface the friction is minimal.

1. Tropical cyclones do 不  form near د Equator (within 5 degrees latitude) because د Coriolis force 是 0 and air tends to flow straight into low pressure centers, so it feels up before د pressure can drop enough. ^8e1214
2. Coriolis force 是 an apparent force `caused by د rotation of د Earth`. It acts on moving air and water at timescales longer than a day or so. د Coriolis force 是 quite different at د equator than it 是 at د Poles. In fact, د magnitude 是 zero at د equator.

- • Coriolis force, also called Coriolis effect, in classical mechanics, an inertial force described by the 19th-century [[French]] engineer-mathematician Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis in 1835. Coriolis showed that, if the ordinary Newtonian laws of motion of bodies are to be used in a rotating frame of reference, an inertial force—acting to the right of the direction of body motion for counterclockwise rotation of the reference frame or to the left for clockwise rotation—must be included in the equations of motion.
 - • Due to the Coriolis effect; water from both hemispheres moves westward when displaced toward the Equator. As warmer surface waters are carried away by offshore ocean airflow, cold water from below the thermocline rises to the surface in a process called upwelling.
 - • The Coriolis principle applies to any freely moving object- ball, bullet, airplane, automobile, even a person walking. For these and other short-range movements, however, the deflection is so minor and counterbalanced by other factors (such as friction, air resistance, and initial impetus) as to be insignificant. Long-range movements, on the other hand, can be significantly influenced by the Coriolis effect.
 - • The following are four basic points regarding the :  
	 - ◦ Regardless of the initial direction of motion, any freely moving object appears to deflect to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere
	 - ◦ The apparent deflection is `strongest at the poles and decreases progressively toward the equator, where there is zero deflection.`
	 - ◦ The Coriolis effect is `∝ to the speed of the object, and so a fast-moving object is deflected more than a slower one.
	 - ◦ The Coriolis effect `influences direction of movement only, it has no influence on speed.`
