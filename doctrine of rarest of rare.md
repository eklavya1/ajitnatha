the doctrine of rarest of rare was established in case of bacchan vs. state of punjab.
the supreme court, in this case, endeavoured to cut out a doctrine particularly for offences culpable with death to decrease ambiguity for courts regarding when to go for highest punishment of land.

the constitutionality of death penalty was upheld by [[supreme court]] & a principle was laid down that death penalty must be surrounded only in "rarest of rare cases." however, scope of this phrase was left undefined.

the year [[2008]] accounted for case of prajeet kumar singh v. state of bihar, wherein court ruled exactly on what would constitute a "rarest of rare case."

the court held that a death sentence would be awarded only, "when a murder is committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense & extreme indignation of community.
since there is no statutory definition of what rarest of rare means, controversy arises each time when court awards death penalty.

later, in case of macchi singh v. state of punjab, court tried to lay down criteria for assessing whether a crime fell into category of "rarest of rare."
