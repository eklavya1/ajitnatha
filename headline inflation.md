It is the total inflation in an [[economy]].
The headline [[inflation]] figure includes inflation in a basket of goods that includes commodities like food and energy.
As it includes all aspects within an economy that experience inflation, headline inflation is not adjusted to remove highly volatile figures, including those that can shift regardless of economic conditions.
Headline inflation is often closely related to shifts in the cost of living, which provides useful [[information]] to consumers within the marketplace.
The headline figure is not adjusted for seasonality or for the often-volatile elements of food and energy prices, which are removed in the core [[Consumer Price Index]] (CPI).
Headline inflation is usually quoted on an annualized basis, meaning that a monthly headline figure of 4% inflation equates to a monthly rate that, if repeated for 12 months, would create 4% inflation for the year. Comparisons of headline inflation are typically made on a year-over-year basis, also known as top-line inflation.
