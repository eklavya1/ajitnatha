gave brief overview of previous class:(09:08:00 am)
## financial inclusion & bank nationalisation
financial inclusion & bank nationalisation:(09:16:00 am)

- in [[1950]]s almost 92% of total rural credit was given by non-institutional lenders (moneylenders).
- now almost 70% of total rural credit's lent by institutional institutes.
- earlier banks were not willing to lend to people from rural areas & people from small businesses due to risk involved.
- also in those days banks were limited to few urban areas & had very small presence in rural areas.

### financial inclusion has 4 pillars
1. part of formal financial system - it means having bank account through which 1 is associated.
2. availability of choices - that can be availed in banking services.(if only 1 product is available then person is in situation of "take or go home"
3. choices must be exercisable at affordable price & at desired time.
4. financial education: ability to decide which choice is most rational.
- through bank nationalization financial inclusion (fi) was sought to be achieved by increasing presence of banks on pan indibasis & making banking service available to [[population]].
- approach of financial inclusion was area-based. that is unbanked areas were targeted to open bank branches, further in those areas unbanked households were targeted.
- it was sought to be achieved through various measures such as opening of zero balance account, extending financial services through baking correspondents(bcs), lead bank scheme, regional rural bank.

- banking correspondent- is also c/bank mitra, who is person which takes banking services such as deposits & withdrawal facilities to population in unbaked area.
- he may perform related banking activities as well. however, it can not disburse loans, which are disbursed from branch only.

### regional rural banks
regional rural banks(rrbs)
- these are banks set up jointly by central govt, state govt, & sponsoring [[bank]] by contributing respectively 50%,15%, 35% of initial capital.
- process of setting up rrbs was started in [[1970]]s to further fi.
- now rrbs are being merged because number of rrbs increased beyond manageable.
### lead bank scheme
- [[bank]] is designated as leading bank in area/region. 
- this lead bank deliberates & draws plan along with other banks in region regarding how to further financial inclusion in given region.
- this is also area-based approach.
- regulation of rrbs:
- [[nabard]] was set up in [[1982]] as body to regulate rrbs.

- [[rbi]] regulates all banks, it's just that it has entrusted nabard with regulation of rrb.
- rbi lays down regulations & nabard is expected to ensure compliance of rrbs with those regulations.
- in [[1969]] only around 2% of population had bank account.
- in [[2011]], around 10~11 % population & around 25% of households had bank account.
- in [[2014]] pm jan dhan yojanlaunched 1 of most successful schemes for financial inclusion. 
- it changed approach from household & are to targeting unbanked population.
- within 2 years more than 90% of households & about 70% of population had bank account.
- govt ensures that these bank accounts remained active through transfer of benefits directly.
- this led to (& is continuing) to drive *behavioral change* in people regarding use of banking services.
- it's expected that when people use them, it leads to development of habit of savings, & from this, banks can objectively assess financial history of individual & therefore will be more inclined to give loans.

### priority sector lending
[[priority sector lending]] (psl) (10:31:00 am)
- banks are required to give at least 40% anbc ([[aggregate net bank credit]]) to priority sectors like agriculture, msmes, renewable energy, etc.
**shortfall in psl -**
- if bank falls short of psl target there are 2 options:
1. bank can invest in rural infrastructure development fund (ridf) of nabard.
- on this banks receive fixed 8% interest rate.
- this is biggest source of funds for nabard to achieve its goals of rural development.
- nabard lends to other banks which in turn lends for rural developments.
2. buy psl certificates from another bank that has exceeded its psl target.
- these certificates help banks to meet their psl targets.
- there are no discounted loans in psl. these loans are given at market rates only.
- if govt wants to give loans at cheaper rates to people govt has to bear cost of subsidized rates.
- psl certificates are traded at market rates.

## structure of banks -
(10:58:00 am)
- structure means size & presence of banks.
- structures of banks in indiare such that we have either:
- some very large banks:
	- present on pan indilevel
	- ex, SBI, PNB.
- many large banks:
	- these are also pan-indian basis.
	- but has more presence in some areas than others.
	- ex, allahabad bank.
- some small banks:
	- they also tend to have presence on pan-indian basis but have very sparse presence & many areas.
	- due to this structure, banking efforts are concentrated only in few areas like in urban areas but rural areas don't have such banking penetration.
	
- to correct this structure there were 2 narsimhan committees were established.
- this committee suggested that we should have -
1. few big banks at national level.
	they should be able to compete at global level.
2. 8 to 10 large regional banks.
	they should be able to compete at national level & meet demands at regional levels.
3. large number of small banks/local area banks.
	they should meet demands of general population.
- *this type of structure is actually present in all advanced or developed countries.*
- we need big banks to compete at global level. for ex, sbi which is largest bank of country at world level is at 48th rank!
- due to this, our banks can not offer globally competitive interest rates.
- we are moving in this direction by merging small banks & designating some banks as domestic systemically important banks (d-sibs).

### domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs)
(11:35:00 am)
- these are banks that are considered very important for overall health of financial system.
- termed as "**too big to fail**" as their failure will have very high adverse impacts on overall economy. [[netflix the big short]]
- currently, SBI, ICICI bank, & HDFC bank are D-SIBs designated by RBI.
- once bank is designated as d-sib so now it has to be under greater check & has to follow greater regulatory compliance to avoid any undesirable or corrupt practice at that bank to avoid its failure in future as it's now very important for economy as whole. [[plato]]
