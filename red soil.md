red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in eastem & southern part of deccan plateau.
along piedmont zone of westem ghats, a long stretch of area is occupied by red loamy soil.
yellow & red soils are also found in parts of odisha & chhattisgarh & in southern parts of middle ganga plain.
soil develops a reddish colour due to a wide diffusion of iron in crystalline & metamorphic rocks.
it looks yellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.
fine-grained red & yellow soils are normally fertile, whereas coarse-grained soils found in dry upland areas are poor in fertility.
they are generally poor in nitrogen, phosphorous & humus.
