immune systems. This dampened response could be an adaptation to the stress of flight which causes cells within bats’ bodies to break down and release bits of DNA. Ordinarily, these cell fragments would cause inflammation, but thanks to the bat’s weakened immune system they don’t. The hypothesis is that the same response that protects bats from inflammation from cell debris also stops them from becoming sick when infected with foreign viruses — location: [309]()
