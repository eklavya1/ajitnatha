haze is traditionally atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, & other dry particulates obscure clarity of sky. world meteorological organization manual of codes includes a classification of horizontal obscuration into categories of fog, ice fog, steam fog, mist, haze, smoke, volcanic ash, dust, sand, & snow. sources for haze particles include farming (ploughing in dry weather), traffic, industry, & wildfires.

seen from afar (e.g. approaching airplane) & depending on direction of view with respect to sun, haze may appear brownish or bluish, while mist tends to be bluish grey. whereas haze often is thought of as a phenomenon of dry air, mist formation is a phenomenon of humid air. however, haze particles may act as condensation nuclei for subsequent formation of mist droplets; such forms of haze are k/a "wet haze."

in meteorological literature, word haze is generally used to denote visibility-reducing aerosols of wet type. such aerosols commonly arise from complex chemical reactions that occur as sulfur dioxide gases emitted during combustion are converted into small droplets of sulfuric acid. reactions are enhanced in presence of sunlight, high relative humidity, & stagnant air flow. a small component of wet-haze aerosols appear to be derived from compounds released by trees, such as terpenes. for all these reasons, wet haze tends to be primarily a warm-season phenomenon. large areas of haze covering many thousands of kilometers may be produced under favorable conditions each summer.
