## money supply
[9:05 am]
- measures of money supply
- creation of money- creation by rbi & banking system
- control of money supply- monetary policy
- evaluation of monetary policy

### creation of money in economy
[10:22 am]

- creation of money by rbi
- rbi creates money in 2 stages -
1. printing
2. buying assets

- [[RBI]] prints currency notes which depict a promise by rbi to pay bearer sum printed on that ‘note’.
- rbi cannot simply introduce money by just printing it. rbi prints a [[currency]] note & that note carries a promise.
- that note will enjoy trust of economy & be used for transaction purposes only when [[economy]] is assured that rbi will be able to uphold its end of promise that promises to pay bearer sum printed.
- currency note thus is rbi’s liability. against these currency notes, rbi buys assets from market.
- there are only a few designated assets which it can buy, & only from a few designated entities in a very specific manner.
- buying assets increases assets of rbi, whereas buying them by issuing currency (which is a liability ), increases liability of rbi.

- currency notes are legal tenders- a legal tender is something that can be used as an instrument to repay [[debt]].
- a currency note cannot be refused by anyone to accept payment. it is also an example of [[fiat money]].
- fiat money is something that is used as money by an order of some authority. it is not used as a medium of exchange because of some intrinsic value. rather it is only because of authorities’ order that it is being used as money.

### rbi balance sheet
asset


liability

gold
	

currency in circulation

government bonds (center & states)
	

deposits with rbi of banks & center & state governments

foreign govt bonds
	

money borrowed by rbi from banks & governments

foreign currency assets
	
## lending by rbi to government & banks etc
- m0 (total liabilities of rbi)-high powered money
- *rbi creates high-powered money, m0* which is defined as total liabilities of rbi. from this high-powered money, [[banking]] system creates more money through a multiplier process.

## rbi’s transfers to government
- liabilities if rbi is either zero cost or very low cost. a currency note i.e. a promise by rbi to pay printed sum does not carry any interest.
- if rbi incurred liability in some years via currency note, liability of rbi will remain limited to that amount only forever.
- when one presents currency note to rbi & asks rbi to fulfill its promise, rbi simply will issue another currency note in return or give currency notes of lesser denomination- basically what rbi says is that you can take this currency note to anybody who is selling goods of [[value]] & we will ensure that these [[currency]] notes are accepted by that person to sell you those goods & services.
- [[rbi]] is thus asserting its *authority* that this currency note is acceptable *legal tender*. --> [[demonetization]]
- other [[liability|liabilities]] of rbi are very low in quantum & [[rbi]] pays a zero or very low interest on them.
- on other hand assets of rbi are either interest-earning or appreciating therefore rbi earns an income.
- from this income, rbi meets its expenses such as in printing of currency notes, payment of salaries, maintenance, operational [[expenditure]], etc.
- out of remaining amount, under recommendation of [[bimal jalan committee]], rbi takes out some contingency reserves i.e. [[money]] that may be required to meet some contingency requirements.
- [[money]] leftover is rbi’s [[surplus]] & this [[money]] is transferred to [[government]] by rbi in totality.
## money creation by banking system
[11:05 am]
m=m x m0 [[yuval noah harari]] [[=sapiens]]

$$M=m\times M0$$

m= money multiplier

M=money supply

M0= high powered money

m=currency & deposits

- banking system creates more money from what was injected into economy by rbi i.e. m0

- banking system by virtue of its operations of taking deposits & lending that money creates more money in economy.
- broadly process is as follows:

- bank receives deposits from p1. this deposit amount belongs to p1, which is equal to present amount of money in economy. from this banks set-asides some reserves. “ratio of reserves to deposits is called rdr”. [[reserve deposit ratio]]

- after [[accounting]] for reserves, remaining [[money]] is lent by [[bank]] to p2.
- p2 spends this money on buying goods from p3. when p3 receives this money, this money is now p3’s money.
- p3 may keep some proportion of this money as currency & remaining portion will be deposited in bank.
- money [[supply]] in [[economy]] which was only p1’s money initially has gone up by amount that p3 has, in form of [[currency]] as well as deposits.
- process does not end here. from p3’s money bank will again set-asides some reserves & lend remaining amount to p4.
- p4 spends it to buy goods from p5. p5 keeps some parts as currency & deposits remaining.
- money supply in [[economy]] has gone up further by which in form of currency as well as deposits. bank will again set aside reserves & lend & thus process keeps ongoing.

- in each round of lending, spending, & receiving deposits magnitude of money created reduces as banks have to set aside reserves & person receiving money splits it in form of currency & deposits & therefore banks do not receive entire amount of money they had lent in next round in form of deposits.
- since process goes on with a decreasing magnitude in each round, eventually process of money creation comes to a halt.
- total amount of money that is there in economy now is “money supply” which is greater than initial amount of money in economy.

- m=m x m0

- money multiplier (m): it is factor by which high powered money is multiplied to create money supply in economy.
- m is inversely proportional to “reserve deposit ratio”.
- m=1+cdr/cdr+rdr
- if rdr increases then more amount of money will have to be set aside for reserves & thus less would be available to be lent. therefore money creation process will come to a halt earlier.
- similarly, if cdr is high, banks will receive them back, less amount of money in form of deposits because people will keep more 
- currency. therefore, lending amount would be lesser & thus money multiplier process would come to a halt quickly.

## reserve deposit ratio
[[reserve deposit ratio]] (rdr):- reserves/deposit

- banks are required to maintain reserves based on how much money will depositors demand from their deposits.
- **this cannot be left only to banks to decide for themselves as if banks decide themselves, then they would be inclined to lend more [[money]] rather than keeping it to meet depositor's demand.**

- rbi sets this regulation in form of crr & SLR [[statutory liquidity ratio]] (to be covered later)

- these regulations are set to prevent situation of *bank run*. a bank run is a situation in which people lose trust in [[banking]] system as they feel banks will not be able to fulfill their obligations wrt their deposits. therefore, everybody rushes to bank to withdraw their money. since bank has already lent most of this money, it cannot fulfill its obligation wrt depositors. & thus there is collapse of trust in baking system.

## currency deposit ratio
[[currency deposit ratio]] cdr

## spread
- profits of bank = lending rate - deposit rates
