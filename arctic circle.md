- the arctic circle is one of the two polar circles and the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of earth. the arctic circle is special because it marks the point where, on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, the sun will not rise all day, and on the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the sun will not set. these are referred to as polar night and midnight sun respectively, and the further north one progresses, the more pronounced these effects become. for example, in the russian port city of murmansk, just 3º above the arctic circle, the sun does not rise for 40 days straight in the winter.

as seen from the arctic, the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon). this is also true in the antarctic region, south of the equivalent antarctic circle.

the position of the arctic circle is not fixed and currently runs 66°33′49.0″ north of the equator. its latitude depends on the earth's axial tilt, which fluctuates within a margin of more than 2° over a 41,000-year period, owing to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the moon. consequently, the arctic circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 14.5 m (48 ft) per year.
