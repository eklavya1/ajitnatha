Bannerghatta National Park's Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) will remain at 169 sq. km. despite thousands of citizens formally objecting to the reduction of nearly 100 sq. km. as compared to the original proposal.
Bannerghatta National Park is located near Bangalore, Kamataka in the hills of the Anekal range.
The park is part of a wildlife corridor for elephants that connects the BR Hills and the Sathyamangalam forest.
The park is contiguous with Talli reserve forest in the southeast and Bilikal forest in the south.
It was declared as a National Park in [[1974]].
In [[2002]] a portion of the park, became a biological reserve, the Bannerghatta Biological Park. It is the first biological park in India to have a fenced forested elephant sanctuary.
In [[2006]], India's first butterfly enclosure was inaugurated at the park.
