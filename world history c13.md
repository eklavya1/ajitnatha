## fascism in italy
(01:07:00 pm)
(explained by ppts)
whenever there is any economic/financial crisis there are very high chances of birth of fascism/communism.
1870s unification italy taken place.
world war was very costly leading to a poor economy, etc.
whenever there is any opposition/rationality it was crushed to "make nation great".
mussolini came to  power in [[1922]]  b/c of various factors:
territory promised in wwi was not given.
poor economy  b/c of war & lack of energy security & high inflation coupled with high unemployment.
system of proportional representation from [[1919]] to [[1922]]:
it says political parties allocated seats as per their % share in legislature.
b/c of this difficult to get a majority for 1 party. this led to falling of govt multiple times from [[1919]] to [[1922]].
it caused a lack of trust among people for politicians.
there were violent communist actions & there were many soviets like organizations, no security of properties.
factories were occupied by unions or workers/laborers.
then in [[1921]] communist party is established.
so there was fear in propertied class, kings, & church.
at this time mussolini starts writing & giving speeches that if given support he will stop communist people & will make country great.
[[1924]] election held & mussolini's party formed govt with a majority.
constitution was amended to give more power & power was centralized & role of parliament was reduced.
size of electorate was reduced by giving voting rights to only rich & powerful.
one-party state. so ultimately democracy was weakened.
censorship of media, educational system was supervised.

features of fascism:(03:40:00 pm)

reduction in powers of parliament & establishment of a strong executive that was usually done by amending constitution.
estalbilshmnet of a totalitarina regime.:
executive made nonresponsible to parliament.
dictatorial powers with executives & end of system of checks & balances.
removal of political opposition by setting up a one-party state by banning all other political parties.
one supreme leader who is usually charismatic & establishes a cult of personalities by taking titles, by great oratory, & media propaganda.
state comes to control economy by establishing a corporative state where:
a. state can give directions to private sector.
b. ban on strikes & lockouts & trade unions.
c. state creates a common body having representation of workers & capitalist class to resolve disputes with state mediation.
d. therefore fascist leaders are pro-capitalism but it's state which has a dominant role in economy ie capitalistic economy but not free-market economy.
destruction of democracy at local levels. for ex end of elections at state levels where govt is run by handpicked officials.
state control over media & no freedom of speech & expression & primary role of media is to glorify leader & do propaganda for state & no criticism of leader & his policies are allowed.
state control over education system with goal of indoctrination of students & youth.
change in curriculum in favor of ideology of leader & party.
monitoring of educational institutes by secrete police.
overall goal of fascism is to build a great nation which has:
a. self-sufficient economy.
b more exports & fewer imports.
c. minimum unemployment.
d. military superiority.
e. becoming a regional & world power.
to achieve goal of great nation there is a focus on unity among all classes & sections so everyone contributes to nation-building even if it's via forced coordination.
fascism adopts aggressive foreign policy including war as a tool of foreign policy to achieve foreign policy goals.
therefore extreme nationalism, cult of 1 supreme leader, lack of democracy, & aggressive foreign policy are key features of fascism.

## reasons for rise of fascism
(04:01:00 pm)
1. economic crisis:
ex: mussolini(wwi), hitler & in japan (great depression [[1929]])
2. a strong culture of nationalism & lack of democracy: in germany, japan, & italy.
3. sense of humiliation or deprivation in nation:
ex, in italy due to promise of territories being breached, in germany humiliation was caused by treaty of versailles.
4. fear of communism: communism was linked to violent/brutal overthrow of capitalism.
fascists projected themselves as savior of capitalism & therefore got support.
ex, fear of communist revolution in italy, in japan post great depression.
5. policy of appeasement as ht world tolerated their fascist policies.
