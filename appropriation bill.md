- an appropriation , also known as supply bill or spending bill, is a proposed law that authorizes the expenditure of government funds. it is a bill that sets money aside for specific spending. in most democracies, approval of the legislature is necessary for the government to spend money.

in a westminster parliamentary system, the defeat of an appropriation bill in a parliamentary vote generally necessitates either the resignation of a government or the calling of a general election. one of the more famous examples of the defeat of a supply bill was the 1975 australian constitutional crisis, when the senate, which was controlled by the opposition, refused to approve a package of appropriation and loan bills, prompting governor-general sir john kerr to dismiss prime minister gough whitlam and appoint malcolm fraser as caretaker prime minister until the next election (where the fraser government was elected).
