Viruses require a growth medium containing living cells, therefore, cannot be cultured in any synthetic medium.
Viruses are transmitted from one organism to another not only by biological vectors but also by mechanical vectors.
Mechanical vector like an arthropod vector which transmits an infective organism from one host to another but it is not essential to the life of cycle of the parasite.
Viruses are obligate parasites. Once they infect a cell, they take over the machinery of the host cell to replicate themselves, killing the host.
The name virus that means venom or poisonous fluid was given by *Pasteur*.
In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, which could be either RNA or DNA.

Viruses that infect plants have single-stranded RNA & Viruses that infect animals have either single or double-stranded RNA or double- stranded DNA
Bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) are usually double-stranded DNA viruses.
The protein coat called *capsid* made of small subunits called capsomeres protects the nucleic acid.
These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral geometric forms.
