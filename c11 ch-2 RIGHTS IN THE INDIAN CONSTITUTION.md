 # د 重要ANCE 的 RIGHTS
In 1982 during د construction work 为 Asian Games د 政府 engaged a 少 contractors. 这些 contractors employed a 大 number 的 很 poor construction workers من 不同 分s 的 د 国 إلى build د flyovers 和 stadiums. 这些 workers were kept 里 poor working conditions 和 were paid less than د minimum wages decided 被 د 制度. A team 的 social scientists studied dr poor condition 和 petitioned د sc . د y argued 这 employing a person إلى work 为 less than د minimum prescribed wage amounts إلى begar 或 forced labour, / 是 a violation 的 د Fundamental Right 反 exploitation. د 法院 accepted 这 plea 和 directed د 政府 إلى ensure 这 千s 的 workers get د prescribed wages 为 dr work. Machal Lalung 过 23 when 他 过 arrested. A resident 的 *Chuburi village 的 Morigaon district 的 Assam,* Machal 过 charged 的 causing grievous injuries. 他 过 found mentally 也 unstable إلى stand trial 和 过 sent as _ trial إلى Lok Priya Gopinath Bordoloi Mental Hospital 里 Tejpur 为 treatment. Machal 过 treated successfully 和 doctors wrote twice إلى jail authorities 里 1967 和 1996 这 他 过 fit إلى stand trial. But 不 one paid any attention. Machal Lalung remained 里 “judicial custody.’’ Machal Lalung 过 released 里 July 2005. 他 过 77 د n. 他 spent 54 年s _ custody during / his case 从不 came up 为 hearing. 他 过 freed when a team appointed 被 د National Human Rights Commission intervened 以后 an inspection 的 _ trials 里 د State.

Machal’s entire life 过 wasted because a proper trial 反 him 从不 took place. Our 宪法 给s 每 citizen د right إلى ‘life 和 liberty’: 这 means 这 每 citizen must 也 有 د right إلى fair 和 speedy trial. Machal’s case shows what happens when rights granted 被 د 宪法 是 不 available 里 practice.

==What if Machal 过 a rich 和 powerful man? What if those working 跟 د construction contractor were engineers? Would dr rights 有 been violated?
==

In د case 的 د first instance 也 د re 过 violation 的 rights provided 里 د 宪法. But 它 过 challenged 里 د 法院 . As a result, workers could get what 过 due إلى د m 里 د form 的 dr rightful wages. د 宪法al guarantee 的 د right 反 exploitation ensured justice إلى 这些 workers. Bill 的 Rights
Both 这些 examples show د 重要ance 的 有ing rights 和 的 د actual implementation 的 这些 rights. A 民主 must ensure 这 individuals 有 certain rights 和 这 د 政府  会  always recognise 这些 rights. د refore 它 是 often a practice 里 most 民主ic countries إلى list د rights 的 د citizens 里 د 宪法 itself. Such a list 的 rights mentioned 和 protected 被 د 宪法 是 called د ‘bill 的 rights’. A bill 的 rights prohibits 政府 من thus acting 反 د rights 的 د individuals 和 ensures a remedy 里 case د re 是 violation 的 这些 rights.

From whom does a 宪法 protect د rights 的 د individual? د rights 的 a person may be threatened 被 ano د r person 或 private organisation. 里 such a situation, د individual would need د protection 的 د 制度. So, 它 是 necessary 这 د 政府 是 bound إلى protect د rights 的 د individual. 上 د 其他 hand, د organs 的 د 政府 ( د  legislature, executive, bureaucracy 或 even د judiciary), 里 د course 的 dr functioning, may violate د rights 的 د person.
 fr 里 د 印度 宪法
During our 自由 struggle, د leaders 的 د 自由 movement had realised د 重要ance 的 rights 和 demanded 这 د British rulers should respect rights 的 د 人 . د Motilal Nehru committee had demanded a bill 的 rights as far back as 里 1928. 它 过 د refore, natural 这 when [[india]] 变得 independent 和 د 宪法 过 being prepared, د re were no

# Bill 的 rights 里 د 南 African
宪法
 د  南 African 宪法 was inaugurated 里 December 1996. Its creation 和 promulgation took place at a time when 南 Africa still faced د threat 的 a civil war
after د dissolution 的 د Apar د id
制度. د 南 African
宪法 says 这 its “Bill of
Rights 是 a cornerstone 的 民主 
in 南 Africa”. 它 forbids
discrimination 上 د grounds of
“race, gender, pregnancy, marital
status, ethnic 或 social origin,
colour, age, disability, religion,
conscience, belief, culture, language
and birth”. 它 grants perhaps د 
most extensive range 的 rights إلى د 
citizens. A special 宪法al
 法院 enforces د rights enshrined
in د 宪法.
Some 的 د Rights included in
 د  宪法 的 南 Africa
include:
± Right إلى Dignity
± Right إلى Privacy
± Right إلى fair labour practices
± Right إلى healthy environment 和 right إلى protection 的 environment
± Right إلى adequate housing
± Right إلى health care, food, 水 and social security
± Children’s rights
± Right إلى basic 和 higher 教学 
± Right 的 cultural, religious and linguistic communities
± Right إلى information


 二 opinions 上 د inclusion 和 protection 的 rights 里 د 宪法. د 宪法 listed د rights 这 would be specially protected 和 called د m ‘fr’. د  word fundamental suggests 这 这些 rights 是 so 重要 这 د 宪法 has separately listed د m 和 made special provisions 为 dr protection. د ==Fundamental Rights 是 so 重要 这 د 宪法 itself ensures 这 不 是 violated 被 د 制度.==

fr 是 different من 其他 rights available إلى us. While ordinary legal rights 是 protected 和 enforced 被 ordinary law, fr 是 protected 和 guaranteed 被 د 宪法 的 د country. Ordinary rights may be changed by د legislature 被 ordinary process 的 law making, but a fundamental right may 只 be changed 被 amending د 宪法 itself. Besides this, no organ 的 د 政府 能  act 里 a manner 这 violates  د m. As we shall study below 里 这 chapter, judiciary has د 力s 和 responsibility إلى protect د fr من violations 被 actions 的 د 
 30
 
制度. Executive as well as legislative actions 能  be declared
illegal 被 د judiciary if 这些 violate د fr or restrict د m 里 an unreasonable manner. ==However, fundamental rights 是 不 absolute 或 unlimited rights.== 政府 能  put reasonable restrictions 上 د exercise 的 our fr.
 
# RIGHT إلى EQUALITY
Consider د following 二 situations. 这些 是 imaginary situations. But similar things do happen 和 能  happen. Do 你 think  د y involve violation 的 fr?

 [[indian constitution#16]]==Article 16 (4): 不 hing 里 这 article shall prevent د 国 من making any provision 为 د reservation of appointments 或 posts 里 favour 的 any backward class 的 citizens which, 里 د  opinion 的 د State, 是 不 adequately represented 里 د services _ د State.==

 د se 是 examples 的 clear discrimination. 里 one instance د discrimination 是based 上 caste 和 in ano د r 它 是 based 上 gender. Do 你 think 这 such discrimination 是 justified? Right إلى equality tries إلى do away 跟 such 和 o د r discriminations. 它 provides 为 equal access إلى public places like shops, hotels, places 的 entertainment, wells, bathing ghats 和 places 的 worship. د re cannot be any discrimination 里 这 access 上 د grounds 只 of religion, race, caste, sex, 或 place 的 birth. 它 也 prohibits any discrimination 里 public employment 上 any 的 د above mentioned basis. 这 right 是 很 重要ant because our society did 不 practice equal access 里 د past.

 د  practice 的 untouchability 是 one 的 د crudest
manifestations 的 inequality. 这 has been abolished
_ د right إلى equality. د same right 也 provides
that د 国 shall confer 不 title 上 a person except those
who excel  د mselves 里 military 或 academic field. Thus
right إلى equality strives إلى make 印度 a true  民主 
by ensuring a sense 的 equality 的 dignity 和 status
among 都 its citizens.
 
 有 你 read د Preamble إلى our 宪法?
 
How does 它 describe equality? 你  会  find 这 د Preamble mentions 二 things abt equality: equality _Do such things really happen 里 our country? 或 是 这些 purely imaginary?_
 33
的 status 和 equality 的 opportunity. Equality 的 opportunity means that 都 sections 的 د society enjoy equal opportunities. But 里 a society where د re 是 various kinds 的 social inequalities, what does equal opportunity mean? د 宪法 clarifies 这 د government 能 implement special schemes 和 measures 为 improving د conditions 的 certain sections 的 society: children,women, 和 د socially 和 教学 ally backward classes. 你 may 有 heard abt ‘reservations’ 里 jobs, 和 里 admissions. 你 would 有 wondered why د re 是 reservations if we follow د principle 的 equality. 里 fact Article 16(4) 的 د 宪法 explicitly clarifies 这 a policy like reservation  会  不 be seen as a violation 的 right إلى equality. If 你 see د spirit 的 د 宪法, 这 是 required 为 د fulfilment 的 د right إلى equality 的 opportunity.
 
 ## 你 是 د JUDGE
You 有 received a postcard from Hadibandhu, who identifies himself as a “member 的 د dalit community” 里 Puri district 里 Odisha. Men من 这 community refused إلى follow a custom 这 required  د m إلى wash د feet 的 د groom and guests 的 د ‘upper caste’ during marriage ceremonies. 里 revenge, four women from this community were beaten up and ano د r 过 paraded naked. د postcard writer says “Our children 是 educated and  د y 是 不  会 ing إلى do د customary job 的 washing د feet of upper caste men, clear د left-overs 以后 د marriage feast and wash د utensils.” Assuming 这 د facts 给n above 是 correct, 你 有 إلى decide: Does 这 case involve violation 的 fr? What would 你 order د 政府 إلى do 里 这 case?
 
 34
 
 _Does 它 mean 这 里 some cases someone’s life 能  be taken away by law? 这 sounds strange. Can 你 think 的 an example?_
 
# RIGHT إلى FREEDOM
Equality 和 自由 或 liberty, 是 د 二 rights that are most essential إلى a  民主 . 它 是 不 possible to think 的 د one 跟 out thinking 的 د o د r. Liberty means 自由 的 thought, expression 和 action. However it does 不 mean 自由 إلى do anything 这 one desires or likes. If 这 were إلى be permitted د n a 大 number  的 人  会  不 be able إلى enjoy dr freedom. د refore, freedoms 是 defined 里 such a manner 这 每 person  会  enjoy her 自由 跟 out threatening 自由 of o د rs 和 跟 out endangering د law 和 order situation.

# Right إلى life 和 personal liberty
 د  foremost right 中 rights إلى 自由 是 د right to life 和 personal liberty. 不 citizen 能  be denied his or her life except 被 procedure as laid down _ د law. Similarly 不 one 能 be denied his/her personal liberty. That means 不 one 能 be arrested 跟 out being told  د  grounds 为 such an arrest. If arrested, د person has د right إلى defend himself 被 a lawyer 的 his choice. == 也 , 它 是 mandatory 为 د police إلى take 这 person to  د  nearest magistrate 跟 in 24 hours==. د magistrate, who 是 不 分 的 د police,  会  decide whe د r د arrest is justified 或 不 . This right 是 不 just confined إلى a guarantee 反 taking away 的 an individual’s life but has wider application. Various judgments 的 sc 有 expanded د scope 的 这 right. د sc

[[indian constitution#21]]
Article 21: Protection 的 life 和 personal liberty—No person shall be deprived 的 his life 或 personal liberty except according to procedure established 被 law.
 
 35
 
has ruled 这 这 right 也 includes right إلى live 跟 human dignity, free من exploitation. د 法院 has held 这 right إلى shelter 和 livelihood 是 也 included 里 د right إلى life because 不 person can live 跟 out د means 的 living, 这 is, د means 的 livelihood.

# Preventive detention
[[minority report- tom cruise]] [[cyber]]
Ordinarily, a person would be arrested _after_ 他 或 她 has reportedly committed some offence. However د re 是 exceptions إلى this. Sometimes a person 能  be arrested simply out 的 an apprehension that 他 或 她 是 likely إلى engage 里 unlawful activity 和 imprisoned for some time 跟 out following د above mentioned procedure. This is known as preventive detention. 它 means 这 if د 政府 feels 这 a person 能  be a threat إلى law 和 order 或 إلى د peace and security 的 د nation, 它 能  detain 或 arrest 这 person. ==This preventive detention 能  be extended 只 为 三 months.== 以后 three months such a case 是 brought before an advisory board 为 review.

On د face 的 it, preventive detention looks like an effective tool in د hands 的 د 政府 إلى deal 跟 anti-social elements 或 subversives. But 这 provision has often been misused 被 د 制度. Many 人 think 这 د re must be greater safeguards in 这 law so 这 它 may 不 be misused 反 人 为 reasons o د r than 这 / 是 really justified. ==里 fact, د re 是 a clear tension 中 right إلى life 和 personal liberty 和 د provision for preventive detention.==

 # 其他 自由
You 能  see 这 _ د right إلى 自由 د re 是 some 其他
rights as well. 这些 rights however 是 不 absolute. Each 的 这些
is subject إلى restrictions imposed 被 د 制度.
For example right إلى 自由 的 speech 和 expression 是 subject
to restrictions such as public order, peace 和 morality etc. 自由
to assemble 也 是 إلى be exercised peacefully 和 跟 out arms. د
government may impose restrictions 里 certain areas declaring د
assembly 的 five 或 更 persons as unlawful. Such 力s 能  be
easily misused 被 د administration. د genuine protest 反
an act 或 policy 的 政府 被 د 人 may be denied
 
 36
 
permission. However, if د 人 是 aware 和 vigilant 里 regard
to dr rights 和 choose إلى protest 反 such acts of
administration such misuse becomes rare. 里 د Constituent
Assembly itself, some members had expressed dr dissatisfaction
about restrictions 上 rights.

# Rights 的 accused
Our 宪法 ensures 这 persons accused 的 various offences would 也 get sufficient protection. We often tend إلى believe that anyone who 是 charged 跟 some offence 是 guilty. However, 不 one is guilty unless د 法院 has found 这 person guilty 的 an offence. 它 is  也  necessary 这 a person accused 的 any crime should get adequate opportunity إلى defend herself 或 himself. إلى ensure a fair trial 里 法院 s,
 د  宪法 has provided 三 rights:

± 不 person would be punished 为 د same offence 更 than
once,
± 不 law shall declare any action as illegal من a backdate, and
± 不 person shall be asked إلى 给 evidence 反 himself or herself.

==“I feel 这 many 的 这些 fundamental
rights 有 been framed من د point of
view 的 a police constable... 你  会  find that
very minimum rights 有 been conceded
and 是 almost invariably followed 被 a
[[proviso]]. Almost 每 article 是 followed by
a [[proviso]] / takes away د right almost
completely,...
...What should be our conception of
fr?...We want to
incorporate 每 one 的 those rights which
our 人 want إلى get.”

# RIGHT 反 EXPLOITATION

![[Pasted image 20210626115829.png]]

In our 国 د re 是 millions 的 people who 是 _ privileged 和 deprived. د y may be subjected إلى exploitation 被 dr fellow human beings. One such form 的 exploitation 里 our 国 has been _begar_ 或 forced labour 跟 out payment. Ano د r closely related form 的 exploitation 是 buying 和 selling 的 human beings 和 using د m as slaves. 兩 的 这些 是 prohibited _ د 宪法. Forced labour 过 imposed 被 landlords, 钱lenders 和 其他 wealthy persons 里 د past. Some form 的 bonded labour still continues 里 د country, specially in brick kiln work. 它 has now been declared a crime 和 它 是 punishable.

Check your progress
Do 你 think 这 د following situations demand restrictions 上 right إلى freedom? 给 reasons إلى support your answer.

a. 人 有 assembled 为 a peace march after communal riots 里 د 市. 
b. Dalits 是 denied entry 里 a temple. A march 是 being organised إلى forcibly 入 د temple.
c. Hundreds 的 Adivasis blocked د road demanding that د land taken away من د m 为 an industry be returned.
d. A caste panchayat 是 meeting إلى decide د  punishment إلى a young couple 为 marrying outside  د ir caste.
Name د fr whose violation 是 depicted 里 this photograph.
 
 38
 
 د  宪法 也 forbids employment 的 children below د 
age 的 14 年s 里 dangerous jobs like factories 和 mines. 跟 
child labour being made illegal 和 right إلى 教学  becoming a
fundamental right 为 children, 这 right 反 exploitation has
become 更 meaningful.

# RIGHT إلى 自由 的 RELIGION
According إلى our 宪法, everyone enjoys د right إلى follow
 د  religion 的 his 或 her choice. 这 自由 是 considered as a
hallmark 的  民主 . Historically, د re were rulers 和 emperors
in 不同 分s 的 د world who did 不 allow residents 的 د ir
countries إلى enjoy د right إلى 自由 的 religion. Persons following
a religion 不同 من 这 的 د ruler were ei د r persecuted or
forced إلى convert إلى د official religion 的 د rulers. د refore,
 民主  has always incorporated د 自由 إلى follow د religion
 的 one’s choice as one 的 its basic principles.
Freedom 的 faith 和 worship
In India, everyone 是 free إلى choose a religion 和 practice 这 religion.
Freedom 的 religion 也 includes د 自由 的 conscience. This
means 这 a person may choose any religion 或 may choose 不 to
follow any religion. 自由 的 religion includes د 自由 to
profess, follow 和 propagate any religion. 自由 的 religion is
subject إلى certain limitations. د 政府 能  impose restrictions
on د practice 的 自由 的 religion 里 order إلى protect public order,
morality 和 health. 这 means 这 د 自由 的 religion 是 不
an unlimited right. د 政府 能  interfere 里 religious matters
for rooting out certain social evils. 为 example 里 د past, د 
government has taken steps banning practices like sati, bigamy or
human sacrifice. Such restrictions cannot be opposed 里 د name
 的 interference 里 right إلى 自由 的 religion.
 د  limitations 上 د right إلى 自由 的 religion always produce
tensions 中 followers 的 various religions 和 د 制度.
When د 政府 seeks إلى restrict some activities 的 any religious
group, 人 的 这 religion feel 这 这 是 interference 里 د ir
religion.
Freedom 的 religion becomes a matter 的 政 controversy for
yet ano د r reason. د 宪法 has guaranteed د right
to propagate one’s religion. 这 includes persuading 人 to
 39
convert من one religion إلى ano د r. However, some 人 resent
conversions 上 د ground 这 这些 是 based 上 intimidation 或
inducement. د 宪法 does 不 allow forcible conversions. 它
only 给s us د right إلى spread information abt our religion 和
thus attract o د rs إلى it.
Equality 的 都 religions
Being a 国 / 是 home إلى several religions, 它 是 necessary
that د 政府 must extend equal treatment إلى 不同
religions. Negatively, 它 means 这 政府  会  不 favour any
particular religion. 印度 does 不 有 any official religion. We don’t
 有 إلى belong إلى any particular religion 里 order إلى be a prime
minister 或 president 或 judge 或 any 其他 public official. We 有
 也  seen 这 _ د right إلى equality, د re 是 a guarantee 这
government  会  不 discriminate 上 د basis 的 religion 里 giving
employment. د institutions run 被 د 国  会  不 preach any
religion 或 给 religious 教学  nor  会  د y favour persons 的
any religion. د objective 的 这些 provisions 是 إلى sustain 和
nurture د principle 的 secularism.
Activity
Make a list 的 public religious activities 这 take
place 里 your village 或 市 .
Which 的 这些 involve an exercise 的 right إلى religious
freedom?
Discuss what could 有 happened if 这 right was
not available إلى 人 里 your locality.
 # CULTURAL 和 教学 AL RIGHTS
When we talk 的 د 印度 society, د image 的 diversity comes before
our minds. 印度 是 不 made up 的 a monolithic society. We 是 a
society 这 has vast diversity. 里 such a society 这 是 full 的 diversity,
 د re would be social sections / 是 小 里 numbers compared
to some 其他 groups. If a group 是 里 minority,  会  它 有 إلى adopt
 د  culture 的 د majority?
Our 宪法 believes 这 diversity 是 our strength. د refore,
one 的 د fr 是 د right 的 د minorities إلى
maintain dr culture. 这 minority status 是 不 dependent only
 40
upon religion. Linguistic 和 cultural minorities 是 也 included
in 这 provision. Minorities 是 groups 这 有 common language
or religion 和 里 a particular 分 的 د 国 或 里 د country
as a whole, د y 是 outnumbered 被 some 其他 social section. Such
communities 有 a culture, language 和 a script 的 dr own, and
 有 د right إلى conserve 和 develop د se.
All minorities, religious 或 linguistic, 能  set up dr own
educational institutions. 被 doing so, د y 能  preserve 和 develop
 د ir own culture. د 政府  会  不 , while granting aid to
educational institutions, discriminate 反 any 教学 al
institution 上 د basis 这 它 是 _ د management 的 minority
community.
 RIGHT إلى 宪法AL REMEDIES
One would agree 这 our 宪法 contains a 很 impressive
list 的 fr. But merely writing down a list 的 rights
is 不 enough. د re has إلى be a way through / د y could be
realised 里 practice 和 defended 反 any attack 上 这些 rights.
“A heavy responsibility would be cast
on د majority إلى see 这 里 fact د 
minorities feel secure. ... د  只 safety
for د minorities lies 里 a secular State.
It pays د m إلى be nationalists ... د 
majority community should 不 boast
 的 dr national outlook. ... د y should
try إلى place د mselves 里 د position
 的 د minorities 和 try إلى appreciate
 د ir fears. 都 demands 为 safeguards
...are د products 的 those fears that
 د  minorities 有 里 dr minds, ...as
regards dr language, dr script and
 也  abt د services.”
Sardar Hukam Singh
CAD, VIII, p. 322, 26 May 1949
 41
Right إلى 宪法al remedies 是 د means through
which 这 是 إلى be achieved. Dr. Ambedkar considered
 د  right إلى 宪法al remedies as ‘heart 和 [[soul]] 的
 د  宪法’. 它 是 so because 这 right 给s a citizen
 د  right إلى approach a hc 或 د sc
to get any 的 د fr restored 里 case 的
 د ir violation. د sc 和 د High 法院 s
can issue orders 和 给 directives إلى د 政府 为
 د  enforcement 的 rights.
 د  法院 s 能  issue various special orders known as
writs.
±±±±± Habeas corpus: A writ 的 habeas corpus means
that د 法院 orders 这 د arrested person
should be presented before it. 它 能  也 order إلى
set free an arrested person if د manner 或
grounds 的 arrest 是 不 lawful 或 satisfactory.
±±±±± Mandamus: 这 writ 是 issued when د 法院
finds 这 a particular office holder 是 不 doing
legal duty 和 د reby 是 infringing 上 د right 的
an individual.
±±±±± Prohibition: 这 writ 是 issued 被 a higher 法院
( hc 或 sc ) when a lower 法院
has considered a case going beyond its jurisdiction.
±±±±± Quo Warranto: If د ^ 法院 finds 这 a person 是
holding office but 是 不 entitled إلى hold 这 office,
it issues د writ 的 quo warranto 和 restricts 这
person من acting as an office holder.
±±±±± Certiorari: _ 这 writ, د 法院 orders a
lower 法院 或 ano د r authority إلى transfer a
matter pending before 它 إلى د higher authority 或
 法院 .
Apart من د judiciary, many 其他 mechanisms
 有 been created 里 later 年s 为 د protection 的
rights. 你 may 有 heard abt د National
Commission 上 Minorities, د National Commission 上
Women, د National Commission 上 Scheduled Castes,
I am 里 minority 里 my locality
but majority 里 د town,
minority if 你 look at my
language but majority if 你 go
by my religion... Aren’t we all
minorities?
 42
etc. 这些 institutions protect د rights 的 women, minorities or
Dalits. Besides, د National Human Rights Commission has  也 
been established 被 law إلى protect د fundamental 和 其他 kinds
 的 rights.
National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
 د  real test 的 د rights 给n 被 any 宪法 是 in
 د ir actual implementation. د poor, illiterate 和 د 
deprived sections 的 د society must be able إلى exercise
 د ir rights. Independent organisations like د 人 ’s
Union 为 Civil Liberties (PUCL) 或 人 ’s Union for
民主ic Rights (PUDR) 有 been working as
watchdogs 反 د violations 的 rights. 里 this
background, د 政府 has established 里 1993 an
institution, د National Human Rights Commission.
 د  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is
composed 的 a former chief justice 的 د sc
 的 India, a former judge 的 د sc , a former
chief justice 的 a hc 和 二 其他 members who
 有 knowledge 和 practical experience 里 matters
relating إلى human rights.
 د  Commission’s functions include inquiry at its own
initiative 或 上 a petition presented إلى 它 被 a victim into
complaint 的 violation 的 human rights; visit إلى jails to
study د condition 的 د inmates; _ taking and
promoting research 里 د field 的 human rights, etc.
 د  Commission receives complaints 里 千s
every 年. 这些 relate إلى custodial death, custodial rape,
disappearances, police excesses, failure 里 taking action,
indignity إلى women, etc. Its most significant intervention
has been 上 disappeared youth 里 Punjab and
investigation 和 trial 的 Gujarat riot cases where its
intervention proved effective.
 د  Commission does 不 有 د power of
prosecution. 它 能  merely make recommendations إلى د 
government 或 recommend إلى د 法院 s إلى initiate
proceedings based 上 د inquiry 这 它 conducts.

 DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES 的 国 POLICY
 د  makers 的 our 宪法 knew 这 independent 印度 过
going إلى face many challenges. Foremost 中 这些 过 د
challenge إلى bring abt equality 和 well-being 的 都 citizens. د y
 也  thought 这 certain policy direction 过 required 为 handling
 د se problems. At د same time, د 宪法 did 不 want
[[future]] governments إلى be bound 被 certain policy decisions.
 د refore, some guidelines were incorporated 里 د 宪法
but د y were 不 made legally enforceable: 这 means 这 if a
government did 不 implement a particular guideline, we cannot go
to د 法院 asking د 法院 إلى instruct د 政府 إلى implement
that policy. Thus, 这些 guidelines 是 ‘non-justiciable’ i.e., 分s 的
 د  宪法 这 cannot be enforced 被 د judiciary. Those who
framed our 宪法 thought 这 د moral force behind 这些
guidelines would ensure 这 د 政府 would take د m
seriously. Besides, د y expected 这 د 人 would 也 hold
 د  governments responsible 为 implementing 这些 directives. So,
a separate list 的 policy guidelines 是 included 里 د 宪法.
 د  list 的 这些 guidelines 是 called د Directive Principles 的 国
Policy.
What do د Directive Principles contain?
 د  chapter 上 Directive Principles lists mainly 三 things:
± د goals 和 objectives 这 we as a society should adopt;
± certain rights 这 individuals should enjoy apart من د
fr; 和
± certain policies 这 د 政府 should adopt.
You may get some idea 的 د vision 的 makers 的 our 宪法
by looking at some 的 د Directive Principles shown below.
 د  governments من time إلى time tried إلى 给 effect إلى some
[[Directive Principles 的 国 Policy.]] د y passed several zamindari
abolition bills, nationalised banks, enacted numerous factory laws,
fixed minimum wages, cottage 和 小 industries were promoted
and provisions 为 reservation 为 د uplift 的 د scheduled castes
and scheduled tribes were made. Such efforts إلى 给 effect إلى د 
 44
Directive Principles include د right إلى 教学 , formation of
panchayati raj institutions 都 over د country, partial right إلى work
_ employment guarantee programme 和 د mid-day meal
scheme etc.

It 是 estimated 这 د re 是 abt 三 million urban homeless
in India. Night shelters 是 不 available 为 更 than five per
cent 的 这 population. Hundreds 的 这些 old, sick homeless
people 是 killed 被 cold wave during winter. د y cannot 有
ration 和 voting cards 里 د absence 的 any ‘pro 的 的 residence’.
跟 out 这些 documents د y 也 cannot avail government
help as needy patients. A 大 number 的 这些 homeless 人
are casual workers, who earn 很 low wages. د y travel to
 د  市 里 search 的 work من 不同 分s 的 د country.
Use 这些 facts إلى write a petition إلى د sc of
India _ د Right إلى 宪法al Remedies. Your petition
should mention:
a. What fr 是 being denied إلى د homeless
in dr everyday life?
b. What kind 的 order would 你 request د sc
to issue?
Fundamental Duties 的 citizens
± 里 1976, د 42nd amendment إلى د 宪法 was
passed. 中 其他 things, 这 amendment inserted
a list 的 Fundamental Duties 的 Citizens. 里 all, ten duties
were enumerated. However, د 宪法 does 不
say anything abt enforcing 这些 duties.
± As citizens, we must abide 被 د 宪法, defend
our country, promote harmony 中 都 citizens, protect
 د  environment.
± However, 它 must be 不 ed 这 our 宪法 does
not make د enjoyment 的 rights dependent or
conditional upon fulfilment 的 duties. 里 这 sense, د 
inclusion 的 fundamental duties has 不 changed د 
status 的 our fr.

## DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
Tell me what 是 د point of
saying nice things 里 د 
宪法 if 这些 cannot be
implemented 被 any 法院 ?
 46
Principles exhort د 政府 إلى do certain things. Fundamental
Rights mainly protect د rights 的 individuals while directive
principles ensure د well-being 的 د entire society.
However, at times, when 政府 intends إلى implement
Directive Principles 的 国 Policy, 它 能  come 里 conflict 跟 د 
fr 的 د citizen.
This problem arose when د 政府 sought إلى pass laws to
abolish zamindari system. 这些 measures were opposed 上 د 
ground 这 د y violated right إلى property. However, keeping 里 mind
 د  societal needs 这 是 greater than د individual interests, د 
government amended د 宪法 إلى 给 effect إلى د Directive
Principles 的 国 Policy. 这 led إلى a long legal battle. د executive
and د judiciary took 不同 positions. د 政府 claimed
that rights 能  be abridged 为 giving effect إلى Directive Principles.
This argument assumed 这 rights were a hindrance إلى welfare of
 د  人 . 上 د 其他 hand, د 法院 held د view that
fr were so 重要 和 sacred 这 د y cannot
be limited even 为 purposes 的 implementing Directive Principles.
Right إلى Property
Behind د controversy abt د relationship 中 rights
and directive principles, د re 过 one 重要 reason: in
 د  宪法, originally, د re 过 a fundamental right to
‘acquire, possess 和 maintain’ property. But د 宪法
made 它 clear 这 property could be taken away 被 د 
government 为 public welfare. Since 1950, 政府 made
many laws 这 limited 这 right إلى property. 这 right 过 at
 د  centre 的 د long debate over د relationship 中 rights
and directive principles. Finally, 里 1973, د sc
gave a decision 这 د right إلى property 过 不 分 的 د 
basic structure 的 د 宪法 和 د refore, parliament
had power إلى abridge 这 right 被 an amendment. 里 1978, د 
44 th amendment إلى د 宪法 removed د right إلى property
from د list 的 fr 和 converted 它 into a simple
legal right _ article 300 A.
What difference, do 你 think, 这 变 的 status makes
to د right إلى property?
 47
This generated ano د r complicated debate. 这 related إلى د
amendment 的 د 宪法. د 政府 过 saying 这
Parliament 能  amend any 分 的 د 宪法. د 法院 过
saying 这 Parliament cannot make an amendment 这 violated
fr. 这 controversy 过 settled 被 an 重要
decision 的 د sc 里 Kesavananda Bharati case. 里 this
case, د 法院 said 这 د re 是 certain basic features 的 د
宪法 和 这些 cannot be changed 被 Parliament. We shall
discuss 这 里 greater detail 里 Chapter 9 上 ‘宪法 as a Living
Document’.

Conclusion
In د writings 的 Jotirao Phuley (1827-1890), a radical social
reformer من Maharashtra, we find one 的 د earliest
expressions 的 د view 这 rights include 兩 自由 and
equality. During د national movement, 这 idea 的 rights was
fur د r sharpened 和 expanded إلى 宪法al rights. Our
宪法 reflected 这 long tradition 和 listed د 
fr. Since 1950, د judiciary has functioned
as an 重要 protector 的 rights.
Judicial interpretations 有 expanded د scope 的 rights
in many respects. د 政府 和 administration 的 our
country function 跟 in 这 overall framework. Rights enforce
limitations 上 د functioning 的 د 政府 和 ensure
民主ic governance 的 د country.
