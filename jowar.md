Jowar, also known as Sorghum, is the most important food and fodder crop of dryland agriculture.
The coarse cereals together occupy about 16.50 per cent of the total cropped area in the country.
Among these, jowar or sorghum alone accounts for about 5.3 per cent of the total cropped area.
It is the main food crop in semi-arid areas of central and southern India.
Maharashtra alone produces more than 1/2 of the total jowar production of the country.
Other leading producer states of jowar are Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
It is sown in both Kharif and rabi seasons in southern states.
But it is a Kharif crop in northern India where it is mostly grown as a fodder crop.
South of Vindhyachal, it is a rainfed crop and its yield level is very low in this region.
