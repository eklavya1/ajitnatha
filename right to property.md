Originally, the right to property was one of the seven fundamental rights under Part Ill of the Constitution.
It was dealt with by [[protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech etc]](1)(f) and [[a31 compulsory acquisition of property]]
Article 19(1)(f) guaranteed to every citizen the right to acquire, hold and dispose of the property.
[[a31 compulsory acquisition of property]], on the other hand, guaranteed to every person, whether citizen or non-citizen, the right against deprivation of his property.
It provided that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law.
**It empowered the State to acquire or requisition the property of a person on two conditions -**
(a) it should be for a public purpose, and
(b) it should provide for payment of compensation (amount) to the owner.
Therefore, the 44th Amendment Act of [[1978]] abolished the right to property as a Fundamental Right by repealing Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31 from Part Instead, the Act inserted a new Article 300A in Part XII under the heading 'Right to Property.
**It provides that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law. Thus, the right to property still remains a legal right or a constitutional right, though no longer a fundamental right.**
It is not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
