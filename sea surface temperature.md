Sea surface temperature (SST), or ocean surface [[temperature]], is water temperature close to ocean's surface. exact meaning of surface varies according to measurement method used, but it is between 1 millimetre (0.04 in) & 20 metres (70 ft) below sea surface. Air masses in Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of shore. Localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass. Warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of tropical cyclogenesis over Earth's oceans. Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of upper 30 metres (100 ft) of ocean. SST changes diurnally, like air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy days than on calm days. In addition, ocean currents such as Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales, a major impact results from global thermohaline circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of world's oceans.

Ocean temperature is related to ocean heat content. increase of ocean temperature is an important effect of climate change on oceans.

Coastal SSTs can cause offshore winds to generate upwelling, which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses, but shallower waters over a continental shelf are often warmer. Onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant, such as northwest coast of South America. Its values are important within numerical weather prediction as SST influences atmosphere above, such as in formation of sea breezes & sea fog. It is also used to calibrate measurements from weather satellites.
