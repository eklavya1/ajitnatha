Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow, meandering air currents in atmospheres of some planets, including [[Earth]]. On Earth, main jet streams are located near altitude of [[tropopause]] and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to direction of remainder of jet.
