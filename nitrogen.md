Buming fossil fuels, application of nitrogen-based fertilizers, and other activities can dramatically increase the amount of biologically available nitrogen in an ecosystem.
The main sources of nitrogen in the atmosphere therefore include -
	Atmospheric precipitation,
	Geological sources,
	Agricultural land,
	Livestock (ruminants like cows, sheep, goats etc) and poultry operations and
	Urban waste,
	Fossil fuels
