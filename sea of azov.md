- The **sea of azov** (Russian: Азовское море, romanized: Azovskoye more; Ukrainian: Азовське море, romanized: Azovs’ke more) is a sea in Eastern Europe connected to the [[Black Sea]] by the narrow (about 4 km or 2.5 mi) [[Strait of Kerch]], and is sometimes regarded as a northern extension of the Black Sea. The sea is bounded by [[Russia]] on the southeast and by [[Ukraine]] on the northwest.
- The sea is largely affected by the inflow of the Don, Kuban, and other rivers, which bring sand, silt, and shells, which in turn form numerous bays, limans, and narrow spits. Because of these deposits, the sea bottom is relatively smooth and flat with the depth gradually increasing toward the middle. Also, due to the river inflow, water in the sea has low salinity and a high amount of biomass (such as green algae) that affects the water colour.
- **Abundant plankton result in unusually high fish [[productivity]]**. The sea shores and spits are low; they are rich in [[vegetation]] and bird colonies.
- *Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world*, with the depth varying between 0.9 and 14 metres (3 and 46 ft). There is a constant outflow of water from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.
