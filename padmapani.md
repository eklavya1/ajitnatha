In Buddhism, Avalokiteśvara ( Sanskrit: अवलोकितेश्वर )  is a bodhisattva who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas. He has 108 avatars; one notable avatar being Padmapāṇi, the one who holds the lotus (padma). This bodhisattva is variably depicted, described and portrayed in different cultures as either male or female. In Tibet, he is known as Chenrezig. In China, Taiwan and other Chinese communities, Avalokiteśvara has evolved into the somewhat different female figure Guanyin or Guanshiyin, also known as Kannon or Kanzeon in Japan, Gwanseum in Korea and Quán Thế Âm in Vietnamese. In the Kathmandu valley, this figure is known as Jana Baha Dyah, Karunamaya or Seto Machindranath. He is known as Natha Deviyo in Sri Lanka and Lokanatha In Myanmar(Burma). In Thailand and Cambodia, he is called as Lokesvara.
