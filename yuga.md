krita treta dvapara kali

A yuga, in Hinduism, is generally used to indicate an age of time.In the [[Rigveda]], a yuga refers to generations, a long period, a very brief period, or a yoke (joining of two things). In the Mahabharata, the words yuga and kalpa (a day of Brahma) are used interchangeably to describe the cycle of creation and destruction.The names  "Yuga" and "Age" commonly denote a catur-yuga (pronounced Chatur Yuga), a cycle of four world ages, for example, in the Surya Siddhanta and Bhagavad Gita (part of the Mahabharata), unless expressly limited by the name of one of its minor ages: Krita (Satya) Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, or Kali Yuga.
