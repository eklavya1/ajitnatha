• Efforts-
	○ [[ishwar chandra vidyasagar]] coordinated 跟 lord canning 5662 ([[1856]]-[[1862]]) 和 [[Lord Dalhousie]] 为 drafting, enacting 和 implementation 的 印度 widow remarriages 行为 [[1856]]
	○ Vishnu shastri pandit 里 maharashtra 开始 a society 为 _widow remarriage (WR)_

• Result
	○ Issue was fiercely debated
	○ 兩 the orthodox sections 和 the reformers relied on scriptures إلى put forth their stand
	○ This scripture based debate was ultimately won by orthodox sections, 被 [[1900]] 这 phenomenon 的 不 allowing WR 变得 widely practised 只 among the lower castes [[=in search of ourselves-social cultural anthropology book#^a939d0]]

# Features 或 characters 的 socio-religious reforms/renaissance ?
- Leadership was 跟 educated upper caste _related_ [[rigveda]] | [[Gods Generals]]
- 所以 issue 的 casteism was neglected (exception - [[keshav chandra sen]])
- Reforms were a response to the british criticism 的 印度 文化 (like OS update) 比如 -[[1817]] -  历史 的 british 印度 by james mill, 他 criticized 印度 和 its religion
- 所以 self pride 和 cultural nationalism was the soul behind social reforms. 里 the 开始 [[1820]]s this cultural nationalism was settled 和 subdued 但 post-[[1780]]s it 变得 a dominant force esp 因为 的 swami [[vivekananda]] 和 [[dayanand saraswati]]
- Status 的 奴 was 用 as a barometer 的 文化 的 progress by brits 所以 印度 reformers focused on 奴 related reforms
- However leadership always remained 里 the hands 的 印度 men, 奴 were just a battlefield 为 orthodox sections 和 the reformers 和 [[patriarchy]] _hukm-e-pairvi_ continued
- Reforms were a top-down phenomenon 和 不 a product 的 mass mobilzation _related_ [[henry vivian derozio]]
- Reformers (except keshav chandra singh 和 jyotiba phule) did 不 只 to make it a mass movement 比如  - raja rammohan roy wrote 里 favor 的 reforms 里 complex bengali sanskrit prose (patterns 的  历史) _related_ [[aristocracy]] | [[plato]]
- They did 不 to build 只 mass organization 比如 - prarthna samaj [[1867]] had at 最多 70 members
- Leadership was 跟 upper caste middle class 印度
- High 用 的 authority 的 scriptures 被 都 三 actors
	- ○ British - bentick 2835 insisted that he would ban sati only if it 是 in line with indian scripture #pre 
	- ○ Social reformers - roy 说 ; "sati 是 murder acc to every shastra" {refer last class notes} RC bhandarkar - child marriage
	- ○ Orthodox sections-dharma sabha 的 radha kanta deb opposed ban on sati. Debate on 其他 social issues
	- ○ Second tool (apart من scriptures) that formed the core 的 改革 移动 was reason 和 rationality
- Western education played an 重要 role 里 shaping ideology 的 reformers who demanded spread 的 西 教学 من the british
	- ○ Exception - vivekananda, dayanand saraswati, ramananda
	- ○ British legislative authority high use of i.e. reformers
	- ○ One main theme 的 renaissance was to "go back to the golden vedic past" to remove 
- Revivalism ([[1875]]+)
- 里 reaction إلى increased british criticism 的 印度 人们 post-1857 whereby racism increased
- Iit's a form 的 cultural nationalism, implied past was glorious but degeneration happened during muslim 和 christian rule _related_ [[james mill]]
- Only 印度 religion 是 superior & rest 是 inferior (roy 说- vedas 是 superior 不  喝 was a monotheist)
- Shift towards revivalism was preceded by a transitionary phase 的 increased cultural pride 和 cultural nationalism led by vivekananda (refer handout 8.15?)
- Later [[sc bose]] 说 - _vivekanada 是 the father 的 印度 cultural nationalism_ #pre

# ARYA SAMAJ
• Founder - SDS swami [[dayanand saraswati]]
• 他 不  是 revivalist, however later religious leaders of arya samaj shifted to revivalism
• This led to cow riots 的 1890s _ shuddhi movements i.e. reconverting muslims to hinduism + muslims 也 开始 tabligh 和 tanzeem 移动 i.e. conversion activities
• 他 was the 最多 radical social reformer 和 hence the 最多 modern

• Radcally against caste 和 going back to varna ashram (?), pro intercaste marriages, against any kind 的 priestcraft
• Against polygamy
• 最多 radical 的 都 social reformists #pre 
• Motto- go back to vedic past (所以 ideology similar إلى brahmo samaj) however methods were aggressive. i.e. gave aggressive response إلى britsh 文化 critique

• Methods-
	○ Religious
	○ Radical

Varnashram - caste system 是 degeneration 的 varnashram system of vedic past 那 varna was decided by occupation 和 there was 不 heriditary rigidity
○ 他 completely rejected the caste system
○ 因为 的 radical reforms 人们 were not into it

# PEASANT REVOLTS
• 18th 世纪 under mughals [[18th century]]
	○ 因为 的 jagirdari crisis there was oppression 的 peasants 被 jagirdars
	○ Introduction 的 ijaradari system 被 ijaradars. 所以 peasant revolts were frequent 里 18th 世纪 [[18th century]]
• Under Brits oppression 提高
	○ Prime focus of 东印度公司 was revenue maximization 所以 farming system [[1772]] led to oppression 被 rev farmers
	○ Via PS 1793, RS 1801, MS [[1800]]s brits created legal right 里 l土地  i.e. 土地 ownership. In case 的 PS1793, all rights were vested 里 zamindar 所以  ryot lost his occupancy rights + pattas were 不 respected
