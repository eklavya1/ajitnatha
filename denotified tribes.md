term 'de-notified tibesâ€¢ stands for all those communities which were once notified under criminal tribes acts, enforced by british raj b/w 1871 & 1947.
a few of these communities which were listed as de-notified were also nomadic.
dnts are a heterogenous group engaged in various occupations such as transport, key-making, salt trading, entertaining acrobats, dancers, snake charmers, jugglers & pastoralists.
these communities were branded 'bom criminals' under colonial-era criminal tribes act, 1871. 
they were 'denotified' in 1952 when independent india repealed this act.
but habitual offenders act, 1952, kicked in soon after.
there are nearly 1 ,500 nomadic & semi-nomadic tribes & 198 denotified tribes, comprising 15 crore indians, acc to renke commission, 2008.
o renke commission (2008) was commissioned by govt of india, to identify & list dnt communities.
o govt in july 2014 had constituted national commission for denotified, nomadic & semi-nomadic tribes (ncdnt) for a period of 3 years to prepare a state-wise list of castes
belonging to denotified & nomadic tribes & to suggest appropriate measures
these tribes remain socially & economically marginalised even now, depriving many of them of basic human rights.
de-notified & nomadic communities have diverse ideological patterns, culture, political & social lifestyle, customs & traditions.
customs of nomadic communities have a long tradition of continuity & many of their practices claim on ancient heritage.
they have their own gods & goddesses. moreover, their own festivals & celebrations are diversified.
social & cultural characteristics of nomadic communities are closely related with their economic activities.
most of communities follow a traditional system of moving in groups of five to twenty with a senior member who is responsible for settling disputes, leading each group ministry of social justice & empowerment acts as nodal agency for implementing development & welfare programmes for dnt.
