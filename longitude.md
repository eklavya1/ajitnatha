- Longitudes is an angular distance, measured in degrees along the equator east or west of the Prime Meridian. This means one half of the world is measured in degrees of east longitude up to 180°, and the other half in degrees of west longitude up to 180°. Each line of longitude equals half of the circumference of the Earth because each extends from the North Pole to the South Pole and passes through the equator. Hence, all longitudes are of equal length irrespective of the location of the observer, whether one is at pole or equator.
- As the longitudes converge towards the poles, the distance between two corresponding longitudes decreases poleward. It is highest at the equator.
