the cryosphere (from the greek κρύος kryos, "cold", "frost" or "ice" and σφαῖρα sphaira, "globe, ball") is an all-encompassing term for those portions of earth's surface where water is in solid form, including sea [[ice]], lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost). thus, there is a wide overlap with the hydrosphere. the cryosphere is an integral part of the global climate system with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, precipitation, hydrology, atmospheric and oceanic circulation. through these feedback processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in the global climate and in climate model response to global changes. approximately 10% of the earth's surface is covered by ice, but this is rapidly decreasing. the term deglaciation describes the retreat of cryospheric features. cryology is the study of cryospheres.
