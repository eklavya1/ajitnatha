## foreign policy of india & its determinants
foreign policy of india & its determinants (2:10 pm)

foreign policy: it's planned course of action or strategy of a govt aimed at achieving identified national interest of country.
foreign policy of a country is determined by a number of factors which are referred to as determinants of foreign policy.
so factors shaping foreign policy of a country are c/a determinants of foreign policy.
some determinants of foreign policy
geography
history
culture
economic
military strength
domestic institutions (political parties, nature of govt, etc)
world order
geography- as determinant of india’s foreign policy
india’s strategic location at center of asian arc extending from aden (yemen) to tokyo, makes it a gateway to southeast asia, west asia, & south asia.
it's  b/c of this usa & ussr initially competed to bring india within their sphere of influence, during cold war.
india’s location at head of indian ocean, along with other determinants of power makes india a net security provider.
india’s vast coastline necessitates strong diplomacy with pacific rim countries.
india shares manmade frontiers with pakistan, bangladesh, myanmar, china, etc, which requires a strategic approach towards security of its borders.
unlike usa & uk, india has to focus on continent as well as coasts in its foreign policy formulation.
india’s look east & look west policies are determined by geography & are also expressed in geographical terms.
india’s geographical & population size makes it a contender for unsc membership.
distance has been officially identified as prime inhibiting factor in development of close relations b/w india & latin america.
culture as a determinant of india's foreign policy (2:40 pm)
there are very few civilizational states in world & india is 1 of them.
therefore india's worldview can not be separated from its culture & tradition.
in fact, while preparing india's foreign policy, jawaharlal nehru had commented that he is merely rediscovering india's foreign policy from past.
indian civilizational values such as tolerance, non-violence, vasudhaiva kutumbakam, & sarve bhavantu sukhinah strengthen india's commitment to international peace.
india is 1 of few countries which constitutionally commits its citizens to abide by international laws.
while other countries use military coercion or economic incentives (hard power) to gain influence in international sphere.
india has sought to leverage its cultural relations be it with south-east asian countries, west asian countries, or afghanistan to develop mutually beneficial partnerships.
india's culture forms basis of its soft power.
yoga, ayurveda, indian philosophy, & mythology have augmented india's soft power.
though indian culture has had a dominant passive tradition, it does have a strong realist tradition represented in kautilyas' arthashashtra & his mandal siddhant.
mandal siddhant is indian theory of geopolitics.
mandal siddhant states that 'your neighbor is your enemy while your neighbor's neighbor is your friend'.
in fact, we see a greater influence of realist tradition on foreign policies of bjp while congress party is reflective of more mute or passive tradition of india culture.
civilizational states like india do not merely use foreign policy to serve their national interests.
instead, they try to shape world order acc to their civilization values.
for instance, during cold war, india suggested non-violent option of 3rd pole in a world order bifurcated by 2 poles.
historical factors as a determinant of india's foreign policy:
past experiences shape attitudes of foreign policymakers.
india being a colony for more than 200 years made it ardent supporter of anti-colonial movements in asia & africa.
india supported anti-apartheid movement in south africa.
india's history of bitter partition continues to sour india-pakistan relations.
military factors as a determinant of india's foreign policy:
present world order is unipolar when it comes to military supremacy.
it's multipolar otherwise.
india could secure its national interest & emerge as a major power in world only after it became a de facto nuclear weapon state in 1998.
it forced single superpower usa to come to negotiating table with india.
economic factors as a determinant of india's foreign policy:
it was only after lpg reforms of 1991 & india's adoption of new economic policy that india could acquire major power status in world. 
in present times, due importance of economic strengths in securing a country's national interest is evident from fact that today foreign policy seeks to achieve a country's economic objectives.
world order as a determinant of india's foreign policy:
when world was bipolar india co-founded nam as alternative to then 2 poles & associated defense pacts.
during unipolar world, india chose to befriend & bandwagon superpower.
today when world is multi-polar, india is engaging with a number of countries.
eg. india engages with usa & indo-pacific to balance aggressive china.
india now favors issue-based politics.
india has strategic partnerships with more than 30 countries.
india is a part of a trilateral with russia & china while simultaneously engaging with usa & other usa allies on platforms such as jai & quad.

## evolution of india's foreign policy
evolution of india's foreign policy (3:48 pm)

phases of evolution:
phase 1 (1947 to 1962): phase of high idealism
phase 2 (1962 to 1971): phase of realism & recovery
phase 3 (1971 to 1991): phase of great regional assertion
phase 4 (1991 to 2001): phase in context of usa's unipolarity
phase 5 (2001 to 2014): phase in context of increase in competitive environment internationally
phase 6 (from 2014): phase in context of decline in usa's hegemony & west became increasingly reluctant to share global responsibilities & china offering progressively hardened terms of engagement to world
phase 1: phase of optimistic non-alignment
characteristic feature of this phase is india's policy of non-alignment
purpose of this policy was:
to escape entrapment of cold war politics,
to maintain greatest possible independence in conduct of india's foreign affairs, and
to be able to judge issues based on their own merits & not to be forced to any particular stand.
india distinguished policy of non-alignment with neutrality.
under this policy, india was not war averse. if need arose inia would participate in war.
india would analyze issues on their merit & accly take a stand.
however, india's policy of non-alignment was criticized by usa as india's opportunism.
while stalin commented those not with ussr are against it.
was india's policy of non-alignment its idealism alone?
it was not idealism alone.
it had practical aspects. (further details will be discussed in next class)
