## Opportunity cost
[[opportunity cost]]
refers to the benefit forgone in choosing while making a choice between a given set of options.
For an economist, a decision is acceptable **as long as** the utilization of resources is optimal.
Once presented with different options, regarding the utilization of resources a decision can be made based on the personal preferences of the decision-makers.
Such a decision leads to loss of benefits associated with the choice that was not exercised.
The loss of these benefits is the opportunity cost.
No actual loss takes place rather it is a comparative loss with respect to the choice made.
Opportunity cost is denoted in terms of the alternate use of the resource, rather than in terms of the resource itself.
Refer to PPT
Eg- in the above scenario choosing b over d entails a loss of 330 berries. In order to gain 4 extra deer, 330 berries are the opportunity cost.
## Marginal cost (MC)
[[marginal cost]]
- is the cost of production of the Nth unit given (N-1) has already been produced.
- Eg- hunting first deer may take only 30 minutes; therefore, the marginal cost of 1st deer is 30 minutes.
- Hunting the second deer may take 1 hour; therefore, the marginal cost of 2nd deer is 1 hour.
- The total cost of 2 deer is one hour 30 minutes, or an average cost of 1 deer, given only 2 have been hunted is 45 minutes.

## Utility of PPF
(1.42 PM)
[[production possibility frontier]]
- Plotting the PPF of different countries helps us to understand how far one country is from its PPF.
- In a low-income, developing country we expect that the factors of production would not be fully utilized.
- Also, even those factors of production which are being utilized have a lot of scope of increasing their productivity.
- As such for developing countries, their actual level of output would be far away from their potential output especially when comparing the distance to PPF with a developed country.
- It also reflects that the scope of growth for such a country is vast in comparison to a developed country.
- The government is now democratically elected.

## How economic decisions are taken
(2.00 PM)
Taken with the advice of economists.
The advice of economists has evolved over a period of time:
1. Till the 1700s- the decisions were taken by the king himself. It was mostly based on the expansion of territories to collect tax It was called a fiscal-military state. [[military fiscalism]] [[tipu sultan]] [[hyder ali]] [[mughal]] [[mughal administration]]
2. The mid-1700s onwards- Classical economics
Adam Smith proposed that the manner of making decisions should be based on individual- Laissez-Faire state.
“Invisible hand of God”
3. The Great Depression 1930s- Keynesian Economics- interventionist state
The government should intervene and form the policies accordingly.
4. 1960s- Monetarism- Minimalist state
Because there is no limit to government intervention. It causes an excess expenditure and more inflation in the economy.
5. The 1970s and 1980s- Maximum state
The government is taking all the decisions.
6. The 90s and beyond- behavioral economics and internationalism
When the behavior of the person in decision-making is incorporated, it increases acceptability. 
Eg- Jan Dhan Yojana
7. Internationalism is accounting for international standards. Eg- the Indian government is considering WTO norms in producing solar panels.

## A brief history of economic decisions
Fiscal military state till the 1700s- economic decisions were taken with the objective of expanding the territory with the help of a bigger military so that more taxes could be collected.
Spending of those taxes was the discretion of the king and welfare activities were usually taken up as hobbies.

Classical economics
laissez faire
Economic thought became organized.
It was proposed that an individual working in their selfish interest would maximize the efficiency of utilization of resources.
An individual works for benefit, it automatically results in maximization of social benefits.

Keynesian economics
interventionist state
Keynes argued that certain situations require the government to interfere because of the market by itself for maximizing social welfare.

Monetarist school
Pointed out that Keynesian intervention in the economy causes the problem of increasing debts and inflation which cause inter-generational inequity.
As the repayment of the debt would be done by future generations.
Also, excessive spending causes inflation which hurts the economy.

Welfarism
welfare state is a state in which the government assumes the responsibility for the welfare of its population.
Welfarism slowly becomes a slippery slope. When the idea of welfare starts encompassing those responsibilities which are now expected to be performed by the government which otherwise, it would not have been responsible for.
Welfarism is often associated with the idea of inclusive growth, transforming into a maximal state.

Behaviouralism
manner of decision making in which the decisions incorporate the behavior of those who are affected by those decisions.
It is a method to improve the effectiveness of decisions.

Internationalism
is the incorporation in domestic decision-making.
## Law of demand
(2.58 PM)
demand for goods is inversely related to price keeping all other things constant.
If any other variable changes, eg- income, then we need to make a new demand curve.
The Law of supply depends on the multiple factors which we keep constant.
The price which the supplier demands from the [[market]].
If the price is less than the equilibrium price, then supply is less and demand is more.
Some people’s demands are not met so they are ready to pay more price.

Law of demand: the demand of a good depends upon multiple factors such as its price, incomes of people, taste, and preferences, size of the population, etc.
The law of demand states that keeping all other factors that determine demand as constant, the quantity demanded varies inversely with price.
## law of supply
supply of a good that is the total production of the good depends upon multiple factors such as the price of the good in the market, availability, and price of raw materials and intermediate goods, technology for utilizing factors of production, government policies such as taxes and subsidies, etc.
The law of supply states that given all other factors as constant the supply of a good varies positively with the price.

## Market clearance and equilibrium price
(3.31 PM)

The demand of a good and its supply together determine the price at which the good would be solved in the market.
The price is a market-clearing price because at this price the quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal to each other.
And therefore, there is no buyer whose demand has not been met or no supplier who has not been able to sell his goods, clearing the market.
This is the equilibrium price as there is no upward or downward pressure on the price.

## Types of goods
(3.34 PM)
Dictation- 3.54 PM
Goods based on the slope of demand curve:
### Necessary goods
those goods that have a near-vertical demand curve.
For such goods, the change in quantity demanded is very less even when there is a big change in price.
Eg- life-saving drugs, water, etc. 

### Luxury goods
those goods that have a near-horizontal demand. For such goods, there is a big change in quantity demanded, even when there is a small movement in price. Eg- Luxury cars are priced in such a manner that they are just unaffordable for the masses.
A small decrease in their price will make their demand increase manifold

## Type of goods based on incomes and demand
### Normal good
when incomes increase, normally we expect, increase in demand for goods at all prices. For such goods, the demand curve shifts outwards. Such goods are called normal goods whose demand increases increase in income.
### Inferior good
They are those goods whose demand decreases with an increase in incomes, thereby, shifting their demand curve inwards.
### Exceptional goods
Goods that do not seem to follow the law of demand. Certain goods in some very specific circumstances may behave in a manner that it seems that they are violating the law of demand.
In other circumstances, their behavior may be on the expected lines but in some specific circumstances mostly theoretical, they may seem to show a behavior where their quantity demanded increases with their price.
There are 2 types of such goods:
#### Giffen and Veblen
##### Veblen goods
ultra-luxury goods that are usually associated with status symbols.
When the price decreases, then, the people who could afford them, may stop associating them with the status, decreasing their price and demand.
On the other hand, when their prices rise, more people who could afford them earlier purchase these goods as now a greater status symbol may be acquired through their possession- thereby, increasing the demand with an increase in price. Eg- luxury sports cars or expensive jewelry.

##### Giffen goods
[[giffen goods]]
inferior goods that show an increase in demand with an increase in their price.
There are no specific examples of Giffen goods or Veblen goods rather there are circumstances in which good behaves like a Giffen or Veblen goods.
An inferior good may be substituted with a normal good when a household’s income increases.

The topic for the next class: classification of goods (to be continued); National Income Accounting.
