- The expenditure approach is an alternate way to measure national income.
- Under this approach, we directly measure the AD [[aggregate demand]] in the economy.
- Since from our understanding of the circular flow model, total expenses received by the firm are equal to the total incomes earned by the households. _related_ [[circular flow of income]]
- Therefore, the NI can also be indirectly measured by measuring the AD [[aggregate demand]]
- The aggregate demand faced by domestic firms comes from four entities
	- household,
	- government,
	- other firms, and
	- foreigners.
Household expenditure = consumption expenditure= C=Cd+Ci
Government expenditure= G= Gd+Gi
Firms expenditure= Investment expenditure= I= Id+ Ii
Foreigners expenditure= exports= X
- Total expenditure received by domestic firms= AD
	- AD= Cd=Gd+Id+X
= (C-Ci) + (G-Gi) + (I-Ii) +X
C+G+I+X-(Ci+Gi+Ii) ; imports are denoted by M ---> Ci+Gi+Ii= imports (m)
AD= C+G+I+(X-M)
