# presiding officers of house
(5:21 pm)
-   **speaker of lok sabha**
-   appointment: voting in ls. usually, speaker belongs to ruling party/coalition.
-   _protem_ speaker: **temporary speaker** appointed for presiding over house for election of speaker & administering oath to members. seniormost member of ls is appointed as protem speaker (as per a convention).
-   deputy speaker: [[election]] also takes in same manner as that of speaker. deputy speaker is chosen from opposition (convention) to ensure neutrality in functioning of ls.
-   removal of speaker of lok sabha: house can remove speaker through a [[resolution]] passed by effective majority which means more than 50% of total strength needs to vote for removing speaker. this is done as per articles 94 _[[a94]]_ & 96 _[[a96 The Speaker or the Deputy Speaker not to preside while a resolution for his removal from office is under consideration]]_ . a speaker can also tender his resignation to deputy speaker.
# concept of casting vote
-   salaries & allowances -> part of 'charged expenditure' upon consolidated fund of india-> to ensure their independence.
-   **roles & functions** 
-   speaker **presides** over meetings in lower house. in other words, speaker conducts business in lok sabha by ensuring discipline & decorum among members.
-   s/he **guards rights & privileges** of members of lok sabha, deciding who should speak at what time, questions to be asked, order of proceedings to be followed, among others.
-   a speaker uses his/her power to vote, in order **to resolve a deadlock**. that is, when house initiates a voting procedure, speaker does not cast a vote in 1st instance. it's only when 2 sides receive equal number of votes that speaker's vote breaks deadlock, making his/her position impartial.
-   in absence of a **quorum** in house, it's duty of speaker to adjourn house or to suspend any meeting, until a quorum is met.
-   speaker **decides agenda** that must be discussed in a meeting of members of parliament.
-   speaker is invested with immense powers of interpreting rules of procedure. since s/he is a member of house as well as presiding officer, s/he **ensures discipline** of house. speaker ensures that mps are punished for unruly behavior.
-   a speaker can also **disqualify** a member of parliament from house on grounds of defection (under **tenth schedule** of constitution).
-   a member who flouts speakerâ€™s orders or directions may be named by speaker & in such cases, member may have to withdraw from house. s/he also issues warrants to execute orders of house, wherever necessary & delivers reprimands on behalf of house.
-   speaker also **permits various parliamentary procedures** like motion of adjournment, motion of no confidence, motion of censure, among others.
-   speaker **presides over joint sitting** of 2 houses of parliament.
-   once a **money bill** is transmitted from lower house to upper house, **speaker is solely responsible for endorsing** his or her certificate on bill. in other words, s/he is given pivotal power to decide whether any bill is a money bill. his/her decision is considered final.
-   except for no-confidence motion, all other motions which come before house come only after speaker permits them.
### instances of misuse of  position of speaker
-   (06:09 pm)
-   in case of anti-defection law partiality towards their party
-   certifying a bill as a money bill in arbitrary manner
-   adjourning house to favor ruling party
-   not accepting 'point of order'
-   non-acceptance of motions
-   giving more time to speak to ruling party
-   misuse of breach of privileges of parliament
### way forward
-   foll uk ex: once a speaker always a speaker- will help in making speaker neutral & unbiased by removing insecurity.
-   a money bill should be decided by a [[committee]] formed for purpose & not by speaker alone.
-   anti defection law-> recommendation should be sought from election commission of india
-   bar speaker from holding any office of profit after he/she ceases to be a speaker
-   appoint people of highest integrity to post of speaker

**parliamentary privileges (7:47 pm)**
-   parliamentary privilege refers to rights & immunities enjoyed by parliament as institution & mps in their individual capacity, without which they cannot discharge their functions as entrusted upon them by constitution.
-   articles **105 & 194**
-   **two types:** individual privileges & collective privileges
-   **collective privileges**
-   right to publish their proceedings & restrain others from doing so
-   making rules for business conduct
-   punishing members & non-members for breach of privileges & contempt 
-   **individual privileges**
-   freedom from arrest during & +/- 40 days of session
-   cannot be compelled to be a witness in court
-   **sources of parliamentary privileges in india**
-   constitution
-   rules & procedures of houses of parliament
-   statutes
-   conventions
-   **what is a breach of privilege?**
-   a breach of privilege is a violation of any of privileges of mps/parliament. among other things, any action 'casting reflections' on mps, parliament, or its committees; could be considered a breach of privilege. this may include publishing of news items, editorials, or statements made in newspaper/magazine/tv interviews or in public speeches.Â 
-   **issues with non-codification of parliamentary privileges**:
-   open to interpretation
-   prone to misuse
-   lack of transparency
-   **reason for non-codification**: lack of political will; fear of judicial scrutiny, etc
-   **no, they shouldnâ€™t be codified**
-   blurred lines b/w contempt & bop
-   would hamper powers of presiding officers
-   bring privileges in conflict with fr
-   fewer instances of misuse
-   **way ahead**
-   till now parliament has not attempted to codify its privileges. reasons may be that parliament fears losing its supreme power when codified law would come under judicial scrutiny. this is affecting fundamental rights of citizens & it's not way a democracy should function.
-   knowing intention of parliamentarians, supreme court should give legislature a deadline for codifying its privileges so that further abuse of privileges is prevented.
-   finally, unless privileges are codified & relation b/w privileges & fundamental rights is balanced, present scenario should be improved. 1 possible solution could be making privilege committee as impartial as possible. since it's this committee that recommends whether there has been a breach & what punishment can be accorded to person, it should follow all procedures of natural justice.
-   moreover, privilege committee should be prevented from being judge in its own cause.
