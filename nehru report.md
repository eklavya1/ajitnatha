The Nehru Report of 15 August 1928 (approved on 28 August) was a memorandum to appeal for a new dominion status and a federal set-up of government for the constitution of India. It also proposed for the Joint Electorates with reservation of seats for minorities in the legislatures. It was prepared by a committee of the All Parties Conference chaired by Motilal Nehru with his son Jawaharlal Nehru acting as a secretary. There were nine other members in this committee. The final report was signed by Motilal Nehru and Jawaharlal Nehru, Ali Imam, Tej Bahadur Sapru, Madhav Shrihari Aney, Mangal Singh, Shuaib Qureshi, Subhas Chandra Bose, and G. R. Pradhan.[1]

The report called for:
• Immediate Dominion status for India.
• India to be a federation with two-chamber parliament.
• Not separate electorates for any community or weightage for minorities.
• No state religion and men and women should have equal rights as citizens.
• Hindi to be made the official language of India.

Gandhi proposed a resolution saying that that British should be given one year to accept the recommendations if the Nehru report or a campaign if non-cooperation should begin. The resolution was passed.
