The pyramidal representation of trophic levels of different organisms based on their ecological position (producer to final consumer) is called an ecological [[pyramid]].
The pyramid consists of a number of horizontal bars depicting specific trophic levels. The length of each bar represents the total number of individuals or biomass or [[energy]] at each trophic level in an [[ecosystem]].
