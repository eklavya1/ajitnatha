## factors
1. insolation / latitude
2. wind - regions where westerlies [[geo 23]] are active, ocean temp is a bit higher than regions of polar winds
3. [[ocean currents]] - warm ocean currents increases [[temperature]] of oceans & cold ocean...vice versa. ocean currents help in heat balance b/w equatorial & polar regions _related_ [[britain]] | [[navy]] | [[naval power]] [[warm oceanic currents]] 
4. continents / land mass - seas which are completely surrounded will have higher water temp due to continental effect. [[continentality]] `04:38 pm 20/9/2021`

- ocean waters can be diffiated into 3 layers of diff temp- #pneumonic `eth`
		1. *epilimnion*
				- it's zone upto 200 m with average temp of 20-25 deg celc
				- it's `zone of constant sunlight & mixing due to winds`
		2. *thermolimnion / metalimnion*
				- `temp in this zone decr rapidly with depth`
				- with very faint sunlight, zone is c/a as `twilight zone`.  #pre 
		3. *hypolimnion*
				- zone of uniform & very cold temp with average of 4 deg celcius
				- totally a `dark zone`
- horizontal distribution
		- surf temp of ocean waters lie b/w 20-25 deg celc in tropical regions & decreases gradually towards polar regions
		- 3 distinctive layers are visible along tropical regions but along polar regions, there will be a single uniform layer of cold temp

# summary

geography class 29

**last class revision:**

-   various climatic regions.
-   previous year questions.

**koeppen classification**

-   it was done in 1918 & most widely used climatic classification.
-   a-tropical: average temperature of closest month is 18 degrees or higher.
-   b- dry climates: potential evaporation exceeds precipitation.
-   c- warm temperate: average temperature of closest month of climates years is higher than minus 3 degrees but below 18 degrees celsius. 
-   d- clod snow forest climates: average temperature of coldest month is minus 3 degrees celsius or below.
-   h- high land: cold due to elevation.
-   f- means forest usually referring to thick forest, esp evergreen forest.
-   m- means monsoon.
-   s- summer dry.
-   w-winter dry.
-   s- means semi-arid.
-   w- means deserts: further "h" is hot & "k" is cold.
-   t-tundra.
-   f-frozen.
-   a--->b---->c indicate decrease in temprature.

**oceanography**

-   oceanography is study of oceans.
-   oceans cover 2/3rd of earth's surface.
-   **ocean bottom topography:**
-   4000 million years ago oceans were formed.
-   2 diff categories of ocean topography: major(big) & minor topographical features. 
-   **major features:**
-   continental self.
-   continental slope.
-   mid-oceanic ridges.
-   trenches.
-   abyssal plains.
-   **minor features**:
-   submarine canyon.
-   seamount.
-   guyots
-   islands.
-   **continental shelf:**
-   they are submerged shallow portion of continental crust.
-   depth varies b/w 150-200m.
-   it's very rich in sunlight oxygen & nutrient, which favor growth of plankton making continental shelf rich in life.
-   width of shelf is dependent on slope of adjacent land. it's wider along coastal plains & narrow along mountainous coast
-   **continental  slope:**
-   it's boundary b/w continent & oceans & forms outer edge of continents.
-   it's much steeper than continental shelf.
-   **[[continental rise]]:**
-   it's base of continental slope with very little gradient. & continues into abyssal plain.
-   **submarine canyons:**
-   there are canyons formed along continental slopes due to [[turbidity]] currents of rivers entering oceans.
-   **abyssal plains**:
-   also c/a oceanic basins.
-   they are tectonically inactive ocean floors with relatively smooth surfaces made up of oceanic sediments.
-   depth varies b/w 3000-6000 meters.
-   **seamount**: there are isolated volcanic mountains along oceanic floors formed due to volcanic activity along with hot spots.
-   **guyots:** seamount is sharply pointed whereas guyots are flat-topped hills with summits below water level.
-   **islands:** it's seamount that has emerged above surface of seawater.
-   **island arc:** it's chain of volcanic islands, generally convex toward open ocean.
-   **mid-oceanic ridges**: are formed due to divergence of oceanic plates.
-   **trenches**: they are deepest part of ocean formed long boundaries of oceans due to convergent plate boundaries.

**ocean temperature.**

-   **factors affecting ocean temperature:**
-   insolation or latitude.
-   winds: in regions where westerlies are more active ocean temperature is a bit higher than regions of polar winds.
-   oceans currents:
-   warm ocean current increases temperature of oceans & cold oceans currents decreases.
-   ocean current helps in heat balance & polar regions.
-   continent or landmass: sea which is completely surrounded will have higher water temperature due to continental effect.

**distribution** **of** **ocean water temperature.**

-   **vertical distribution**
-   temperature of water decrease with depth however pattern of decrease is not uniform across all latitudes.
-   ocean waters can be diffiated into 3 layers of diff temperatures: 
-   **epilimnion**: ^f5a3cd
-   it's topmost layer & zone up to 200 meters with average temperatures b/w 20-25 degrees celsius.
-   zone of constant sunlight & mixing due to winds.
-   **metalimnion**(thermocline): 
-   temperature in this zone decreases rapidly with depth.
-   with very faint sunlight, zone is c/a twilight zone.
-   **hypolimnion:**
-   it's zone of uniform & very cold temperatures. with average of 4 degrees celsius.
-   it's totally a dark zone with no sunlight.
-   **horizontal distribution of ocean temperature:**
-   surface temperature of ocean waters lie b/w 22-25 degree celsius in tropical regions & decreases gradually towards polar regions.
-   3 distinctive layers are visible along tropical regions but along polar regions, there will be a single uniform layer of cold temperatures.

**topic for next class**: **salinity, oceanic deposits, & oceanic currents.**
