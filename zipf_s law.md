	- human languages, including English, **follow a power law curve** called Zipfâ€™s law: a **very small set of words makes up the vast majority of actual usage**. Based on an analysis of The Brown Corpus (1964), a 1 million-word collection of 500 modern English documents, only 135 words account for 50 percent of all English usage. The word "the" itself accounts for 7.5 percent, while "of" accounts for 3.5 percent.
