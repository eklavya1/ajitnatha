the chenab river () is a major river that flows in india and pakistan, and is one of the 5 major rivers of the punjab region. it is formed by the union of two headwaters, chandra and bhaga, which rise in the upper himalayas in the lahaul and spiti district of himachal pradesh, india. chenab flows through the jammu region of jammu and kashmir, india into the plains of punjab, pakistan, before ultimately flowing into the indus river.

the waters of the chenab were allocated to pakistan under the terms of the indus waters treaty. india is allowed non-consumptive uses such as power generation. the chenab river is extensively used in pakistan for irrigation. its waters are also transferred to the channel of the ravi river via numerous link canals.
