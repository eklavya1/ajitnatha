The TX2 goal is a global commitment to double the [[world]]'s wild [[tiger]]s by [[2022]].
TX2 stands for *'Tigers times two'*, signaling the goal to double wild tigers.
From a population of perhaps 100,000 a century ago, wild tiger [[number]]s hit an all-time low of as few as 3,200 in [[2010]].
That same year, all 13 tiger range [[government]]s came together for the first time at the St Petersburg Summit where they committed to double the number of wild tigers by 2022, the next Chinese Year of the Tiger.
WWF played a critical role in creating a shared vision for tiger conservation by committing to the same goal.

Pilibhit Tiger Reserve has won the inaugural TX2 Award, presented by CATS, Global Tiger Forum, IUCN, UNDP, The Lion's Share, and WWF, for its remarkable contribution to
tiger conservation.
The awards celebrate the 10-year anniversary of all 13 Tiger Range Countries committing to double the global population of wild tigers by 2022 - a goal known as TX2.
