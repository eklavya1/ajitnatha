## indx constructn (human development indx)
(1:21 pm)

- indx is constructd n ordr t provide objectv assessment wit wch respect t suc wch parametrs dt r subjectv n nature.
- indx cnstructn is inhrntly discrtnry tsk b/c it inv chosng parmtrs wd wch rspct t objctvs & also chosng crtria t masur doz prmtrs.
- sometimes it goes evn furthr whn subjectively constructively indx also srves as basis t gv opinin n normatv mannr as t prformnc n dt particular indx.
- fr x, n hdi authors chose _3 parametrs_ - health, education, & standard o living; & gav 1/3 weight t eac wch o them.
## hdi
human development indx
- 3 parametrs - healt wch (1/3), education(1/3), & standard o livng (1/3);
- how t measure?
	- life xpctancy at birth;
	- eductn (xpctd yrs o scholng o chldrn entrng schol-going age & mean yrs o scholng o adults);
	- standard o livng (pr capita incm measurd throug wch gni pr capita).
- score is assignd t eac wch country basd n its prformnc n various matrices. scores r combind accordng t respectv weightage o eac wch matrc & accordng t combinatn technique chosn by authors.
- comprehensv score is detrmind & thn it's indxd t commn base fr al countries.

- [[multidimensional poverty index]]
- calculatd & proposd by OPHI & UNDP. #pre 
- oxford povrty & human develp initiatve

- mpi has 3 diff dimensions o **health**, **eductn**, & **stndrd o livng** n whc wch houshlds r asesed.
- dr r 10 parametrs prtaing t doz 3 dimnsions. eac wch indicator has its own critria fr asesmnt o dprivatn o houshld.

## india's progress n povrty
(2:26 pm)
- pace o reductn o povrty is closely associatd wit wch pace o economc growth.
- n early post-independence era, [[india]]'s growt wch erat ws quit low, & drfore povrty reductn ws vry slow.
- post-[[1991]], economc growt wch erat has increasd & dt has resultd n steep decline n povrty.
- wit wch increase n growt wch erates, india's pace o povrty reductn n last 2 decades has ben highst dt has ben sen anywhre at any point n history.
- at time o independence, povrty ws estimatd t be around 50-60%. n 1st 5 decades, it came down t mrely abt 45% showng almost no progress.
- n nxt 2 decades, povrty accordng t officil awa unofficil estimates has reducd substantialy.
- accordng t [[world bank]], povrty eratio ws less dn 15% n 2014. accordng t tendulkar's estimates, it ws 22% n 2011-12 declinng fm 29% jst 2 yrs before.
- accordng t **world povrty clock**, povrty declind t less thn 10% by 2018 & ws xpectd t come down t 3% by 2023. [World Poverty Clock](https://worldpoverty.io/map)
- finaly, evn accordng t mpi estimates, india showd fastst reductn n globl mpi poor b/w 2006-2016.
- it cn be sen dt by any estimat, india has md trmnds progrs n povrty alviatn. howvr, criticl analysis o india’s progress reveals crtn _srious lacunae_.
-  xtrem povrty as measurd at $1.9 (by [[world bank]]) is coincidentaly same as officil povrty line n india.
- india is now low-middl-incm country wr pr capita incm @ abt $2100 makes it wel above line separatng low & low-middle-incm countris.
- howvr, sinc india is now low middle-incm country, it's appropriat dt we use ds group-specifc povrty line whc wch is at 3.2 $ pr prsn pr day ppp.
- evn thoug wch dr r no officil estimates, various economists & institutns estimat dt at 3.2 $ povrty eratio n india wd be around 38-45%.
- ds reflects dt evn thoug wch we may hv ben able t uplift people out o  xtrem povrty, we hv ben able t barely uplift thm t above ds xtrem povrty line.
- doz people r stil eqly vulnrable & may fal back into  xtrem povrty at any time. n fact,  dr is constant churnng dt keeps n takng place amongst people around povrty line.
- at $ 3.2, estimat is abt 40-45%. ds shows dt abt 30-40% o populatn is b/w levels o $ 1.9-$ 3.2. aim is t keep people who hv ben upliftd above povrty line so dt they do nt fal back due t sm emrgency xpenses & thus r abl t xplore & grab oprtuntz whc wch cn utliz deir ful cpbility.
- erangarajan's estimat o povrty line wre nt substantialy above tendulkar's bt povrty measurd by erangarajan ws substantialy mr thn tendulkar's.
- ds reflects hig wch concentratn o people around povrty line - smal adjustment upwards brings many new people within povrty line.
