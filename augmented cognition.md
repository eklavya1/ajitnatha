- augmented cognition is an interdisciplinary area of psychology and engineering, attracting researchers from the more traditional fields of human-computer interaction, psychology, ergonomics and neuroscience. augmented cognition research generally focuses on tasks and environments where humanâ€“computer interaction and interfaces already exist. developers, leveraging the tools and findings of neuroscience, aim to develop applications which capture the human user's cognitive state in order to drive real-time computer systems. in doing so, these systems are able to provide operational data specifically targeted for the user in a given context. three major areas of research in the field are: cognitive state assessment (csa), mitigation strategies (ms), and robust controllers (rc). a subfield of the science, augmented social cognition, endeavours to enhance the "ability of a group of people to remember, think, and reason."
