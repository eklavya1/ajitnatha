- â€¢ The Channar revolt, Channar Lahala or Mura Murakkal Saharam took place from 1813 in [[Travancore]], modern day [[Kerala]]. In 19th century Travancore, baring of one's chest to higher status people was considered a sign of respect by both males and females. Thus, those of the lower status castes, such as the Nadar climbers and [[Ezhavas]], had to bare their chest in the presence of members of the higher-ranked Nair caste, who in turn had to do so in the presence of the still higher ranked Nambudiri Brahmins. The Brahmins, being at the pinnacle of the [[Hindu]] ritual ranking system known as varna, bared their chest only in the presence of a deity. Lower-caste women who wore clothes that covered their breasts had to pay a punitive breast tax to the state. The Nadar [[women]] successfully campaigned to be allowed to cover their breasts. In 1813, Colonel John Munro, [[British]] dewan in the Travancore court, issued an order granting permission to women converted to Christianity to wear upper cloth. The order was withdrawn when pindakars, members of the Raja's council, complained about this, arguing that this right would obliterate caste-differences, and lead to widespread pollution in the state.In 1858, new violence broke out in several places in Travancore. On 26 July 1859, under [[pressure]] from Charles Trevelyan, the Madras Governor, the king of Travancore issued a proclamation proclaiming the right for all Nadar [[women]] to cover their breasts, either by wearing jackets, like the Christian Nadars, or tie coarse-cloth around their upper-body, like the Mukkavattigal (fisher-women)
