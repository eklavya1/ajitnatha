Deflation is a decline in general price levels throughout an [[economy]], typically associated with a contraction in the supply of [[money]] and credit in the economy.
Deflation is the opposite of [[inflation]], which represents widespread price increases of goods and services in an economy.

[[disinflation]] is a temporary slowing of the pace of price inflation.

Unlike deflation, which refers to the direction of prices, disinflation refers to the rate of change in the rate of inflation.
Deflation is mainly caused by shifts in supply and demand. Disinflation, on the other hand, shows the rate of change of inflation over time. The inflation rate is declining over time, but it remains positive.

During times of deflation, since the money supply is tightened, there is an increase in the value of money, which increases the real value of debt.
Inflation increases the price of goods and services over time, effectively decreasing the number of goods and services one can buy with a dollar in the future as opposed to a dollar today. This effectively decreases the [[time]] value of money. Since inflation is positive during disinflation, the value of money declines.
