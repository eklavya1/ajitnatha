The EAG was established in [[2004]], the founding conference was held in [[moscow]] on [[October]] 6, 2004, and was attended by six founding countries: [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[China]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]] and [[Tajikistan]] and was not established under the aegis of EAS. Also, the grouping is currently an associate member of the FATF.
The EAG is a regional body comprising nine countries: [[India]], Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Belarus]]. In [[2005]] and [[2010]] the group was expanded to include Uzbekistan (2005), Turkmenistan (2010) and India (2010) which previously had observer status.
It develops and conducts joint activities aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
It assists member states in implementing the 40 FATF anti-money laundering operations and the 9 special FATF Recommendations on combating terrorist financing.
The EAG was created for the countries of the Eurasian region not included in the existing FATF-style regional groups and is intended to play an important role in reducing the threat of intemational terrorism and ensure the transparency, reliability and security of the financial systems of states and their further integration into the international infrastructure for combating money laundering and terrorism financing (AMLICFT).
The Agreement on the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism was signed in Moscow in June 2011 , granting the EAG the status of a regional intergovernmental organization. Today the EAG brings together nine countries in the region (Belarus, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan). Observer status has been granted to 15 countries and 23 intemational organizations.
