quit india movement (august kranti), august 1942, was launched in response to mahatma gandhi's national call for satyagraha. 
all-india congress committee proclaimed a mass protest demanding what gandhiji c/a "an orderly british withdrawal" from india.
it was for determination, which appears in his call to "do or die", issued on 8 august at gwalior tank maidan in mumbai in 1942.
congress working committee meeting held at wardha on 14 july 1942 passed a resolution demanding complete independence from british govemment.
draft proposed massive civil disobedience if british did not accede to demands.
jawaharlal nehru & maulana azad were apprehensive & critical of call, but backed it & stuck with gandhi's leadership until end.
sardar vallabhbhai patel, dr. rajendra prasad, aruna asaf ali, achyut patwardhan, & dr. anugrah narayan sinha openly & enthusiastically supported such a disobedience movement, as did many veteran gandhians & socialists like asoka mehta & jayaprakash narayan.
allama mashriqi (head of khaksar tehrik) was c/a to join quit india movement.
although at national level ability to galvanize rebellion was limited, movement is notable for regional success esp at satara in maharashtra, talcher in orissa, & midnapore.
in tamluk & contai subdivisions of midnapore, local populace was successful in establishing parallel govts, which continued to function, until gandhi personally requestee leaders to disband in [[1944]].
a minor uprising took place in ballia, now easternmost district of uttar pradesh.
people overthrew district administration, broke open jail, released arrested congress leaders, & established their own independent rule.
it took weeks before british could reestablish their writ in district.
