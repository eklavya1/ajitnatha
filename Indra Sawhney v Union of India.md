The Supreme Court while upholding the 27% quota for backward classes.
SC in the same case also upheld the principle that the combined reservation beneficiaries should not exceed 50% of India's population.
The concept of 'creamy layer' also gained currency through this judgment and provision that reservation for backward classes should be confined to initial appointments only and not extend to promotions.
A nine-judge bench in the Indra Sawhney case (famously known as the Mandal Commission case) imposed the ceiling of 50% on total reservation.
Any new disputes regarding criteria were to be raised in the Supreme Court only.
Notwithstanding the judgement passed by the Supreme Court, since the Indira Sawhney judgment in 1992, many states have passed laws breaching the limit of 50% such as Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.
