- sagittarius - black hole @ milky way 的 centre
- andromeda- nearest galaxy
- sirius - brightest 星星 里 د sky
- [[proxima centauri]] - nearest 星星 to sun

# pole stars
里 د 北 hemisphere  - polaris
里 د 南 hemisphere  - sigma octantis (但 不 a very bright 星)

- angle of pole star decreases towards equator. at equator, angle is 0 degree & it's 90 degree at poles.
- it's gradual change in angle of pole star from pole to equator proves spherical shape. ^6b2045

life cycle of a star (stellar nebula-> avg. star-> red giant-> planteray nebula-> white dwarf; massive star-> red supergiant-> supernova-> neutron star/ black hole)

galaxy

it's a sprawling system of gas, dust, & stars held together by gravity.
all galaxies contain a supermassive black hole at their center.
types of galaxies
spiral galaxy: with spiral arms; relatively flat disc appearance with a central bulge.
elliptical galaxy: it's a spherical or oval-shaped galaxy with a fairly uniform distribution of stars.
irregular galaxy: with no definite shape or structure.
other facts:
our galaxy is milkyway galaxy.
sun is located in orion's arm.
andromeda: nearest galaxy.
proxima centauri: nearest sun
sirius: brightest star in sky.

twinkling of stars

due to turbulence in atmosphere, light coming from stars is more deflected as it comes from a point source.
light from star travels a very long distance, whereas lights from planet travel shorter path & they don't come from a point source. 
light year-> it's distance traveled by light in 1 year at speed of 3x10^8 m/s.
constellation: group of stars forming a recognizable pattern. eg: big dipper (saptarshi mandal)
pole star- it's star that is aligned with axis of rotation of earth because of which it appears stationary throughout night.

origin of solar system:

evolutionary theories

material of solar system condensed into sun & other planets simultaneously as isolated masses of matter from a single cloud of gas,i.e., both sun & planets are of same age. 
gaseous hypothesis- by kant, there were cold & hard particles that collided with each other due to gravitational attraction. collision released heat & gradually formed a rotating nebula kind of structure from which rings of matter were thrown off.
nebular hypothesis- by laplace- it assumes a pre-existing nebula in a rotating state
gradual pulling of nebula shrank this led to more spinning & formation of a flat disk.
rings of matter got separated from this disk & condensed to form planets

catastrophic theories or binary theory

planetesimal hypothesis- by chamberlin & moulton
proto-star is accompanied by a companion star
this companion star exerts a gravitational pull, led to ejection of matter from proto-star. this ejected matter evolved into planet & started revolving around sun.
tidal hypothesis- by genes & jeffry
it proposes a very big intruding star which came near to sun,
gravitational pull led to ejection of tides of material that formed planets over period of time.

sun

sun constitutes 99.8% of mass of solar system.
interior layers of sun:
core: innermost layer of sun's interior where nuclear fusion reaction happens; it has highest temperature which is 15 million degrees c.
radiative zone: energy from core is carried outward by radiation through this zone.
convective zone: where heat through convection currents reaches surface.
atmospheric layers: 
photosphere: lowest layer of sun's atmosphere; visible light originates from this zone; temp: 5500 degrees c; it's brightest layer of sun.
chromosphere: intermediate zone which appears like a red rim during eclipse. 
corona: uppermost layer; visible only during total solar eclipse; it's hotter than photosphere with temperature reaching 2 million degrees celsius; crown-like structure.
key terms:
solar flare- sudden burst of storm of hot atoms released into space 
sunspot- these are dark portions on photosphere with reduced temperature but strong magnetic activity
solar maxima are time when a high number of sunspots are visible & vice-versa
number of sun-spots on surface increases or decreases over a regular period of 11 years (solar cycle or sunspot cycle)

planets: 

terrestrial planets (earth-like) & jovian planets (jupiter like)
differences b/w terrestrial & jovian planets
terrestrial planets 	jovian planets
earth-like 	jupiter like
rocky 	gas
smaller in size 	huge
strong solar winds 	less
thin/no atmosphere 	thick atmosphere
less no. of satellites 	large no. of satellites
no rings 	rings
speed of rotation lower 	very high speed of rotation
mercury- smallest, nearest to sun, no atmosphere 
venus- earth's twin, hottest (very high greenhouse effect due to presence of co2)
earth- blue planet; densest planet of all. 
mars- red planet, possibility of life; due to its presence in goldilocks zones- habitable regions in universe
