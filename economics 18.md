[[c12 ch 2 economics national income accounting]]
## national income accounting (nia)
(1.16 pm)
firms & households explained (1.20 pm)
dictation (2.10 pm)
- in nia we try to measure incomes earned in a nation. to do this, we 1st define wt income is & wt a nation is.
- in order to measure national income, then, we visualize from where & in wt manner is income earned.
- further, we also look at alternative ways in which incomes generated in economy cn be measured.

## circular flow of income model
- [[circular flow of income]] [[velocity of circulation of money]]
- circular flow model helps in visualizing process of income generation & therefore, its measurement.
- in [[economy]], there are 2 basic entities- firms & households.
- they interact with each other in goods & factor market.
- need for firms arises b/c households dema & goods.
- in order to produce goods, a sp entity dt is firm needs to be set up.
- for firm to func, [[4 factors of production]] (fop) are needed.
- these are:
	- [[entrepreneurship]]: entrepreneur is a person who is willing to perform task of assembling all necessities required to commence production process.
	- he/ she also bears risk associated with production. [[elon musk]] [[tony stark]] 
	- in return, entrepreneur earns a [[profit]].
	- [[land]] - space (physical or virtual) needed to commence production.
	- [[labour]] - workers required to work in firm.
	- [[capital]] - initial money needed for firm to buy items & machinery to start production. 

- [[income]]s are defined as payments md in return for factors of production.
- households provide these *fop*s & earn factor payments in return.
- against land, they earn rent, for capital they earn interest, & for providing labor they earn wages.
- [[entrepreneurship]] is also provided by household which earns profits. it's not necessary dt firm'll transfer all profits back to household.
- however, for simplification, let us assume it does.
- further, we consider dt households hv some initial money to spe & & dt firm is able to sell all dt it produces.
- in goods market, firm produces goods & sells them to households.
- in order to produce goods, firms buy factors of production from households from factors market & mk factor payments in return.
- households spent money to buy goods which firms use to pay for fop.
- in ds way, money keeps on circulating in economy.
- circular flow model concludes dt value of goods produced is equal to value of expenditure received which is equal to value of factor payments done.
- kindly draw diagram (2.30 pm)
- value of good produced (a)= value of expenditure received (b)= value of income received (c)
## assumptions
- basically given economy is a [[closed system]]
- goods produced are sold & there is no [[inventory]].
- households do not save i.e. they spe & all incomes received.
- there is no govt collecting [[tax]]es.
- there are no foreigners from where households cn import goods or to whom firms cn sell.
- goods produced by firm continue to be in dema & ie households do not change their preferences.
- there are no financial institutions dt provide facilities of deposits & loans.
- given these assumptions, national incomes are simply sum of all income received provided by fop
- therefore, national income is equal to rent+wages+interest+profits.
- alternatively, it's also equal to value of goods produced (a) & value of expenditures (b).
- in above model, incomes remain in static equilibrium with value of goods produced & expenses.

## dynamic equilibrium model

## circular flow with injections & leakages

- [[injection]]s
	- are those transactions dt increase magnitude of flow of [[money]] in [[economy]].
	- anything which causes increase in [[expenditure]] received in or incomes earned or value of goods produced is termed injection.
	- usually, we refer to investment, govt expenditure, & exports from economy as injections.

- [[leakage]]s
	- anything dt leads to a reduction in magnitude of incomes earned or expenditures done or value of goods produced.
	- exs are savings, taxes, & imports.
	- for ex, savings reduce proportion of income dt households spent. as a result, expenditures received by firms reduce, & therefore, need for firm to produce goods reduces.
	- as a result, value of goods produces declines & therefore, value of fop utilized also reduces.
	- ds results in fewer factor payments being done by firm.
	- hence, reducing incomes received by households.
- *if we observe value of a, b, & c, in ds model at a particular point of time, then it may not be equal as in above case saving may cause a discrepancy b/w incomes & expenses.
- however, savings simply set in motion dt causes incomes earned, eventually reduce to level of expenditures received by firms.
- therefore, a, b, & c are in a [[dynamic equilibrium]] rather than being in [[static equilibrium]].
- a similar change in equilibrium cn be visualized in case of taxes dt govt collects & expenditures dt households incur in buying goods from foreign firms (ie imports)
- all such leakages reduce incomes earned, expenditures received, & value of goods produced.
- on other hand, injections such as investments dt are expenditure done by firms in buying capital goods from other firms, increase value of factor services required.
- thereby, it creates a greater flow of incomes to households & thus economy wd be in increasing equilibrium.
- a similar effect cn be visualized when govt spends money or when domestic firms export to foreigners.
- number of expenditures receive by firms' increases, causing in motion a process to increase in incomes & value of goods produced.
- whether income'll grow or contract depends upon [[magnitude]] of injections & leakages.
- if injections are greater then economy wd be in a rising equilibrium & vice versa.
- sp entity govt is dt economic entity dt provides public goods & collects taxes in return. it demands goods produced by firms & provides factors of production which enable households to securely provide their factors of production. #doubt 
- sp entity financial institutions: are ones dt provide avenues of savings to households & a source to raise capital for investment purposes to firm.
