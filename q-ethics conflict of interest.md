# What is meant by conflict of interest? Illustrate with examples, the difference between the actual and potential conflicts of interest.
Conflict of interest is a situation when two or more than two parties have opposite view of the situation.It can be related to any condition but most commonly it is about sharing of resources.

It is problem is as old as time. no matter which era which nation which community people have always found themselves to be involved some kind of conflict with others. These days conflict of interest has taken a subtle form, people engage in ideological warfare as opposed to physical conflicts.
On a smaller scale we find conflict between a manager and workers under them. It can be between a teenager who wants to go and join his friends for a nightout and her conservative parents. It can be between a factory owner and the workers that she employs.

Actual conflict is when the parties involved not resolve their differences and hence opt for the socially approved method of resolving them. In the days of old where was the concept of [[lex talionis]], Which essentially means and eye for an eye. If you were wronged By someone then it was your legal right sanctioned by the divine law to take revenge. Most famous was the hammurabi code from ancient Mesopotamia.

The world has also witnessed wiring of fighters who can deliver justice to their sheer muscle power. The idea was that in a deadly duel the one who wins was able to do so because he was on the side of righteousness.

Potential conflicts is van there is a remote possibility of conflict between two or more actions we have seen this happening in political parties in religious groups in racial groups. These days government make sure that they have plans ready to prevent such future scenarios
