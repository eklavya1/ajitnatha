# poverty
- [[poverty]] is a state of being deprived. it is a condition wherein a person does not have enough resources, to meet basic requirements necessary for survival.
- [[world bank]] defines poverty as ‘pronounced deprivation in well-being comprising of multiple dimensions.
- it includes low incomes and the inability to acquire the basic goods and services necessary for _survival with dignity_.
- poverty also encompasses low levels of health and education, poor access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate physical security, lack of voice, and insufficient capacity and opportunity to better one's life.
## explanation of poverty
- defining poverty: [[world bank]] uses the concept of deprivation to define poverty. 
	- being deprived of [[income]].
	- being deprived of opportunities.
	- being deprived of basic necessities, health, political voice, etc.
- if a person is deprived of such dimensions, that person will be called as ‘poor’.
- poverty may include social, economic, and political elements. _related_ [[preamble#^3142ce]]
- well-being includes income, basic necessities, good and healthy environment, security, etc.
- while defining poverty our aim is to be as comprehensive as possible.
- at the same time, it should be recognized that these multiple dimensions of well-being are very subjective to assess.
- therefore while measuring poverty, we try to restrict ourselves to those dimensions that can be objectively measured. _what can be measured, can be improved_ [[peter thiel]] [[mba]]

# measurement of poverty
(2:27 pm)
- while measuring poverty, we choose objectively measurable aspects of well-being.
- the most commonly used aspect is consumption expenditure.  
- example:
	- we have to determine a level of [[consumption]] expenditure necessary to be considered as non-poor.
	- let us say if rs. 4500 is the limit below which people are considered poor
		- (among p1= rs 1000,
		- p2= 2000,
		- p3= 5000 and
		- p4= 6000), p1 and p2 will be called as poor. 
- standard to measure poverty must be accepted. 
- absolute poverty: when poverty is calculated against a measured baseline (e.g. rs 4500 in the above example). 

# types of poverty
## absolute poverty:
- poverty which is measured using set standards is called absolute poverty. 
- the standard against which some objective dimension of well-being is measured is called the _poverty line._ 
- these standards are _‘normative’_. i.e. they are proposed as opinions and may then be excepted or rejected. 
- once accepted, these proposals, become absolute standards. 
- those assessed to be below these standards are called ‘absolutely poor’, and those above are called non-poor.
- absolute poverty has no connotation with respect to extremity or intensity of poverty. 
- it simply lays down a standard, and assesses people to be either above or below, not how far above or how far below. 
- absolute poverty since is based on standards helps to assess a nation’s progress on alleviation of poverty. _related_ [[eluviation]] | [[illuviation]]
- the standards remain fixed in time and space. unless they are modified, i.e. the standards will remain the same and thus can be used to assess the progress.
- the authority, usually the government, may change the standards later on, on a new proposal, and then these new standards will remain fixed until some further modification takes place.

## relative poverty
(2:38 pm)
- relative poverty assesses poverty in a relative manner, i.e. through comparison. a person may be relatively poor or richer as compared to someone else.
- relative poverty s beter asessed via measurement of inequality. [[gini coefficient]] | [[kuznets curve]] | [[lorenz curve]] [[pareto principle]]

## measures related to poverty
(3:44 pm)
## poverty line: 
- poverty line is the defined standard to assess whether the person is poor or not.
- it is calculated using the _poverty line basket_.
## poverty line basket: 
- plb is the _basket of goods_ that is deemed to be considered as necessary to be consumed in order for a person/household to be considered as non-poor.
- the price of poverty line basket is in fact the poverty line. 
## headcount ratio: 
- hcr is the proportion of the [[population]] below poverty line. 
## poverty gap: 
- headcount ratio does not convey anything about the depth of poverty.
- depth of poverty means qualitative assessment about how deep in poverty a person/household who are poor are.
- poverty gap and [[squared poverty gap]] as measured to assess the depth of poverty.
- poverty gap measures the average distance of people from the poverty line for those people who are below the poverty line.
- squared poverty gap tries to assess a better depth by giving more weightage to the effort that a person farther away from the poverty line would have to undertake in order to escape poverty.
- it does so by squaring the distance that each person has from the poverty line.
	- first, we find the average distance squared and then take that square root of the number.
	- this is greater than the simple average as calculated using the poverty gap and therefore is able to assess the depth better.

the topic for the next class: various poverty estimates (continued).
## assignment
