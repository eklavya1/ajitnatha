importance of central asian republics with india - 09.35 am 

geo-economic - rich in oil, natural gas (turkmenistan has 1 of highest levels), mineral resources such as gold etc, very fertile lands representing wheat basket of asia.

india has a foreign airbase in farkhor in tajikistan.

importance of india for central asian republics - 09.54 am 
importance of india for central asian republics - 09.54 am 

they seek greater engagement with india to expand their room for strategic manoeuvre with 2 traditional powers in region namely russia & china. 
while central asian republics (cars) are eager to benefit from economic dynamism of china but have no interest in replacing moscow's suzerainty with chinese hegemony. 
they seek to learn from india's success in insulating its youth from islamic radicalisation. 
cooperation vis-a-vis developments in afghanistan. 

evolution of india-central asia relations - 10.07 am 
evolution of india-central asia relations - 10.07 am 

historically, india & central asia share civilizational, cultural, trade & people to people ties. buddhism spread from india to central asia while sufist ideas spread from central asia to india. 
these linkages are evident in similarities of languages, food, dress & culture. 
india had good relations with these republics when they were part of ussr. 
following disintegration of ussr, five cars (central asian republics) became independent in 1991, however, india was engaged in its restructuring of economy, wanted to pursue good relations with usa & its neighbourhood & as a consequence, could not prioritise its relations with central asia. 
though india launched look north policy in 1995, it remained a non-starter. since, india looks at this region more from a security perspective (civil war in tajikistan, taliban's takeover in afghanistan) than anything else. 
it was after 2 decades of tepid relations, ties b/w india & central asia have begun to improve. 
reasons for india's focus on region 
- identified it as an opportunity for trade & investment 
- china's growing footprint in region 
thus, india in 2012, launched 'connect central asia policy' with emphasis on 4 c's - commerce, connectivity, culture & consulate.
 major push to india's relations with region came with prime minister modi's visit to all five cars in 2015 to enhance defence, trade & energy links with region.
today, relations are flourishing
-india along with pakistan became full members of sco.
- india joined ashgabat agreement in 2018, 
- institutionalisation of india-central asia relations with launching of india-central asia annual summits in 2019 (first summit in 2019 took place in samarkand in uzbekistan, since then meetings have taken place virtually). 
ashgabat agreement in 2018 - 
-agreement aims to establish an international transport & transit corridor b/w uzbekistan, turkmenistan, iran & oman (aim is to connect central asia with persian gulf).
-qatar was a founding member but it withdrew its membership
-kazakhstan & pakistan joined agreement in 2016.
-india joined it in 2018.  

 initiatives - 10.38 am 
 initiatives - 10.38 am 

instc (international north-south transport corridor) - as an alternative route envisaged.
it connects bombay port to bandarban port in iran & then via caspian sea (baku - capital of azerbaijan) to moscow & then to st. petersburg. this route is going to reduce cost by 30 per cent & bring down transit time from 40 days (suez canal) by more than half.  
it envisions a 7200 km long multi-mode network of ships, rail & road routes for transporting freights. 
original agreement was signed in 2000 b/w iran, india & russia in st. petersburg. 
subsequently, ten other central asian & west asian countries - azerbaijan, armenia, (caucasian nations), kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan & tajikistan (central asian nations), ukraine & belarus. (russia, kazakhstan & belarus - founding members of eurasian economic union ), turkey, oman & syria. bulgaria is an observer country. 
problems associated with instc -
-chahbahar port at iran is to be developed by india but us has put sanctions on it. 
-not all central asian countries are part of it 
tapi gas pipeline -  it will connect gas produced at galkynysh gas fields to afghanistan (herat, farah, nimroz, helmand & kandhar provinces). then, it will enter pakistan (quetta & multan). from here, gas will be delivered to india-pakistan border in town of fazilka (punjab), covering a total distance of 1800 kms. 
all these projects are in lock jam & yet to be completed. 

challenges - 11.06 am 
challenges - 11.06 am 

lack of land access has resulted in weak trade relations with central asia. 
india's annual bilateral trade with region stands at around 2 billion dollars while that with china have already exceeded 41 billion dollars & that could double by 2030. 
india's total trade volume is mostly accounted for by kazakhstan energy exports to india. 
central asia is a landlocked region & india does not share borders with any of cars. 
-shortest land route passes through hostile pakistan & unstable afghanistan. 
-until recently, india's trade with region was conducted through china, however, recent border conflict has taken bilateral relations to nadir (lowest point) & therefore, land access via china remains precarious. 
india's failure to develop alternative routes to region to foster trade relations remains 1 of primary challenges india's trade relations face.
- india's option to access cars through iran chabahar port is limited by fact that it will involve investment in rail & road routes to iran's northern boundaries with cars. but, us sanctions on iran complicate such investments. 
-instc - yet not fully operational & 2 cars (uzbekistan & turkmenistan) are not members. 
-tapi gas pipeline - is not yet complete & india has been non-committal due to tensions with pakistan. 
afghanistan - after taliban takeover, it providing access to central asia remains precarious. 
thus, india's access to central asia remains precarious. 

steps taken by govt of india - 11.20 
steps taken by govt of india - 11.20 

india has supported multiple options of connectivity in region such as joining ashgabat agreement in 2018. 

break - 11.21 am - 11.29 am - 8 minutes 

evidence of china in central asian republic - 11.31 am 
evidence of china in central asian republic - 11.31 am 

significant trade partners 
with bri initiative, china has overthrown russia to emerge as biggest foreign investor in cars. 
presently, 20% of china's energy needs are met by central asian republics. 
china shares borders with 3 of five cars
china's trade links & growing political ties with region sits uncomfortably with indian policymakers. china's presence in indian ocean & in south asia when combined with its growing presence in central asia compounds india's concerns of potential chinese encirclement. 

regional organisations - 11.36 am 
regional organisations - 11.36 am 

csto - collective security treaty organisation
it was established in 1992 as an intergovtal military alliance but came into effect in 2002. it's also referred to as tashkent pact or tashkent treaty. 
six founding members are russia, armenia, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan & uzbekistan. 
in 1994, azerbaijan, georgia & belarus joined it. but later on azerbaijan, georgia & uzbekistan did not continue their membership of csto. therefore, present members are russia, belarus, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan & armenia. 
shanghai cooperation organization - it was established in 1996, then name of organisation was shanghai 5 - russia, china, tajikistan, kyrgyzstan, kazakhstan. 
in 2001, uzbekistan chose to join & name was changed to shangai 5 to sco. 
in 2017 - pakistan & india joined 2017 during astana summit. 
aim of organisation is to fight triple evils namely extremism, separatism & terrorism. 
other permanent body under sco is rats - regional anti-terrorist structure. its headquarters are in tashkent. 
driving philosophy of sco is shanghai spirit & this emphasizes harmony, working by consensus, non-interference in domestic affairs, non-alignment. 
like brics, sco is seen as an attempt by russia & china to challenge west dominated world order & counterbalance us's & activities of nato in central asia.
india cited non-alignment as 1 of principles of shanghai spirit as a counter to west's apprehension of its sco membership.  

significance of sco's membership to india - 12.01 am 
significance of sco's membership to india - 12.01 am 

sco's main objective to cooperate against triple evils is in consonance.
regular participation in rats, access to information on professional intelligence on terrorist groups via rats would help enhance india's security capabilities. 

challenges for india at sco - 12.04 am 
challenges for india at sco - 12.04 am 

vis-a-vis, terrorism cooperation 
-india's definition of terrorism is diff from sco's definition of terrorism. for sco, terrorism coincides with regime destabilisation whereas, for india, it's related to state-sponsored cross border terrorism.  
-sco targets groups like east turkistan islamic movement whereas lashkar-e-tayyiba, jaesh-e-mohammad etc are operational in india but do not come under ambit of sco anti-terrorist structure. 
within sco, leadership lies with china & india has to accept role of a 2nd fidel (secondary power) with which india, in general, is not comfortable.
china's bri - india's position to bri is contrary to other members of sco, all of which support bri. 
limited economic footprint of india. russia with central asia trade in 2017 was 10 billion dollars.

challenges for sco - 12.16 pm
challenges for sco - 12.16 pm

trust deficit b/w members like india & pakistan & india & china can act as a drag on effectiveness of organisation 
proliferations of other regional organisations like eurasian economic union, csto etc may pose a challenge for sco.

benefits of india's membership to sco - 12.18 pm 
benefits of india's membership to sco - 12.18 pm 

sco has been accused of a league of autocrats with anti-west agenda. membership of a neutral country like india will give greater acceptance to organisation. 

topics to be covered in next class - india-latin america, india & west asia.
