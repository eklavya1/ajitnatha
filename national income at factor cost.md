- national income from factor cost is also called [[national income]] of a country.
- national income means the sum of all incomes earned by the citizens in the form of rent, wages, interest and profits. hence, statement 1 is correct.
- the difference between national income at factor cost and national income at market price (nnpmp) arises from the fact that indirect taxes and subsidies cause the market price to be different from the factor income received by the citizens.
- for example, a mobile handset of rs10,000 purchased by you includes a gst of 12%. in this case, the market price of rs 10,000 includes the gst. the factor of production used to produce a mobile handset will only get rs 8800. thus, the difference between market price and factor cost is the tax.
- similarly, a subsidy results in the market price of a product being less than the factor cost.
- therefore, while calculating national income, we must deduct [[indirect tax]]es and add subsidies into net national product at market price.
- nnpfc = nnpmp - indirect taxes + subsidies.
