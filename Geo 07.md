- 4800 mya 都 海 formed
- 3500-2000 mya blue-green algae formed

# earth formation
earth formed as د part of [[nebula]] 哪 formed [[solar system]]
- [[nebular hypothesis]]
- [[eons]]
## origin 的 evolution 的 earth
- early atmosphere 
- degassing
- volcanic eruptions
- condenstion 的 水 vapor
- formation 的 海 
- blue green algae
- flooding 的 atmosphere 跟 o2

- 4800 mya , 都 海 生

1. 行星 earth, initially molten, volatile object (4800 mya)
2. due to gradual 提高 里 density, د process 的 separation 开始 causing heavier materials to sink towards د centre 的 earth 和 light ones to 移动  towards د surface


# eons

1. origin of 星星, supernova, big bang
2. hadean
3. archean
4. proterozoic

- oceanic crust is much younger than continental crust. age of rocks in oceanic crust is nowhere more than 200 million years old. some of continental rock formations are as old as 3,200 million years
- continental crust is much thicker when compared to oceanic crust. it has a thickness about 35 km., on plains, to as much as 70 km., on highest mountains.
- density of continental crust is much less as compared to oceanic crust. it has approximate value of 2.6 g/cm3, while density of oceanic crust is about 3.0 g/cm3.

## earth 的 移动 (movements)
- geomorphic processes
		1. endogenetic processes
		2. exogenetic processes

- earth‘s surface is being continuously subjected to external forces induced basically by energy (sunlight).that means, earth‘s surface is being continuously subjected to by external forces originating within earth‘s atmosphere & by internal forces from within earth. external forces are k/a exogenic forces & internal forces are k/a endogenic forces

- exogenic processes derive their energy from atmosphere determined by ultimate energy from sun & also gradients created by tectonic factors.while, energy emanating from within earth is main force behind endogenic geomorphic processes. this energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational & tidal friction & primordial heat from origin of earth. this energy due to geothermal gradients & heat flow from within induces diastrophism & volcanism in lithosphere.

- actions of exogenic forces result in wearing down (degradation) of relief/elevations & filling up (aggradation) of basins/ depressions, on earth’s surface. phenomenon of wearing down of relief variations of surface of earth through erosion is k/a gradation. endogenic forces continuously elevate or build up parts of earth’s surface & hence exogenic processes fail to even out relief variations of surface of earth
