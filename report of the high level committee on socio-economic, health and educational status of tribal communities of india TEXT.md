The Indian State must aim to ensure that all sections of society share in the economic and social prosperity or the country. It is widely acknowledged that a large section or the Indian population. especially the tribal communities, have not received the full benefits of development processes undertaken over the past six decades. Indeed. it is recognised that the tribal population has been adversely by the developmental projects undertaken during this period. It is imperative that the causes, circumstances and consequences of this situation are studied and analysed in detail in order to design appropriate interventional measures to remedy the current state or affairs and uphold the progressive principles enshrined in the Constitution or India.

Accordingly. the Prime Ministeös office constituted a High-Level Committee (I-ILC) in August 2014. consisting or the following members: Prof. Virginius Xaxa as Chairperson, Dr. Usha Ramanathan. Dr. Joseph Bara. Dr. K.K. Misra. Dr. Abhay Bang. Smt. Sunila Basant. and Dr. I-Irusikesh Panda. Secretary. Ministry or Tribal AfTairs. as Member-Secretary. The Committee was mandated to examine the socio-economic. educational and health status or tribal conununities and recommend appropriate interventional to improve the same. The Committee rormulated thematic sections based on various socio-economic parameters mentioned in the Terms of Reference and each theme was taken up by individual members based on their aras of expertise.

The decision or the Prime Ministeös Ollice to constitute this Committee is an indication of the Centre-s commitment to tribal welfare and willingness to make appropriate amendments in programmes and policies to alter the dismal situation of the tribal population in contemporary India. The HLC is honoured to have had the opportunity to prepare this report on a matter of immense importance for the country.

The Committee-s visits to various tribal areas and interactions with people have only strengthened our belief in the urgent need for rethinking the prevailing model of development and a shift in the State-s approach to the tribal question. The I•ILCk sincerely hopes that the recommendations be incorporated into State laws. policiesk and practices. Doing so is essential in order to strengthen existing and ruture programmes and laws for the Scheduled Tribes.

The task assigned to the Committee was formidable and challenging. The primary limitation faced by the HLC was that or inadequate time. Nonetheless. the Committee persevered to compile the report within the stipulated time period. While the report was to be submitted by May 13, 2014, the Committee has taken an additional two weeks for completion. The Chairperson wishes to express his sincere gratitude to all the members of the Committee for their time, effort and commitment in preparing this report, despite several other personal and professional obligations.

Such a mammoth exercise would have been impossible without the generous help of numerous individuals and organisations. The former Minister of Tribal AtTairs, Dr. Kishore Chandra Deo shared his insights into the conditions of tribals with the Committee at the very outset. The HLC is extremely grateful to him. We are thankful to the former Member-Secretary. Smt. Vibha Puri Das for setting in motion the work or the I-ILC and providing the impetus to take this report forward. furnishing logistical, moral and intellectual support until her retirement in December 2013. At the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, the Committee thanks the Deputy Director-General (Statistics), Dr. Siladitya Chaudhuri, for his dedicated efforts in the formation of task groups and initial collection of data. The HLC is also grateful to Joint Secretaries. Shri Ashok Pai and Shri Manoj Pingua (former Secretary, Tribal Welfare. Government of Chhattisgarh), and Economic Advisor. Smt. Sangeeta Verma for their help. Special thanks must go to Dr. Namita Priyadarshee. Director (High Level Committee) for her enormous efforts in ensuring the completion of the report. The staff and consultants at the HLC secretariat — Shri Harvinder Singh. Shri M.P. Saini, Ms. provided the Committee with Poonam Madhwal and Shri Sandeep Kumar — invaluable administrative support. without which our task could not have been accomplished successfully.

The HLC wishes to thank the office or the Registrar General or India. the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO). Chief Statistician or India and Secretary. Ministry of Statistics. Planning and Implementation (MoSPI) for providing the Committee with valuable statistical data. For sharing information on various developmental indices. we are extremely gratetill to the Ministry of Rural Development: Ministry of Micro. Small and Medium Enterprises: Ministry or Labour and Employment: Ministry of Agriculture (Department or Agriculture and Cooperation and Department of Animal Husbandry. Dairying and Fisheries): Ministry of Human Resource Development (Department or Higher Education and Department of School Education and Literacy): Ministry or I-lealth and Family Welt-are (Department of Health and Family Welfare and Deparunent or AYUSI l) and Ministr> of Social Justice and Empowerment. The Committee benefitted immensely from the efforts of the various State Government departments which submitted data on tribal development. hosted the Committee by arranging field visits and arranged meetings with local leaders and Government officials.

The HLC would like to acknowledge the National Law University, Dwarka, New Delhi, for providing logistical support at the initial stage. The I-ILC is obliged to the experts — Dr. K.B. Saxena, Shri C.R. Bijoy, Shri Suhas Chakma, and Shri Tushar Dash — who participated in the workshop •organised in April, for contributing to the

# introduction
The tribal population in India. though a numerically small minority, represents an enormous diversity or groups. They vary among themselves in respect or language and linguistic traits. ecological settings in which they live. physical features. size of thc population. the extent or acculturation, dominant modes or making a livelihood, level of development and social stratification. They are also spread over the length and breadth or the country though their geographical distribution is far from uniform. A majority of the Scheduled Tribe population is concentrated in the eastern. central and western belt covering the nine States of Odisha. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra. Gujarat, Rajasthan. Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. About 12 per cent inhabit the Northeastern region. about five per cent in the Southern region and about three per cent in the Northern States.

Groups and communities identified and enumerated as tribes during British rule came to be re-classified as Scheduled Tribes after the Constitution was adopted in 1950. The Constitution, as per Article 342. provided for the listing or these groups in the Schedule so that certain administrative and political concessions could be extended to them. Thus, a distinction was drawn in the form or tribe as a social and cultural entity and tribe as a politico-administrative category. However, there were groups and communities who belonged linguistically. socially and culturally to the same community but found themselves listed in some States of the Indian Union but not in other, often neighbouring. Slates. Similarly within the State. the same community may have found itselflisted in some regions but not in others.

There has also been the exclusion or certain groups from the Schedule due to differential spellings in the names of the communities. Such anomalies were wide spread at the time of adoption or the Constitution. although some corrective measures have been -taken from time to time. This partially explains why there has been a phenomenal increase in the number or communities in the Scheduled Tribe category as well as some increase in the total size orthe tribal population. Even today. there are demands being made by groups in dilTerent parts or the country lör inclusion in the category on various grounds. Thus. •tribe- continues to be an itnportant marker or identity and mode of political articulation among several communities in India.

The High Level Committee (I-ILC) was constituted by the Prime Minister's office in August. 2014 to look into the socio-economic, educational and health status or the tribals of India. The Terms or Reference (TOR) of the I-ILC refers to 'tribal communities' which expands the scope of this report beyond the political- administrative category or Scheduled Tribes. As mentioned earlier, the category of 'tribe' entails a social and cultural dimension but the Scheduled Tribe category has politico-administrative implications. The demand ror Scheduled Tribe status continues to this day and there i' no guarantee that such demands will not emerge in the future. 

### pg 25
the Constitution did not deline the criteria for recognition or Scheduled Tribes and
hence the Lokur Committee was set up to look into this issue. The Committee
recommended five criteria for identification, namely, (l) primitive traits (2) distinct
culture, (3) geographical isolation. (4) shyness of contact with the community at large
and (5) backwardness. However. some or these criteria carry forward certain
paternalistic and pejorative connotations from the colonial era. Features associated
with the idea of •indigenous peoples• may serve as a useful pointer in this regard.
although the term •indigenous' is more accurate in the context or North and South
America and Australia. In South Asia, this term has been questioned since it assumes
a theory of Aryan invasion. However. many tribal communities employ the term
•adivasi• (original inhabitant) as a political term or self-reference — although this term
is not recognised by the Government of India. While tribes have a distinct culture and
history, they also share commonalities with other marginalised sections or Indian
society, such as the lack or adequate political representation. economic deprivation
and cultural discrimination. Beyond their marginality. however, the many positive
features of tribal society must be appreciated and it must be recognised that non-tribal
people have much to learn from the richness of tribal cultures and systems or
knowledge.

The tribal population. scattered across the country. is differently placed with respect
to the politico-administrative structures existing in the country. Where they are a
numerical minority. they are a part or the general administrative structure or the
country. although certain rights have accrued to Scheduled Tribes across the country
through reservations in educational institutions and government employment.
However. where they are numerically dominant. two distinct administrative
arrangements have been provided for them in the Constitution in the form of the Fifth
and Sixth Schedules. The Sixth Schedule areas are some of the areas which were
•excluded • until the Government of India Act. 1935 in the erstwhile Assam and other
tribal-dominant areas which became separate States. These areas have been given
special provisions under Parl XXI or the Constitution. The extension or such
provisions to newer areas has been the result of political mobilization and social
movements. Similarly. there are States where the provisions orthe Fifth Schedule are
in force, The Fifth Schedule is aimed at providing protections to the tribal population
through separate laws for Scheduled Areas. including a special role ror the Governor
and the institution or Tribes Advisory Council. The provisions of the Fifth .Schedule
have seen I-unher legal and administrative reinforcement in the form of Provisions of
Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act. 1996.

Despite these special provisions. tribes are among the poorest and most marginalized sections of Indian society. Although numerically only about 8.6 per cent. they disproportionately represent the people living below the poverty line, are illiterate and suffer from extremely poor physical health. To illustrate, 45.7 per cent or the population as a whole was below the poverty line-in 1993-94. In the same year, 63.7

### pg 26
per cent or tribal people were living below the poverty line. almost 20 per cent than
the rest of the country. The poverty figures were 37.7 and 60.0 per cent respectively in
the year 2004-05. the scenario has been similar in the sphere or education and health.
The literacy rate or tribes in 2001 was 47 per cent as compared to 69 per cent ror the
general population. Moreover. as per the National Family Health Survey. 2005-06.
thc Infant Mortality rate was 62.1 per 1000 live births among tribes. and Under-five
Mortality was as high as 95.7 per 1000 live births.

In acknowledgement or the marginality or tribal communities. a number or
Committees and Commissions have been constituted over the years by the
government to look into the issues racing tribal communities, apart from numerous
other bodies which have examined the status or tribes as part of broader thematic
investigations. One of the first committees set up in this regard post-1947 was the
Elwin Committee which was to examine the functioning or Multi-Purpose
Development Blocks, the basic administrative unit for all tribal development
programmes. This was followed by the U.N. Dhebar Commission. constituted in 1960
to address the overall situation or tribal groups. including the issue of land alienation
in tribal areas. The I-okur committee. set up in 1965. looked at matters relating to the
scheduling or groups as Scheduled Tribes. It was this committee which delineated the
criteria for scheduling. which continues to operate to this day. The Shilu Ao
committee, 1966. like the Elwin committee. addressed the issue or tribal development
and welfare. ^7742b4

The 1970s. too. saw the constitution or several committees to address tribal problems
and it was on the basis or the recommendations or some or these committees that the
Tribal Sub-Plan approach of the government emerged. The committees constituted in
the more recent years have been the Bhuria Committee (1991) and the Bhuria
Commission (2002-2004). The Bhuria Committee recommendations paved the way
ror thc enactment or the PESA Act. 1996. while the Bhuria Commission focused on a
wide range or issues from the Fifth Schedule to tribal land and forests. health and
education. the working of Panchayats and thc status of tribal women. The most recent
committees have been the Bandopadhyay Committee. which looked at development
and governance in Left-Wing Extremist areas. and the Mungekar Committee. which
examined issues or administration and governance.

The issues that the above mentioned Committees have dealt with fall broadly into two categories: development and protection. And yet. on both these issues. the outcome for tribal communities has been mixed. Through the last six decades. the State has emphasized development while doing little to enhance the protections provided in the Constitution through the everyday practice of statecraft. Rather, the protective measures have been violated by the very State which is supposed to ensure the enforcement of these protections. It is this which largely explains the marginal Status or tribal communitier,.

### pg 27
The constitution of this High Level Committee by the Prime Ministcr•s Ollice marks
the recognition or the ract that Scheduled Tribes have lagged behind Other segments
orthe population in respect or overall economic standing. education and health status.
despite the country having witnessed a relatively high growth rate in last two decades.
How-ever. this growth seems to have bypassed the tribes as tribes seem to have not
done well with tx•spect to all indicators of development at the national level. The
Terms or Reference centres on the socio-economic. education and health status
tribal communities (Annexure l). However. issues of law and administration have
been included in our repoll. particularly since socio-economic slatuS is intimately
connected to legal frameworks and political arrangetnents.
In the course of preparing our repoll. the Committee went through several constraints
which must be mentioned at the outset. The most important limitation was that or
time. particularly since our visits to the States and interactions with the State
Government omcials were halted with the announcement or the Parliamentary
elections and the enforcement of the model code or conduct. Fullher. while the
Committee had requested the State Governnlents data on various parameters
related to Scheduled Tribes in their States. a large nunlber railed to submit this data.
Further. the National Sample Survey Olynisation (NSSO). Census or India. and the
National Family Health Survey did not have data on some issues to be examined by
the Committee as per the Terms of Reference. and where data existed. in Some cases.
disaggregated data was not available.
The Committee is mandated to prepare a position paper on the present socio-
economic. health and educational Status or STS- and is expected to suggest policy
initiatives as "ell as effective Outcome-oriented measures to improve development
indices and strengthen public service delivery to the Scheduled Tribes. The TOR
emphasizes an examination of the position of tribes vis—a-vis other social groups as
well as at different levels such as the national. regional and district levels. The key
issues and questions to be addressed are:

• geographical pattern of economic activity and the changes in avenues or
employment and livelihood due to rapid urbanization and shrinking or
their habitat; asset base and income levels and changes in the pattern or
ownership and productivity or immovable assets coupled with the role of
public policy and legal frameworks in racilitating/inhibiting such changes
• access to educational services. level social infntstructure. level of literacy and dropout rates
• access to health services. level or social infrastructure, Maternal Mortality Rate and Infant Mortality Rate
• relative shme of public. and private employment, reasons for under- representation and capacity building steps to enhance employability

adequate systems and structures ror implementation or protective
legislations
• Consolidate. collate and analyse this information to identiry areas or
intervention in order to address the socio-economic. health and education status or tribes.

Whereas data are the löundation or this study, careful analysis and interpretation of
data have been the most important and critical task of the Committee. It is on this
basis that the Committee has tried to discern the effectiveness and limitations of
relevant laws, policies. institutions and programmes and has made recommendations
ror addressing the tribal problem in India.

The Committee has prepared the report based on information obtained from various
Ministries. Departments and Agencies of the Central and State Governments. Two
major sources or information have been the omce 01" the Registrar General of India
and the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO). The Committee has surveyed
the published books. research articles and reports on social. economic. health and
educational status or Scheduled Tribes in India at different levels and on the working
of Constitutional and legal provisions. The HLC as a team visited some Fifth, Sixth
Schedule and non-Scheduled states and interacted with omcials. Non-Governmental
Organisations (NGOs) and community leaders to understand the problems existing in
the States. Alongside. individual members undertook field visits and attended public
hearings in several States to assess the ground-level reality. A large number or
representations from individuals. NGOs and comnwnity organisations were submitted
to the HLC. which have been examined and used in the report.

The report has been organized around five critical thematic issues: livelihood and
employment. education. health. involuntary displacement and migration. and legal
and constitutional matters. of the five themes. three themes are concerned with issues
that have been at the root of the post-colonial State's development agenda Ibr tribes:
livelihood and employment. education and health. Substantial resources have been
allocated specifically lor tribes in all these spheres. and special programmes and
schemes have also been Ibrmulated to address problems on these fronts. beginning
from the first phase or India•s planned developnlent. The concern with these issues
still continues. The steady increase in resource allocation lor these purposes and
revamping of programmes and schemes has proceeded side by side. And yet the status
or tribes in these spheres continues to be one or the critical gaps in India•s road to
development. The report examines the position or tribes in these spheres in three
separate chapters. This also raises the question of institutions and systems for delivery

or public goods and services. which is the subject oc the last chapter.lAlth0ugh. tribes
constitute a distinct social category and have special Constitutional and legal
provisions, they have no! been outside or India •s larger economic and political
framework. And the working or these larger institutional frameworks especially. thc
economic. legal and administrative. has adversely affected the tribal communities in
India. As a pan of the nation-building process. tribal areas have witnessed the large-
scale development or industry. mining. infrastructure projects such as roads and
railways. hydraulic prqiects such as dams and irrigation. These have been followed by
processes or urbanization as well. The overall impact of these on tribes has been
onen loss or livelihood. massive displacement and involuntary migration. Issues
pertaining to these mentioned problems have been critically examined in the report.

Another important issue analysed by the Committee is the working of legislations that
have a bearing on tribal conununities. It is not possible to make a detailed study of all
or these laws and hence. only those that the Ill-C views as central to their socio-
economic status have been addressed in the report. The Provisions or Panchayats
(Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (P ESA). 1996 and The Scheduled Tribes and
Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition or Forest Rights) Act (FRA). 2006.
enacted to redress the historical injustice to tribal and forest communities. have been
significant initiatives that have changed their legal status. However- policies and
practices have been slow to absorb the changed circumstances recognised in the law.
These legislations and their violations have been examined for lilture amendment.
Subjects such as land acquisition. Ibod security. detention and imprisonment. the
Status or Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and De-notilied Tribes. have
also been highlighted.

The above key substantive chapters in the report have been preliiced by two separate
chapters —outlining the geographical and demographic profile or tribal communities in
India and focusing on the "Orkings or the legal and administrative rramework
provided ror Scheduled Tribes in the Constitution.

As mentioned previously. the substantive issue of the socio-econolnic. educational
and health status of tribal communities are an integral part or the development agenda
that the State has been pursuing lor its citizens. With respect to tribal developnlent.
there were two prominent colonial discourses which have continued into the post-
colonial period.

In one or the discourses. lhe overall condition ortribal people. including their poverty.
is attributed to their social and geographical isolation. Conæspondingly. the whole
thrust orthe approach to tribal development in independent India was to be centred on

the integration of tribes into the larger Indian society. In fact. their integration was
seen as the solution to tribal •backwardness'. There was. however. also a dramatically
contrasting explanation Ibr their poverty. Thc main architect or this view was Verrier
Elwin who attributed their deplorable and impoverished condition to their contact
with the outside world. which had led to indebtedness and loss of control over their
land and rorests. The nationalist leadership recognized both of these dimensions and
addressed them. the pmvisions enshrined ror Scheduled Tribes in the Indian
Constitution ate u testimony to this dual approach. It provides for development as well
as for safeguarding and protection or their interests.
Ilowever. it was development (of a particular kind) that became the primary thrust of
the State's agenda, with minimal regard ror protections and safeguards. What the
State is actually pursuing in tribal areas — apart from Northeast India — is assimilation
rather than integration. contrary to what is claimed. A policy of integration would
pmvide space lor protections and safeguards ror their distinct identity. as enshrined in
the Constitution. However. these provisions are precisely what are under threat of
erosion through the process of cultural domination and more importantly. the
prevailing development paradigm.
Moreover. the view that lack of development of the tribal population was caused by
their isolation took precedence. This is often followed with the argument of
inadequate resource allocation for tribal development. However. even with an
increase in resource allocations since the Firth Five Year Plan beginning in 1974. the
condition or tribals has failed to improve proportionally. There is no doubt that
isolation is an important constraint to development. However. to put the blame
squarely on isolation is a gross distortion of the development problem of the tribal
population.

poor implementation or programmes is olléred as another explanation for the issue of
lack or social development among tribals. In this view. the solution lies in effective
implementation or State-sponsored development programmes and schemes. whether
these pertain to livelihood and income-generation activities. education. health. or
conununieation facilities. Ilowever. the problem or implementation in
tribal areas remains inadequately addressed.

the third set or arguments regarding poor development of the tribal populations is
built around the issue or the traditional socio-cultural aspects or tribal lilé. 11' tribals
suffer from low income. poor educational and health status and various kinds or
diseases. this is because or their traditions and lifestyle. However. this may not be due
as much to their social structure but to overall cultural and value framework or State-
led development. The framework of development is alien to the tribes. For example,
education in the regional language is usually familiar to the general population,
including the Scheduled Castes, but this is not the case in the tribal context (although
Scheduled Castes suffer from several Other forms of discrimination). Hence, social

### pg 31
development processes may not operate as smoothly as in •Illainstream• society. Thus.
there is a need to re-orienl development in tune with the tribal culture and to adopt a
morc humane approach to tribal development.
However. one can probe the issue or tribal development beyond concerns or
inadequate resource allocation. ineffective implementation or tribal traditions to
engage with the larger question of national and regional development. The
appropriation or tribal land and forests began during colonial rule and has continued
to the present. Since tribal-inhabited regions are rich in mineral. forest and water
resources. large-scale development projects invariably came to be located in tribal
areas.
No region in India illustrates this better than the States of Jharkhand and Odisha.
which have considerable natural resources. but also the highest percentages or tribal
people living below the poverty line. In 2004—05. the proportion of tribal people
living below poverty line stood at 34.2 per cent in Jharkhand while the percentage
was as high as 75.6 per cent in Odisha in the same year. Overcoming tribal isolation'
through large-scale mining. industrial and infrastructure prqiects. as these States have
witnessed. has clearly not resolved the problem or poor development indicators.
Rather. these have led to further impoverishment and vulnerability.

Over the last two decades. there has been a massive push to this development agenda.
which has coincided with economic liberalisation and the entry of private
corporations into tribal areas. This has been met with considerable resistance by tribal
communities. This is often interpreted as evidence that tribes are •anti-development•.
which is rar from the truth. What tribes have been questioning is the model or
development that is being imposed on them. Laws and rules that provide protection
to tribes are being routinely manipulated and subvefled to accommodate corporate
interests. Tribal protests are being met with violence by the State's paramilitary 'Orces
and the private security staff or corporations involved.
These dismal situations have paved the way ror Left-Wing Extremism (L WE) in tribal

madly. there are three perspectives through which LWE in the region is viewed. The
first view Sees it primarily as a national security problem to be addressed militarily.
This approach will result in the further alienation of tribal communities. widen the
trust deficit betueen the State and the people. and strengthen the Maoists. •the country
cannot afford to adopt this line or thinking. The second perspective notes Ihe overlap
between Maoist strongholds and tribal areas with dismal development indices and
views more development as the only solution. 'the third. a combination or lhe above
two. combines a military approach to secure the area with a rocus on establishment or
better public infrastructure.
However. there should be a fourth perspective based on the explicit recognition that
there has been subversion of the law by both government and corporations in order to
appropriate tribal resources. and that this situation needs to be rectified. It
acknowledges that State railures and the trust deficit have racilitnted the entry or the
Maois!s into these areas and helped them gain some support among the people.
particularly Dalits and adivasis. A large section or people in tribal heartlands have lost
faith in the ability orthe law and the willingness of the administration to protect their
interests. Any solution. therefore, should begin with confidence-building measures
through the redress of past wrongs and the guarantee or justice. This is necessary in
order to restore lhe trust orthe tribals in the government.

To summarize. tribal communities race disregard for their values and culture. breach
of protecti•.e legislations. serious material and social deprivation. and aggressive
resource alienation. Ilence. the solution to lhese issues should enable the tribals to
protect their own interests. Below. we outline the perspective Illat lönns the

# 3. Geographical and Demographic Profile
## 3.1 Introduction
Although the Census or 1 enumerates the total population or Scheduled Tribes at
10.42.81.034 persons. constituting 8.6 per cent of the population of the country. the
tribal conununities in India are enormously diverse and heterogeneous. There are
wide ranging diversities among them in respect or languages spoken. size of
population and mode of livelihood. The number of communities that find their place
in the list or the Schedule of the Indian constitution is reflective of this diversity. The
Government or India. in its Draft National Tribal Policy, 2006 records 698 Scheduled
Tribes in India. As per the Census or India 201 1, the number or individual groups
notified as Scheduled Tribes is 705. While it is not possible to pmvide detailed
descriptions of the demographic features and socio-economic Status 01" each or these
Iribal groups. this section attempts to map out the broad contours or the Scheduled
Tribes of the country in terms oflheir demography and geography.

There are various ways in which the demography or Scheduled Tribes may be
understood. Here. we have primarily presented data on tribal population and its
geographical distribution across states and the different individual tribes. areas or
concentration and populations. Further. we include available quant native and
qualitative data on the tribal population in relation to languages and livelihoods.
density of forest cover and existence of mineral resources. and on-going con nicts.

The territories inhabited by tribes cross States and Union Territories in the country
and several tribes are round residing across -five to six states. There are also tribal
groups whose populations are distributed across international boundaries such as
tribes in Himachal Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh. West Bengal. Arunachal Pradesh. Sikkim.
Nagaland. Manipur, Meghalaya and Mizoram which have fellow tribes people in
China (including Tibet). Bhutan. Myanmar and Bangladesh. The Nagas. ror instance.
are divided among the stales or Nagaland. Manipur. Assam. and Arunachal Pradesh as
well as in the neighbouring country of Myanmar.

The tribes can be distinguished into five broad regional groupings based on
ecological. social. economic. administrative. and ethnic factors (although there are
many overlaps):

1. Himalayan Region: It has three sub-regions: (a) Nonheastern Himalayan region.
(b) Central Himalayan region, and (c) North Western Himalayan region.


### pg 35
2.  middle region is constituted by the states of bihar, jharkhand, west bengal, odissa, madhya pradesh (including Chattishgarh), where more than 55% tribal people of india live.
3. wester region - It includes the States of Rajasthan. Gujarat, Maharashtra. Goa. 3, Jl'estern Region: Dadra and Nagar llaveli.
4. Southern region: It is comprised of the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu. Karnataka and Kerala.
5. Island Region: The Islands or Andaman and Nicobar in the Bay of Bengal and Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.

there are many dilTerences between these regions as well as differences from tribe to
tribe. For example, while the Northeast is often viewed as a singular and
homogeneous entity. the region is highly diverse with over 200 tribes and sub-tribes.
each or which have their own language, culture and political structures. Further, the
tribes or the Northeast differ from tribes in other parts of India, particularly in terms
of their historical Rlationship with the colonial and Indian State. The tribes of the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands. comprising 556 islands or which only a rew are
populated. are also distinct. The Islands are administered as a Union Territory under
the Central Government and are home to some or the snlallest tribes such as the Great
Andamanese. Onge. Jarawa and the Sentinelese.

The tribes can also be dilTerentiated on the basis of population size since communities
like Gonds. Bhils. Santhals. Oraons. Minas, Mundas and so on have a population that
ranges from one million to a little over seven million people. As against this. there are
conununities like the Andamanese Islanders and tribal groups such as the Birjia and
Asur in Bihar and the Birhor of Madhya Pradesh who have a population of less than
200 persons.

The languages India lhll into four difli-•rent linguistic lhmilies. These are Indo-
European. Dravidian. Austro-Asiatic and the Tibeto-Burman sub-liunily or the Sino-
Tibetan languages. Approximately three-rourths of the country speaks languages
belonging to Indo-European family. l•lowever, only a little over one per cent or tribal
population speak languages of this family. the Bhil and I-lalbi tribes being the two
main groups alnong them. Languages belonging to Dravidian family are spoken by
tribes such as the Gond, Khond, Koya. Oraon, and Toda. Tibeto-Burman languages
are spoken by the tribes of the Himalayas and Nonheast India. The Austro-Asiatic
family or languages is spoken only by tribals in the country like the Santhal, Munda,
and ho.

### pg 36
Scheduled Tribes communities live in about or the country's area, in various
ecological and geo-climatic conditions ranging from plains and forests to hills. A
large proportion or Scheduled Tribes are collectors or forest produce, hunter-
gatherers. shifting cultivators. pastoralists and nomadic herders. and artisans.
Traditional occupations or tribal groups may range from honey-collection to hunting
small animals to engaging in metal-work and mpe-making.

A majority or tribal groups work in the primary sector. and are heavily dependent on
agriculture either as cultivators or as agricultural labourers. At the same time, a
number of Scheduled Tribes no longer follow their traditional occupations and work
as labourers on plantations or in mines and factories (in many cases, since the
nineteenth-century). Displacement and enforced migration has also led to an
incleasing number or Scheduled Tribes working as contract labourers in the
construction industry and as domestic workers in major cities. Over 80% or
Scheduled Tribes work in the primary sector against 53% or the general population,
primarily as cultivators. However, the number or STS who were cultivators. declined
from over 68% to 45% in 2001 whereas the number or tribal agricultural labourers
increased from about 20% to 37%. demonstrating increasing landlessness among
tribals. This trend has intensified. as can be seen in data from the 201 1 Census. It is
further estimated that. in the last decade. about 3.5 million tribal people are leaving
agriculture and agriculture-related activities to enter the informal labour market.

Scheduled Tribes comprise 1 1.3 per cent of the Indian rural population and 2.8 per
cent of the Indian urban population. In 2001. the proportion or STS to the total
population was 8.2 per cent. while the proportion was 10.4 per cent in rural areas and
2.4 per cent in urban areas. The total male ST population according to the 201 1
census is 5,24.09.823 or which 4.71.26.341 are residing in rural areas and 52.83.482
are in urban areas. The total female ST population is 5.18.71.21 1 with 4.66.92.821 in
rural areas and 51.78.390 in urban areas. The sex ratio among the Scheduled Tribes is
991 females to every 1000 males in rural areas and 980 Iémales to every 1000 males
in urban areas. the average being 990.

## 3.2 Population of Scheduled Tribes across States
The löllowing table segregates data on proportion or STS in the population of each
State thus depicting the States with the largest proportion or Scheduled Tribes (though
not the largest in tertns or actual population) as well as the States with the lowest
proportion of STS (not including states/Union Territories with no recognised ST
population).

The Himalayan Region comprises 2.03 per cent of STS in the States of Jammu and
Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh; the Northeastern region
has 12.41 per cent of STS in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur,

### pg 37
Mizoram. Tripura. Meghalaya and Assam; the Central-east Indian region has the
largest proportion or STs, about 52.51 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand.
Pradesh. Chhattisgarh. Odisha and West Bengal; the Western region of
Rajasthan. Gujarat. Daman and Diu. Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Maharashtra and Goa
has 27.64 per cent or STs; the Southern region has 5.31 per cent or STs in the states of
Karnataka. Kerala and Tamil Nadu; and linally. 0.1 1 per cent of STS live in the island
region of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep.

Among the States and Union Territories. Lakshadweep ranks top with the highest proportion of ST population (within the state) of 94.8%. followed by Mizoram (94.4%). Nagaland (86.5%), Meghalaya (86.1%), and Arunachal Pradesh (68.8%). Uttar Pradesh stands last with the lowest proportion or ST population of 0.56%. followed by Tamil Nadu (1.1%). Bihar (1.28%), Kerala (1.45%). and Uttarakhand (2.89%).

The map below pictorially depicts these figures to indicate the States more than 40 per
cent tribal population. with between twenty and rorty per cent. bet"'een ten and
twenty per cent. five and ten per cent. and below five per cent. The States of the
Northeast are clearly the states with a very large tribal population relative to the total
population while significant tribal populations are also residing in the Central states of
Madhya Pradesh. Chhattisgarh. Jharkhand and Odisha. 'l he lowest proportion of
tribals in the State population is found in the Southern states or Kerala and Tamil
Nadu and the Northern states or Uttarakhand. Uttar Pradesh. New Delhi and Bihar.

Regarding the distribution of ST population by States, Madhya Pradesh stands first
with 14.7%. f0110"Cd by Maharashtra (10.1%). Odisha (9.2%). Rajasthan (8.9%).
Gujarat (8.6%). Jharkhand (8.3%). Chhattisgarh (7.5%). Andhra Pradesh (5.7%).
West Bengal (5.1%). Karnataka (4.1%). Assam (3.7%). Meghalaya (2.5%). and the
remaining States represent 1 1.6% or the tribal population. Proportion 0t- ST
population in the rural areas is 1 and in urban areas is 2.80/6. More than half the
Scheduled Tribe population is concentrated in the States or Madhya Pradesh.
Chhattisgarh. Maharashtra. Odisha, Jharkhand and Glliarat.

The table below shows us the distribution orthe ST population in the various States or
India. with Madhya Pradesh having the largest percentage share Ot-the ST population.
Other States with a significant proportion or the all-Indian ST population are
Maharashtra, Odisha. Rajasthan, Gujarat and Jharkhand — all having between 8 and 10
per cent share. Interestingly, Kamataka and West Bengal. neither or which have any
Scheduled Areas within its State boundaries have 4.1 per cent and 5.1 per cent orthe
country's ST population. The •others' of the ST population — 11.6 per cent — are

While the tables above indicate the distribution or the ST population according to the
most recent census. it is valuable to examine the decadal growth (or decline) rate or
the ST populations in each or these States as well as the changing proportion or STS
within the total population of the State. While these figures do not transparently yield
anv definitive trends. they do point toward issues or migration or ST population
outside the State- increasing influx or non-tribals into the State. recognition or more
tribal groups by the State and so on.

The decadal gromh of Scheduled Tribes is better than the growth rate of the general
population between 1991 and 2001. and 2001 and 201 1. Between 1991 and 2001.
while the decadal growlh rate or the general population was recorded at 22.66. the
Scheduled Tribe growth rate was 24.45. Similarly. between 2001 and 201 1, when the
general population growth ratc was 17.64. the growth ratc or Scheduled Tribe
population in the corresponding period was 23.66. On the whole, the ST population
within the total population of India has increased from 8.2 per cent in 2001 to 8.6 per

### pg 41
cent in 2011. In many States, tile STS as a proportion orthe population have remained
fairly constant between the 2001 and 2011 censuses. However. States/Union
Territories such as Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Chhattisgarh. Daman and Diu and
Nagaland have recorded small decreases in the relative proportion of STS in the
population between 2001 and 201 1 (up to about three per cent decrease in Nagaland).
The most significant decrease in proportion is in Dadra and Nagar Haveli. which has
recorded a decrease or about ten per cent over the decade. Other states have recorded
small increases which may be due to population growth as well as State recognition of
gleater number of tribes. Significant increases in proportion can be noted in Sikkim
(about 13 per cent) and Arunachal Pradesh (about four per cent).

![[Pasted image 20220110084130.png]]

### pg 42
![[Pasted image 20220110084149.png]]

From the following figure. it is evident that the population or Scheduled Tribes is
increasing from 30 million in the year 1961 to over a 100 million in the year 201 1.
This is reflected in increasing ST population in both rural and urban areas.

![[Pasted image 20220110084213.png]]

The following table disaggregates the data by presenting the proportion or STS in the
rural and the urban population 01- each State. Further. the table shows the changing
proportions in the rural and urban populations between 2001 and 201 1. pointing to
processes or migration of tribals to urban areas as well as increasing urbanisation of
hitherto rural tribal areas. Several States display an increase in the proportion or STS
in rural areas (which could be due to population growth among STs, migration or non-
tribals from rural to urban areas and so on). Almost across the board, however, there
appears to be an increase of STS in urban areas which is indicative of population

growth and increased migration or STS to urban areas (in search or employment
opportunities. possibly as a result of loss or livelihood in rural areas).

### 3.3 Number of Scheduled Tribes
Having gained a picture orthe total tribal populations in each State or the country, the
table below indicates the total number of tribal communities in the different States. As
can be seen from the table, among the States, Odisha has the largest number of
notified STS (62) followed by Karnataka (50), Maharashtra (45), Madhya Pradesh
(43) and Chhattisgarh (42). Sikkim has the least with four tribes followed by

### pg 44
Nagaland. Daman and Diu and Uttarakhand with five each. Among the South Indian
States (without any Scheduled Areas). Karnataka has the largest number or Scheduled
Tribes (50) rollowed by Tamil Nndu (36) and Kerala (36).

![[Pasted image 20220110084427.png]]

## 3.4 District-level data on Scheduled Tribe population
There are 90 districts in India. where the tribal population is more than 50% or the
total population (See Annexure 2 ror names of all 90 districts). Similarly. in 62
districts. the tribal population is more than 25%. but less than 50% of the total
population (See Annexure 2 ror names or all 62 districts). The following tables
demonstrate the State-wise number or districts with more than 50 per cent ST
population and with between 25 and 50 per cent ST population. and state-wise total
nunlber of districts with Inore than 25 per cent ST population. While this gives a
broad picture or the areas of tribal concentrations within the various States. it should
be noted that these figures do not cover the entire ST population since there may be
less than 25 per cent Or less than 50 per cent ST population at the district level but
more than this proportion at the block or village-level (which may be listed as
Scheduled Areas as well).

### pg 46
The table below goes beyond data on tribal-majority districts in the country to
demonstrate the total spread of Scheduled Tribes across India. While the preceding
tables focused on districts with substantial tribal populations (at least more than 25
per cent). the following table shows the total number or districts in which Scheduled
Tribes reside. even those districts in which they may constitute a minority (less than
One per cent). Thus. Scheduled Tribes reside in as many as 543 districts in India. It is
also pertinent to note that these figures indicate proportion or Scheduled Tribes in the
total district population which does not reveal much about the actual size of the
Scheduled Tribe population in the district. In large and populous districts, even one
per cent tribal population could indicate a large number or people.

![[Pasted image 20220110084711.png]]

## 3.5. Populous and 'Vulnerable' Tribes
Many of the large tribal groups have several sub-tribes and are called by various
(though usually similar) nomenclatures in different parts of the country since they are
often several over a large area often Crossing the administrative boundaries or States.
This situation has caused considerable confusion and anomalies in classification or
tribes due to misspelling of names or non-recognition or synonyms used to refer to
various tribes and sub-tribes. A significant number of the modifications in the list or
Scheduled Tribes seek to address these anomalies. although there are also some cases
or addition of a new tribe or sub-tribe to the list. The table below indicates the number
of modifications made in the list or Scheduled Tribes since the 2001 Census. The
figures are organised according to the States with reference to which the change "as
made (since the ST list is made State-wise and is not a pan-Indian catalogue). As can
be seen from the table below, the largest number or modifications is in relation to
addition ora synonym or sub-group within an existing entry (ofa tribe).

### pg 47

![[Pasted image 20220110084757.png]]

As per the 2001 census. the tribe with the largest population is the Bhil (12689952)
Ibliowed by the Gond 10859422). the Santal (5838016) and the Mina (3800002). Most or
the large tribes have populations spread across several States and in some cases. over the
entire breadth or the country. Many or these tribes have been integrated into the larger
political economy for centuries and some of them have benefitted from State policies to a
relatively greater extent as compared to smaller tribal groups.

![[Pasted image 20220110084823.png]]

The table below provides a register or the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups
(PVTGs) with population of less than a 1000 persons. One of the criteria ror their
vulnerability is their small population— the population size of the smallest group
reaches a low of only 17 persons in the case or the Birjia in the state or Bihar.

### pg 49
## 3.6 Forests, Dams and Mines
According to the Forest Survey of India,2 201 1, the total forest cover in the country is
692, 027 sq. km. which comprises 21.05 per cent or the total geographical area or the
country. The total forest cover in the 188 tribal districts in 26 states and Union
Territories in the country identified as falling under the Integrated Tribal
Development Programme (ITDP) is about 411. 881 sq. km, which constitutes 37.25
per cent or the geographical area in these districts. Therefore. almost 60 per cent or
the Ibrest cover or the country is round in tribal areas. The States with the largest
forest cover in terms or absolute area are also States with substantial tribal
populations— Madhya Pradesh (77.700 sq. km). Arunachal Pradesh (67, 410 sq. km.).
Chhattisgarh (55. 674 sq. km). Maharashtra (50, 646 sq. km) and Odisha (48. 903 sq.
km.). In terms or proportion or forest cover in relation to the geographical area of the
State. the Island regions and the Northeastern states are highest —
led by Mizoram (90.6 per cent). rollowed by Lakshadweep (84.56 per cent), Andaman and Nicobar
Islands (81.51 per cent. Arunachal Pradesh (80.50 per cent), Nagaland with (80.33 per
cent). Meghalaya (77.02 per cent) and Tripura (76.07 per cent).

of the 58 districts, wherein the forest cover is greater than 67 per cent. 51 districts are
tribal districts? Therefore. a large section or the tribal population have been
dependent on the forest for their livelihood. However. much of this forest was
classified as Reserved Forests and Protected Forests as well as Wildlife Santuaries
and National Parks. resulting in the marginalisation or tribal communities who were
treated as encroachers on this land prior to the passing of the Forest Rights Act. 2006.

With regard to mineral resources. three States with substantial tribal populations —
Odisha. Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand - have considerable mineral reserves. These three
States alone account 70 per cent of India's coal reserves. 80 per cent of its high-
grade iron ore. 60 per cent or its bauxite and almost 100 per cent or its chromite
reserves' Indeed. according to the Centre for Science and Environment. about half of
the top mineral-producing districts are tribal districts — and these are also districts
with lörest cover or 28 per cent which is larger than the national average or 20.9 per
cent. Unfortunately. much of this forest land has been diverted ror mining purposes
resulting in environmental degradation. loss of livelihood. and displacement or tribal
communities. Many or these mineral-bearing areas are also by the on-going
Conflict between the Maoists and the State .

Dams have been another source or displacement ror tribes since Independence. with
India being one or the largest dam-building nations in the world. It is estimated that
dams are the biggest causes of displacement in the country, although actual figures
regarding the number of people displaced range from 20 to 50 million. However, it is
generally agreed that about 40 per cent of those displaced belong to the Scheduled

Tribes. Given that the Scheduled Tribes constitute about eight per cent or the
country's population. they are clearly disproportionately represented in the number of
displaced persons.

## 3.7 Conflicts affecting tribal populations
Numerous armed conflicts affect large parts or tribal areas in contemporary India
spanning the central region to the Northeast. In central India. the Inost well-known
conflict at present is the armed conflict between the Communist Party of India
(Maoist) and the Indian state, which is ongoing in parts or the states or Maharashtra,
Andhra Pradesh. Madhya Pradesh. Chhattisgarh. Jharkhand. Bihar, Odisha and West
Bengal. among others. A large portion or these areas are tribal-dominated and it is
tribal civilians, who have been worst affected by the conflict. The conflict has only
escalated in recent years, particularly in central India, following the initiation by the
state of a counter-insurgency operation known as the Salwa Judum in Chhattisgarh
which has been responsible for rapes, murders. arson, looting and intimidation in the
name of defeating the Maoists.

Violent conflicts plague large parts of the Northeast and this has been so since 1947.
Across the region, there are conflicts between the State and tribal groups, between different tribes, and between tribes and non-tribal groups — although the State is involved in all or these conflicts in some way or another. As a result. there is an
alarming concentration of troops. border security forces and police personnel in this
region. Further. the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. 1958 is in operation in the
states or Manipur. Assam and Nagaland as well as parts or Tripura and Arunachal
Pradesh. This Act-gives considerable powers to the armed forces to arrest and search
without warrant as well as shoot to kill on mere suspicion. once an area has been
declared as •disturbed-. The Act also provides that no legal proceedings can be
initiated against military personnel without permission from the Central Government.
Many cases of extra-judicial killings. rapes and harassment by armed lörces have
been reported in these States amidst a culture of impunity. Apart from protracted
armed struggles with the State as well as inter-ethnic conflicts, there are also more
localised peaceful instances or struggles of tribals against the State and corporations
over land and natural resources, occuring across the country.

To conclude, the above sections have provided a brier profile or the Scheduled Tribes
or the country in an attempt to provide an outline or the communities at the centre of
this report. Such a broad sketch certainly tails to adequately capture the full richness.
diversity and complexity or tribal life and the struggles orthe tribal people. However.
it serves as a short introduction to the chapters that follow and which constitute a
detailed exposition of each of these issues — from the scheduling of tribes to the plight
of the Parlicularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), the changing livelihoods or the
tribals to their rights over forest resources and their displacement for the construction
of mines and dams.

# 4. Tribes: Legal and Administrative Framework
### Section I: Definition and concept of tribe
## 4.1 Definitions of 'tribe'
The Indian Constitution, and laws made under it. recognise lhe special status of tribal
communities. While sociologists and social anthropologists have debated the defining
characteristics of a tribe, the Constitution recognises that tribal communities need and
deserve special protections and that the politico-administrative establishment must act
to ensure that such protections are extended to tribal communities. Accordingly. the
device or scheduling has been adopted to enable identification of tribal communities
and tribal areas that are to come within this dispensation.

It is necessary to examine the early origins or the concept or •tribe• and its
transromation in various historical and political contexts. specifically during the
colonial period in the Indian sub-continent. In the Roman context, the ternl 'tribe• was
used to refer to a state of barbarism, but also to indicate a tributary relationship
between a group and the imperial State. with whom gifts and tributes were exchanged.
Tribe. therefore, referred to a particular relationship between centre and periphery.
which was equally applicable to the tribal relationship with the Mughal Empire in
India. One or the other early meanings of tribe was also that of a group claiming
common ancestry. Later. the idea of the tribe as people living in •primitive' conditions
became dominant. The reference to a particular relationship with the State was pushed
to the background by an emphasis on the tribe as an autochthonous. homogeneous
whole — an independent, self-contained unit.

In India. the local equivalent of the term 'tribe' is often assumed to be •jana• or
•communities of people' based on the usage or the term in ancient Buddhist and
puranic texts. In this.conception. the termjana was used in opposition to the term jan
to indicate that these communities were outside the jan or hierarchical caste system or
social organisation. This view. however. was not universally accepted. since other
scholars point out that the categories or jana andjati do not neatly overlap with that or
tribe and caste respectively in the present context.

It was largely following the various tribal rebellions during the colonial period that
tribes calne to be seen as the region•s 'original inhabitants• who existed outside orthe
caste system and had been marginalised by the more advanced caste-Hindu society.
The nineteenth-century ethnographic view or tribes argued that the term reli-•rred to
both a particular type of society based on kinship ties and a stage of evolution? In the
former view, standard definitions describe the tribe as a social group with a definite
area. dialect, cultural homogeneity and unifying social organisation. An amalgam of
the various traits ascribed to tribal groups include: relative egalitarianism within the

### pg 52
group. the absence or complex political structures. Strong and functional kinship
bonds, cooperation, tetTitorial integrity. cultural and linguistic distinctiveness. and
lower levels of technology. In the case orthe latter view. tribes arc seen as 'primitive'
societies in the Sense or lacking all the traits or modern. Western society in that they
are non-literate, •uncivilised non-industrial. rural. and so on.

The two views are connected in that tribes were seen as having primitive Social
Organisation. implying that tribal people were at a lower Stage in thc evolutionary
social hierarchy in terms or their socio-cultural characteristics. economy and political
structures. often being described as simple as well as insulated from changes in the
larger regional polity. Tribes in the Indian context have also been defined as groups
remaining outside of the structures or State and civilisation.

Each definition of tribes stresses on a particular aspect or tribal life — their relationship
with the state. civilization and processes development as well as specific features or
their culture, livelihood. and economy. However, the dominant conception or tribe
that developed during this period revolved around notions or 'backwardness•,
indigeneity. and separation from the larger Hindu civilization. Tribes were identified
largely in terms of what they were not: they did not practice Vedic Hinduism, they
were not Muslim. their societies were marked by the relative absence or economic and
ritual stratification. and they were not integrated into the "modern" economy or
civilization.6

The Census of India has also played a critical role in shaping the modern
understanding of tribe through its ell-orts at enumeration and classification. The proper
delineation of tribes began with the colonial census in the late nineteenth century to
provide detailed information about the population or the sub-continent. Through this
exercise. certain communities were labelled as tribes although the criteria transformed
over time. In the 1881 census. the term used was •forest tribes, a sub-category within
the broader group or •agricultural and pastoral castes'. In the 1 901 census. tribes were
identified as those who •practiced animism' thus placing religious practices at the
centre. Therefore. those practising Hinduism were viewed as castes. while those
practising animism were labelled tribes. although this criterion would change in the
following decades such that. at present. Scheduled Tribes can practise any religion.
including Hinduism and Christianity. In later censuses. additional references to
territory Were included. producing the label or •hill and forest tribes • in 1921 and
•primitive tribes' a decade later. The new descriptions laid emphasis on the isolation
of tribes within hill and forest areas as well as their •primitive- way One orthe
earliest attempts to create a list or tribes in the sub-continent was during the 1931
census which identified 'primitive tribes'. This was followed by a list of "backward
tribes" for the provinces made under the Government of India Act, 1935. In the 1941

### pg 53
census. tribes were identified not in terms or their religion but according to their
'origin', that is. tribes were those who have a •tribal origin'

Subsequent ethnographers have contested these conceptualisations. arguing that tribes
have constantly been in interaction with other social groups. and that, terms such as
•primitive• and 'backward• are based on the problematic assumption of social
evolutionism. Other scholars have argued that the conception or tribe as isolated was
based on their emergent marginalisation through unjust forest policies. lörced
sedentarization and pacification during British colonial rule. Large segments of the
tribal population were integrated into the market economy during this period through
the appropriation or their lands as well as their labour in commercial forestry. mines
and plantations.

In the post-colonial period, therefore, certain anthropologists have tended to view the
'tribe' as a colonial construction, rendering fixed and rigid those identities which were
earlier relatively fluid and contextual. Anthropological accounts ortcibal communities
have largely provided working definitions of tribe which have often been specific to
their site of study given that tribes differ considerably in terms or their population
size. mode of livelihood and level of integration within the capitalist economy. There
is huge differentiation, ror example, in the range occupations practiced among
they may be: hunters and gatherers. shifting cultivators. settled
tribes agriculturalists. pastoralists. artisans, farm labourers. and plantation and industrial
workers.

recognised at the time was largely based on the list or "backward tribes" prepared by
the colonial administration in 1936. At the time or the first census or independent
India in 1951. there were 212 recognised Scheduled Tribes in the country. The term
Scheduled Tribe itself is a politico-administrative category that does not capture the
enormous social complexity of the various tribes encompassed within its fold. The
Constitution of India categorised certain sections of the population as Scheduled
Tribes to make available special welfare provisions to them — even though this
category "'as never properly defined. In a circular fashion. tribes are defined as those
groups enumerated as tribes under the Indian Constitution. Thus. Article 366(25) or
the Constitution defines Scheduled Tribes as follows:

"Scheduled Tribes means such trihes or tribal comnnmilies or purls Qfor groups u•ilhin such
tribes or Irihal communities as are deemed under article 342 10 be Scheduled Tribes Jor the
purposes oflhis Constitulion."

The list of tribes drawn up by the colonial and post-colonial government was based on political and administrative considerations, given that State recognition could be translated into important protective and developmental benefits. However, the identification or such groups has been based on recommendations made by the omcials of the 1931 Census, the First Backward Classes Commission 1955, and the

### pg 54
Report or the Advisory Committee on the Revision or thc Lists or Scheduled Castes and Tribes, 1965. The currently Ibllowed criteria identification arc: primitive traits, distinctive culture. geographical isolation. shyness or contact with the conununity at large. and general backwardness. As can be seen from several of these identit\'ing features. the idea or the tribe as the •primitive • has clearly continued into []()the post-colonial period. The first Backward Classes Commission (Kaka Kalelkar Commission) appointed by the President of India under Article 340 argued that the tribes:

"lead a separate exclusive exisfence and are not idly assimilated in the jnain body o/ • lhe people. Scheduled Tribes may belong to uny religion. They are listed as Scheduled Tribes, because oflhe kind led hy lhem. "

In 1951, the Tribal Welfare Committee comprising of anthropologists, social workers and administrators met under the Indian Conference or Social Work in Calcutta and recommended these criteria lör dilTerentiation or tribes: tribes are those who are still confined to their original forest habitats and rollow the old pattern or life; semi-tribal communities are those who have settled down in rural areas and practice agriculture and similar occupations: acculturated tribal communities are those who have migrated to urban and setni-urban areas and are working in industries and have modern cultural traits. and other tribal communities who have been totally assimilated into the Indian population. However. there are many forest-dwellers who are not tribals; settledk agriculture is practiced by many tribes (who are not semi-tribal in other respects) and migration to urban areas does not necessarily lead to the shedding or all tribal cultural traits.

In 1959. the Government or India appointed a Commission headed by Shri. U.N. Dhebar to look into the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes and even this commission railed to arrive at a satisfactory definition. The Commission concluded that Scheduled Tribes can be identified by the ract that they live apart in the hills. and even where they live on the plains. they lead a separate. excluded existence and are not fullyk assilnilated with the rest of society. As per its recommendations. it reiterates the position that the technical definition ora trihe is any group listed as a Scheduled Tribe under Article 342.

The granting or ST status to certain social groups is an on-going process. indicating that there are groups which might identify themselves as tribes but which remain outside or the official ST category. The First Backward Classes Commission set up by the President or India in 1953. recommended the declaration of additional communities as Scheduled. Thus. through another order in 1956, the President notified a modification of the list of Scheduled Tribes. In the 1961 census, the number of Scheduled Tribe communities increased to 427, which was twice the number from the previous census. This increased to 432 by the time orthe 1971 census.

### pg 55
As the issue of anomalies within the ST list constantly arose. the government set up the Advisory Committee on the Revision or the Lists or Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Lokur Committee Report) which was to advice on the proposals received by the government on revision or these lists in a "rational and scientific manner". The committee was specifically asked for its recommendations on whether communities listed as Scheduled Tribes in one area or a particular State or Union kTerritory (UT) should be recognised in other pans of the same State or UT as well as in other States.

A glance at the lists or tribes recommended ror both inclusion and exclusion by the Lokur Committee throws further light on their considerations while determining the legal status or groups claiming tribal identity. Some of the reasons cited for inclusion living in caves'. •living in of new tribes within the list include •very isolated', •still 'having tribal forest areas', or more vaguely, •are primitive jungle tribes•, characteristics', 'very backward tribe', and •distinctive dress and customs'. Clearly, a mixture of geographical and locational features as well as primitiveness and backwardness account for the suggested Constitutional recognition or a range of tribes. On the other hand, the explanations for suggested exclusion from the list were •not a tribe'. •do not possess tribal characteristics', 'population insignificant' and 'assimilated with the general population'

On the question or enumeration. the Lokur Committee noted that in light of several Supreme Court rulings on the matter. it would be necessary ror the government to list not simply the name of each tribe under the Schedule but to create a compendium of all local synonyms. phonetic variations and sub-tribes within each tribe in order tok ensure that confusions over inclusion are avoided. The committee held that. in light or this onerous task. it should henceforth be assumed that any caste or tribe specified in the list would automatically include all synonyms, variations and sub-groups. The Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Areas Conunission (Bhuria Conunission) Report (2002-2004) has pointed out that 'Ainds of change have been sweeping through tribal society and this has resulted in the growth or individualism. panicularly among the youth. However. despite transformations in the internal communitarian dynamics or tribal society which threaten to alter its very •tribal-ness• the Commission noted  that tribal identity is likely to reassert itself in the lörm or traditional norms and mores.

The Bhuria Commission Report Further stated that:

"as an individual, individualism may be practised by a tribal when he is at large and may be abroad, hut even in facing Ihe larger ll'orld his psyche looks bachrards to lean on the support of his own tribal community, thereby revealing lhe profundity of bonds with his tribe "

### pg 56
Beyond definitions of •tribes'. the Indian context has produced a situation in which classification or communities as Scheduled Tribes is not uniform throughout the country but varies based on often arbitrary administrative boundaries. Several committees have taken note or this anomalous situation, introduced through the Government or India Act, 1935. whereby members or the same tribe from an ethnological or social point of view are recognised as Scheduled Tribes in one State or one part or a State and not in others. That is. the category or Scheduled Tribes. although distinct. vv•as connected 10 an understanding or 'tribal areas • in that. until 1976, area restrictions were in operation with regard to recognition as a Scheduled Tribe. This meant that it was possible for X tribe to be recognised in district Y or a particular State but not in neighbouring district Z or the same State. Thus. ST status "as linked to place. although the place itself need not be a Scheduled Area.

According to the Lokur Committee, these territorial restrictions acted as a barrier to spatial and social mobility, since moving out or the area in which their tribe is recognised would imply the loss of all benefits and privileges. Such restrictions were therefore, seen to be contrary to the goal of tribal integration which advocates the end to tribal isolation • and the inter-mingling or populations. Despite recognition of the often bizarre consequences of area restrictions. the Lokur Committee refrained from recommending changes in the same since inter-state movement or tribes was deemed to be negligible at the time. Their report also dismissed the idea or an all-India Scheduled Tribes list. since the Constitution provides ror lists to be made only at the State or UT level. The Lokur Committee recommended that the various tribes in the list should be administratively differentiated. so as to ensure that priority in development planning should be given to the more deprived. among the groups.

In [[1976]]. the Removal or Area Restrictions (Amendment) Act was passed. which removed area restrictions on the recognition or Scheduled Tribes. making lists applicable to entire States rather than blocks and districts within States as was the case earlier. This led to a substantial increase in the tribal population as recorded in the census. Now. a tribe is included within the Scheduled Tribe list On a state-wide basis — although it is possible that the same tribe is not Scheduled Tribe in other states. I-lowever. it has been noted that the sharp increase in recorded tribal population between the 1971 and 1981 censuses was nol only due 10 the removal or urea restrictions but due to misreporting to census ollicials by groups with nomenclatures []()sounding similar to that or certain Scheduled Tribes. Between 1971 and 1981. the population or Scheduled Tribes. as recorded in the Census. rose by 95 per cent in Maharashtra and 690 per cent in Karnataka. This occurred despite the ract that reporting oneself as a Scheduled Tribe in the census does not in any Way support claims for Scheduled Tribe status under the Constitution.

Despite efforts made by' various governments, there continue to be several anomalies in 'he scheduling of tribes. The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has noted that cases involving inclusion of communities which are scheduled in one

### pg 57
state and non-scheduled in a neighbouring state need to be given priority in order that members are not denied benefits any further. The Banjaras. ror example, are a recognised Scheduled Tribe settling in various parts of the country, including now in Delhi. However. the strong association between the idea ora tribe and that of rurality has led to the refusal or thc Government of Delhi to list them as a Scheduled Tribe in the capital city — rather. they are included within the list or Scheduled Castes. Another curious distinction in the state or Assam is that between plains tribals and hill tribals, so the Garos, Karbis. I-lajongs, Dimasas. Mon-Tai speaking peoples. Singphos,k Hmars. Nagas. hill tribals, lose their scheduled status once they come down to the kplains and the Bodos. Lalungs, Mech-Kacharis, all plains tribals. lose their scheduled status if they go to the hills.

There are also other anomalies in the process of scheduling such as instances of increasing the communities within the Scheduled Tribes list in the state without simultaneously reserving electoral constituencies ror STs. There is also the concern kthat some tribes classified under the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) have not yet been notified as Scheduled Tribes, a situation that the NCST has taken up. In recent years. commentators have questioned the established criteria for inclusion as both outdated (since 'isolated existence' does not hold true for mostk communities today. even those living in remote forest areas) and derogatory to tribal kgroups (the idea or 'primitivism' is insulting to tribal culture and identity). Issues pertaining to scheduling criteria and anomalies have been examined in a report submitted by the Task Force set up on February 3. 2014 under the Chairmanship or Dr. I-Irusikesh Panda. Secretary, Ministry of Tribal AfTairs — and so no more need be said here.

## 4.2 De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
Scheduled Tribes in India are enormously diverse in terms of their populations. occupations. and lhe kinds of discriminations they face. There are also some communities which are known as ibes• but who are not necessarily included within the Scheduled Tribe list. Two other important governmental classifications of tribes which refer to specific histories and vulnerabilities of these communities arc: kDe-notified. Nomadic and Selni-Nomadic Tribes and Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).

The recent history of De-notified Tribes (DNTS) can be traced back to the Criminal Tribes Acts (CT A) or 1871 and later 1911 under which between 150 and 200 communities Were deemed to be 'hereditary criminals' and subject to surveillance, confinement and gross discrimination. The Acts represented the formalisation of a view held by the British for several decades before and are connected to previouslyk  existing prejudices against wandering and/or rebellious communities. The apparent purpose of the CTA was to contain and curb entire communities who were viewed as

### pg 58
•hereditarily criminar, in light or the then prevailing notion that crime was a genetic trait passed down from one generation to the next. All that was needed for declaration of a community as a CT Was "reason to believe' • (rather than any factual evidence) that the community was 'addicted' to crime.

A large proportion or the communities who came to be labelled as 'criminal • were notnadic groups whose diverse occupations led them to be itinerant communities. travelling from village to village practising their trade. These •wandering tribes' werek viewed as being Inore criminal than others since their restlessness and mobility itself was viewed as a sign or their criminality in a society wherein sedentary living Was associated with respectability. Some other such groups were said to have been employed as guards to landlords as well as henchmen to the king, often performing the dirty work of their employers and hence, earning some notoriety.

The CTA gave enormous powers to the local police force which could confine these communities to specific areas in Order to control their criminal activities. In later years, another draconian provision was added to the Act which allowed ror the creation or •settlements' ror criminal tribes. thereby forcibly sedentarising them and simultaneously forcing them into both agricultural and industrial work to •reform • and k•cure' their criminal propensities. Another provision of the Act allowed ror the creation or separate reformatory settlements tor the children of these tribes. The CTA was removed from the statute books in 1952 on the recommendation orthe All India Criminal Tribes Inquiry Committee (1949) and henceforth. •Criminal Tribes • came to be known as •De-notified Tribes• instead. Even though the law has been repealed, the identification or these communities as ethnic groups having crilninal antecedents continues to this day. leading to everyday discrimination in ktern1S or access to education and jobs as well as brutal violence by neighbouring conununities and police personnel.

Traditionally. de-notilied. nomadic and semi-nomadic communities practice a range of occupations and are remarkably internally diverse. Scholars have classified them according to four broad categories: l) pastoralists and hunter-gatherers. mainly shepherds. cowherds and hunters or small galne. 2) goods and service nomads. such as blacksmiths, stone workers. weapon makers. salt traders, basket makers and so on, 3)  entertainers including dancers. acrobats. snake channers. monkey trainers and wrestlers. and 4) religious perrormers. ascetics. devotional singers. minstrels and astrologers. I

However, a vast number of historical changes have jeopardised their livelihoods, beginning from the colonial period. Hunter-gatherers and pastoralists have been affected by the growing restrictions on access to grazing grounds and forests, the

### pg 59
degradation or natural resources as well as increasing privatintion or common property resources. Travelling goods and service communities have suffered as a result or mechanised production systems, the displacement or traditional building materials and the development or new infrastructure such as roads and railways. Further, entertainer communities have been destroyed as a result of wildlife conservation laws.

One major issue that has been raised with regard to de-notified and nomadic communities is the lack or proper enumeration and classification which madc the planning and implementation of welfare schemes difficult. Some of these communities have been listed as Scheduled Tribes. others as Scheduled Castes. and some as Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Further, as is the case with the ST list kitself. there are disparities in listings of the same group across States and eVen:within the same State. For example, the Kaikadis are listed as Scheduled Castes in the Vidharba region of Maharashtra. as Vimukta Jatis and Nomadic Tribes (VJNTs) in kthe rest or this State and as Scheduled Tribes in the neighbouring State of Andhra Pradesh. Similarly. the Banjaras are a Scheduled Tribe in Andhra Pradesh. Odisha and Bihar. a Scheduled Caste in States like Karnataka. Delhi and Rajasthan. OBC in Uttar Pradesh and a De-notified Tribe in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

While these anomalies have not been addressed. the situation of DNTs is exacerbated by the ract that many groups are not included under any list and are denied access to affirmative action policies and development programmes despite the historical (and continuing) injustice raced by these peoples. Moreover. in the absence of reliable data about the population. geographical spread and development indices among these []()groups. it is hard for policy-makers to plan an effective intervention strategy for kDNTs. According to some estimates. there are about 1 500 nomadic and semi-nomadic communities and 198 DC-notified Tribes in the Country.

## 4.3 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
Certain tribes have been characterised as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) (earlier known as Primitive Tribal Groups) on the basis or their greater •vulnerability • even among the tribal groups (although the precise contours of their kvulnerability has not been clearly defined). PVTGs. currently including 75 tribal groups. have been identified as such on the basis of the following criteria:

1) forest- dependent livelihoods.
2) pre-agricultural level of existence,
3) stagnant or declining population,
4) low literacy rates and
5) a subsistence-based economy.

As per the 2001 census, these 75 PVTGs had a total population of 27,68,322. The majority of the PVTG population lives in the six States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Odisha has 13 PVTGs,.he largest number for any State. Even within the groups labelled PVTGs by the State, there is considerable differentiation, most obviously with respect to size —

### pg 60
there are 19 groups with a population or less than 1000 persons and 8 groups with a population of more than one lakh.

The vulnerability of the PVTGs primarily steins from the loss or their traditional livelihoods. habitats and customary resource rights through the gradual exploitative intrusion of the market and State into their areas in the form of industrial projects. conservation efforts. tourism. and the rorest bureaucracy and so on. These conditions have led to the loss of their land and resouxes resulting in chronic malnutrition. starvation and ill health among these groups. The groups most under threat have been identified as the Shompens. Sentinelese and Jarawas of the Andaman Islands; the Rondos of Odisha: Cholanaickans or Kerala: Abujh Marias or Chhattisgarh and Birhors Jharkhand. Some PVTGs such as the Paudi Bhuiyan in Odisha are still not included within the list Scheduled Tribes.

One of the most critical issues to be addressed with regard to PVTGs is their perceived •primitivism' and •backwardness' evident in ollicial discourse. Although. the term •Pritnitive Tribal Groups' was replaced bv •Particularly' Vulnerable Tribal Groups' in 2006. the highly derogatory term •primitive' continues to be used by the government. media and NGOs. For instance. a look at the website or the Andaman and Nicobar administration on vulnerable tribal groups of the islands reveals the continued use or colonial depictions ot- tribes as •primitive- and •hostile'. On the kShompens. it is noted that "Shompens have been visiting the settlers and they are gradually shaking otT their shyess and indim•rent attitude towards the civilized It is essential ror government bodies to shed assumptions of tribal people" n backwardness and savagery. Moreover. even though it is imagined that PVTGs have lacked contact with other social groups and have to be protected from outside intrusion. it must be noted that these groups have had long histories of contact and change and it is precisely these exploitative encounters. which have contributed to their contemporary condition. Stereotyping or PVTGs as •backward- presumes a  []()linear trajectory of development and progress and devalues the culture and traditions or these communities with devastating effects.

It must be noted that all tribes in the list of PVTGs have not been granted Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. For example. the Abujh Maria has only recently been granted ST status in the State or Chhattisgarh even though they have been in the PVTG list earlier' The rationale behind inclusion and exclusion must be made clear and all discrepancies must be immediately addressed. Further. or the States with PVTGs. Kerala. Karnataka. Tamil Nadu. Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal do not have Scheduled Areas, thereby increasing the vulnerability of tllese tribes. "ho lack the protections and rights offered by the Fifth Schedule and the Provisions or Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996.

### pg 61
Their socio-economic vulnerability and low population levels has led them to be treated as •endangered • and 'on the verge of extinction' - terminology which denies them their full humanity. Rather than granting them their autonomy and rights to address historical injustices. this perception has led to disastrous State Government interventions in the name of their 'preservation•. One Such scheme has been the State policy disallowing members or PVTGs from availing of sterilisation schemes in government hospitals. Tribes such as the Paharias, Baigas„ Kamars and Pahari Korvas or Central India have been denied permanent methods of contraception in an attempt by the State to encourage population growth in thc face of their apparently dwindling numbers. 12 This policy originated in an order passed by the Madhya Pradesh government in 1979 to exclude vulnerable tribal communities from the wave or sterilisation drives taking place across north India. However, even decades (later, this order continues to be followed.

Such a policy denies members of PVTGs the autonomy to make free and informed reproductive choices, and particularly denies any agency and bodily autonomy to women ol- these communities. who have to bear the burden of the denial or access to sterilisation facilities. Moreover, it sidesteps the real factors contributing to high mortality rates such as chronic malnutrition. starvation and lack or access to adequate health facilities. On the other hand, in the Wayanad district of Kerala. Kattunayakan tribals are sometimes coerced or intimidated into undergoing sterilisation in order for health workers to meet necessary sterilisation targets. Both practices need to be condemned and it is necessary that the reproductive rights and or PVTGs be respected by the State. The real issue ror PVTGs is the non-provision of health facilities as well as denial of their right to sufficient, nutritious food.

Tribal groups such as the Sahariya in Baran, Rajasthan continue to work as bonded labour for rich landlords for generations. Many or them are agricultural labourers working under the hali system which is one of thc forms of bonded labour banned under the Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act 1976.13 Many Sahariyas were tricked into accepting loans wilh exorbitant interest rates and subsequently have had to work ror big landowners ithout wages. Tribal indebtedness is a huge problem. Olien leading to situations or bonded labour. Even anlong the Juang PVTGs in Odisha. many families are rorced to labour in repayment or their debt in a system locally called goli — despite the prevalence 01- the central law as well as the Orissa Debt Bondage (Abolition and Regulation) Act. 1948. Action must be taken to ensure that all PVTGs are removed froln bondage and freed 01- their debts.

Literacy rates among PVTGs are extremely low, most often much lower than even the State average for the Scheduled Tribe population. This is largely due to the abysmal

education infrastructure in tribal areas. poorly trained or absentee teachers. lack of teaching in tribal languages and irrelevant and alienating curriculum. Yet PVTG children are highly educated in many ways and possess considerable knowledge about agriculture. ores'S and so on which must be duly recognised. Any educational policy or programme PVTGs would need 10 lake account of their distinct culture in order 'o dcvclop a curriculum and pedagogic style which centralises their traditional skills. culture and language while introducing young people 10 diverse knowledge and from across the world.

Many PVTGs are forest dwellers and depend heavily on land and forest resources for their subsistence. Over lime. their habitat has been declared as Reserved Forest. Protected Forest, leaving them vulnerable to displacement and eviction without compensation. For instance. in 2009, 245 Baiga families were moved out of the Achanakmar Tiger Reserve. when il was notified under Project Tiger.' 4 The housing colonics built for their rehabilitation soon began to collapse. they did not receive pattas for their new farmland and they did nol get thc full compensation owed to them under the Project Tiger relocation scheme. The Baiga families were relocated to an area where their traditional forest livelihood of collecting Sal and Tendu leaves as well as bamboo was no longer feasible. In Tamil Nadu- the Kattunayakans. a tribe of honey-collectors. who live on the fringes or the Mudlllnalai Wildlife Sanctuary. a 321-square-kilometre park. are being prevented from collecting honey as well as other produce lion] the forest area due to immense harassment from forest guards. IS The adivasis here are denied their rights to access the lörest in complete violation or the Forest Rights Act. 2006 Wllicll has yet to be implemented in the State or Tamil Nadu. It is essential that the habitat rights or PVTGs as guaranteed by the FRA be recognised by the Forest l)epartment and the clailns filed by forest-dwelling []()conununilies be granted at Ihe earliest. 11 is crucial that their lands and habitats be protected from any intrusions and that displacement be prevented.

Habitat rights li)r PVTGs as guaranteed by the Forest Rights Act must be granted to thein and delinilional as well as procedural ambiguities must be cleared up. Section 3( I )(e) or lhe FRA recognises lhe "rights including comlnunity tenures or habitat and habitation primitive tribal groups and pre-agricultural communities" and Section 2(h) defines •habital• as the "area comprising lhe customary habitat and such Other habitats in Reserved Forests and protected Ibresls or Prilnilive Tribal Groups and pre- agricultural communities and other forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes". The FRA Antendlnenl Rules now provide that. "In view or the dtherenlial vulnerability of PVTGs. lhe District Level Committee shall ensure that all PVTGs are conferred habitat rights, in consultation with their concerned traditional institutions and that their claims for habitat rights are filed belöre the concerned Gram Sabhas". State

### pg 63
Governments need to be urged to recognise habitat rights over revenue land in addition to habitat rights over lutest land (granted by the FRA). Except ror the Madia in Maharashtra and the Chuktin Bhunjia. Mankadia, Dongrin-Khond. Juang. and Khadias in Odisha, there have been few elli)rts to clailn habitat rigllts. In order ror this to occur. it would be necessary for the government to clear up the confusions regarding definition or habitat: clashes between traditional and State/district boundaries: claims to habitat rights in protected areas such as liger reserves: and habitat rights displaced P V •l'(is.

What has onen occurred in the past is that development programmes have been imposed on PVTGs without considering their own priorities and development needs. In the current Inoment. a Inove away from the one-size-fits-all approach to development is absolutely essential.16 An enabling enviromnent must be created in which eonununities empoxsered to make their own choices about the path or development they Hould like to follow and the livelihoods they wish to adopt. No instead all wellilre development project can be imposed on PVTGs projects/plans/schemes must move ronvard only with their inlörmed consent as well as their participation in the process of planning and decision-making. As the National Advisory Council recommendations have noted. there is a significant risk that vulnerabilities may be exacerbated rather than reduced through government intervention and therefore due caution must be exercised in all cases. Programmes should not have the em•ct or undermining their self-sulliciency and their own development priorities must be the driving torce of government action. Vulnerabilities must be addressed through taking account or their rood production and distribution systems and their rich repertoire or traditional skills and knowledge.

## 4.4 Scheduled Areas
In the wake of tribal rebellions in the nineteenth century. the British became convinced or the vulnerability or tribal populations in the lorm or various •outsiders- and assumed the role or paternalist protectors or tribals against the non-tribal exploiters. This brand or protectionism. however. worked to justil}' British presence in tribal areas as the guardian or their interests. Indeed, British policy toward tribals rolloned a contradictory path: on the one hand. it advocated protection or these areas through exclusion from the operation or general laws and on the other hand. it racilitated assimilation with the larger social structures through the market. Even prior to the development ofa delineation or the characteristic features ofa tribe, there existed a separate system of governance for predominantly tribal areas markedl

### pg 64
by special legal provisions and the non-applicability or general laws in these areas. Thus. the creation or distinctive tribal spaces in legal-administrative terms preceded the classification 01' specilic groups as tribes based on established criteria. These areas are refeared as Scheduled Aleas in the post-Independencc period.

in the Singhbhum area. ror example. the British introduced a system or administration. Similar to thal in place in Ratngarh and Jungle Mahals through Regulation XIII or 1833. Wilkinson's Rules meant the withdlttwal or regulations in torce in other parts Of British India and the assigmnent 01' all governance in the district to the Political Agent to the Governor-General. These areas came to be known as Non-Regulation Provinces and welQ to be governed by special rules ror civil and criminal justice. collection or land levenue. and so on. In 1874, another law was passed which renamed the non-regulation tracts as Scheduled Districts and defined their geographical boundaries. In the Northeast region. in addition. the British put in force the Inner Line Regulation in 1873. as the point beyond which general laws ror the colony would not be applicable and entry Of subjects living outside the area was strictly prohibited.

The separation of these areas continued with the Government or India Act. 1919 which renatned the Scheduled Tracts as •Backward Tracts • and also distinguished between •really backward tracts' wherein the Governor General was exclusively responsible for law and administration and the •backward tracts' wherein the Governor General could act through local ollicials. 'I-his nomenclature was altered to •wholly excluded areas' and •partially excluded aleas• respectively by lhe Simon Commission according to the level Of backwardness. The Government 01' India Act. 1935! lölloued from this. stating that the Governor could determine policy directly or through his agents in the tribal areas and prohibited legislative Council members from asking any questions about the administration or the excluded areas. Functionaries of the colonial gm. ernment were. therefore. singularly responsible lar about 15 million people in the sub-continent.

The role orthe Agent of the Governor-General in these areas was two-tald: to protect the tribal the non-tribal populations and 10 exert a civilizing influence on them through programmes Of reform. The policy or exclusion came from the belier or the colonial government that their government would be best for the tribals and that the Indian government would only impose dominant cultural values on them. Thus. a special class Of areas with tribal-majority populations was ClQated. within which a distinctive legal framework would operate with Ihe IOIlowing characteristics: rule by district OIT1cers under the governor, simple procedures in dispute sett lement, restriction of entry or non-tribals, the exclusion or these areas from thc operation or ordinary laws.

One of the primary features of the Partially Excluded areas was that no general laws would apply to these areas, unless the Governor saw it fit to apply these legislations.

### pg 65
In the post-1947 period. however. this reature was altered vis-i-vis the Fifth Schedule areas since now all Central and Stale laws would automatically apply to tribal areas unless the Governor took the decision to prevent application or modiry/amcnd the legislation in keeping with the circumstances or the Scheduled Areas. Rarely do Governors invoke this power leading to a situation where in all legislations. irrespective or their suitability in Scheduled Areas. arc operational without any amendment or alteration.

At the same time. one or the assumptions behind the creation or these spaces was the idea that the tribes could not cope with the complexity of representative institutions. The Montagu-Chelmsford Report which was to later form the basis of the Government of India Act. 1919 even noted that "there was no political material on which to found political institutions" in these areas.

The demand political autonomy by tribals was Overlooked. despite several on- going agitations for political rights. Further. this view neatly separated the related issues Of social and economic well-being and political power. The resultant policies were based on the economic integration of tribals through development programmes while attempting to ensure that the cultural aspects Of their society such as language and customs were len untouched. This understanding Of the tribal question continued into the post-colonial period. the Constitution Of India continued with this systemjor governance through the separate. but inter-linked categories or Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Areas.

Similar to Scheduled Tribes. the definition for Scheduled Areas (under the Fifth Schedule or the Constitution) is "such areas as the President may by order declare to be Scheduled Areas". The criterion 'Or the declaration of an area as a Scheduled Area was identified by the first Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission (Dhebar Commission). The lizatures of such an area were: thc preponderance or tribal population. compactness and reasonable size or the area. under-developed nature or the area. and marked disparity in the economic standard or the people. Several orders relating to Scheduled Areas have been passed by the President over the years. The mesent Scheduled Areas follows the pattern Of the erstwhile Partially Excluded Aleas- although more orders regarding Scheduled Areas have bccn passed by the President in lhe post-independence period. Since 1976. there have been efforts to ensure that the Scheduled Areas coincide with the Tribal Sub-Plan areas through several orders. although this task is still not complete.

It is important 10 reiterate that there are several tribal-populated and tribal-dominant areas across the country which are not Scheduled Areas and therefore, are not covered by the protections offered under the Fiftll Schedule. These include tribals living in the nine States of India which have Scheduled Areas as well as those living outside of these States — lor example, in West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa,

### pg 66
Tamil Nadu. Kerala. and Karnataka and the Union Territories of Daman and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Lakshadweep. and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

For example. the Southern region comprising Karnataka. Kerala and Tamil Nadu comprise over five per cent orthe total Scheduled Tribe population. Kamataka alone has 50 recognised tribal groups within its State boundaries while Tamil Nadu has 37 Scheduled Tribes and Kerala has 36 Scheduled Tribes. A large proportion orthe tribal population or South India belongs to the Nilgiri hills region. covering all these three States. Although. a survey by the British in 1847 apparently revealed that about 78 per Cent or the people in the Nilgiri plateau region were tribal hunter-gatherers. pastoralists and shifting cultivators. these areas were never scheduled. possibly due to British economic interests in the emerging plantation economy.' 7 Tribals in this region race serious problems of landlessness. land alienation. malnutrition, bonded labour. eviction from National parks and Sanctuaries. as well as displacement due to mines and hydroelectric projects. Houever. by and large. discussions around tribal rights tend to focus on Fifth and Sixth Schedule Areas to the neglect of other non- Scheduled regions with substantial tribal populations.

On the question Of Scheduled Areas. the Bhuria Commission (2002-2004) requested the governments in the various States with sizeable tribal populations to comment on the existing criteria for scheduling or areas through an assessment or their validity within the contemporary Context and through recommendations that could make the given criteria more specific and precise. For example. it remains unclear What exactly •preponderance- Of tribals means in terns of percentages Of the population. There is also the question Of the size the administrative unit within which •preponderance• is necessary — at the of the district or the block or the village. This is an especially important question given that there has been considerable in-migration or non-tribuls to Scheduled Areas as well as non-Scheduled areas with large tribalk populations. This influx has changed the relative population or tribal and non-tribal communities in the area. Otien uorsening the disparity bet"een the two groups.

The State Governments. in response to the Bhuria Commission. provided several suggestions on this issue. with some calling ror changes in the criteria while others declaring their satisfaction the Status quo as regards their States-18 The State Government of Chhattisgarh noted that while it has about 81.669 sq. km as Scheduled Areas. there are 88.000 sq. km in the state under the Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP). thus creating a disparity which must be addressed hy making Scheduled Areas coterminous with TSP areas. They further suggested the condition Of 50% Scheduled Tribe population ror declaration Of Scheduled Area as as the treatment Of the Gram Sabha as a viable unit. Madhya Pradesh. on the other hand, has suggested a norm of 40% tribal population in a block and Gram Panchayat for eligibility. The

### pg 67
government also argued that human development indices may not be a viable standard for exclusion from Scheduled Areas. since there is considerable economic and social differentiation between and within tribal groups. Thc Rajasthan government recommended that the backwardness or an area be assessed. according to the following parameters: ST female literacy and availability Of sare drinking water. healthcare. and electricity. Based on these suggestions. the Bhuria Commission recommended:

a) that the notification gfScheduled Areas should include villages as "'ell us lou•ns and cities in the blocks, tehsils and districts, including all foresi und revenue lands h) 'hat all lhe Integraled Tribal Development Projec,'s (ITDPs). Modified Developmem Approach (MAD.•I) pockets included in the Tribal Sub-Plan should he considered for nonficarion as Scheduled Areas .suhjec,' to conformity ll•ilh the established standards. The parameters ror further inclusion of nonscheduled Areas within the ambit or the Fifth Schedule must be debated by the central and State Governments and action must be taken in this regard immediately. The situation wherein a substantial number Of Scheduled Tribes reside outside or the Scheduled Areas needs to be addressed to ensure that tribes are not denied the protections orrered by the Constitution and Other legislations pertaining to Scheduled Areas. Given the onslaught or global market []()rorces on tribal lands. the extension or such provisions is or the utmost imponance and urgency.

## Section 11: Legal and Administrative Framework in Scheduled Areas
In the post-colonial period. the classification of an area (which may range in size from a single village to a block to an entire district within a State) as a Scheduled Area carries significant legal and political implications since it is On this basis that the provisions of either lhe Filth or thc Sixth Schedule apply. 19 These constitutional arrangements for the Scheduled Tribes rollow patterns and provide for both protections From non-tribals (particularly on land alienation. money-lending and political representation) and provisions lar autonomous decision-making on various matters. These framev,orks constitute the n•cognilion orthe adverse inclusion or tribal communities within the global political economy as well as the distinctiveness or tribal culture and identity threatened by the cultural imperialism or thc non-tribal majority. At lhe satne lime. it must be noted Illat several Of these provisions are paternalistic in nature and are not entirely adequate to the onerous task orensuring the protection of tribal land and resources given lhe current context or liberalisation. Morcovcr. cxpcricncc funclioning of institutions created under these constitutional provisions demonstrates that stricter implementation and further strengthening or laws is an urgent necessity. This section examines the various arrangements instituted ror the Scheduled Tribes and brieny analyses the strengths

### pg 68
and weaknesses of each. Such an analysis is essential in order to objectively assess whether these provisions have fulfthed their stated goals over the last sixty years and to begin a discussion on potential mechanisms to strengthen their functioning in the future.
## 4.5 The Fifth Schedule
The basis or the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution can be traced back to the laws of the British colonial government designating certain parts Of the sub-continent •backward tracts' and •partially excluded areas'. The latter term was incorporated into the Constitution and it is within these tracts labelled Scheduled Areas (wherein a large number of Scheduled Tribes reside. alongside other relevant criteria) that the Fifth Schedule is applicable. The debate around the Fifth Schedule, its relevance and its emcacy vis-å-vis the intentions of the Constitution makers are as contentious today as they were during the debates orthe Constituent Assembly.

During the debates regarding the provisions of the Constitution or the modern Indian nation. the issue or the administration Of the Scheduled Tribes generated heated debates on the post-colonial State's policy toward and legislation on adivasi communities. Largely. nationalist leaders and social reformers favoured the assimilation of tribals into •mainstream• Indian society. and their views were pitted against those or the British administrators and anthropologists who advocated isolationism or protection. These contrasting positions were reflected in the famous debate bemeen G.S. Ghur»• and Verrier Elwin in which the latter argued ror a policy Of protection of the •tribal way or life- and the liwmer slated that those in favour or isolation sought a revival of the past. and that Elwin's position ignored the histories of tribal migration and intermingling with non-tribal populations. While both views were heard out. the policy ultimately adopted was a middle ground or 'controlled integration-. lhe middle ground advocated by then Prime Minister Shri. Jawaharlal Nehru. nere nas- therefore. recognition of dilli:rence. even il- this was done in the pursuit of its eventual erasure. An approach or simultaneous •protection- and •uplift • was stressed.

The belier that tribal areas required special laws led to the setting up or the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights and Minorities by the Constituent Assembly.1947. This body appointed three sub-committees in 1947 to look into specific tribal areas and make suggestions Ivor their administration and runctioning. The first was authorized to look into the excluded and panially excluded aæas •other than Assam • and was headed by Shri- A.V. Thakkar. the second to examine tribal areas within undivided Assam chaired by Shri. Gopinath Bardoloi, and the third was to analyse the situation of tribes in the North Western Frontier Province. The proposals of the first two committees were later incorporated as the Fifth and Sixth Schedules or the Indian Constitution.

### pg 69
The repoll or the Joint Sub-Committee described tribal society as "lacking in such civilizing facilities as roads. schools. dispensaries and water supply' •.20 Tribal people are described as "extremely simple people who can be and are exploited with ease by plainsfolk". Hence. a policy of protectionism would be necessary since "sudden disruption or the tribal customs and ways by exposure to the impact or a more complicated and sophisticated Inanner Of is capable of doing great harm"21 At the same time, it was argued that isolationism was not the solution since only a continuous process or assimilation into mainstream Indian (and Hindu) society would lead to their •development The debate on the tribal question took place on 5th and 6th September. 1949 and the main locus remained on this issue - "reconciling the diversity or custom with the •national lire orthe country".

The Fifth Schedule (Article 244(1)) or the Constitution finally adopted by the Constituent Assembly did not include several 01' the recommendations or the sub- committees and Assemerbly Inembers. The Fifth Schedule contains provisions relating to the administration of Scheduled Areas other than in Northeast India. First, areas can be designated Scheduled Areas on the order of the presideht. who can similarly declare that certain parts ot7enti1æ Scheduled Areas cease to be such. Second, the Governor or each State having Scheduled Areas shall annually, or whenever required by the President or India. submit a report to the President regarding the administration Of Scheduled Areas. Currently. certain parts or nine States or the country are covered by the Fifth Schedule. The broad list or Scheduled Areas is as follows:

![[Pasted image 20220110110045.png]]


### pg 70
![[Pasted image 20220110110123.png]]

Parl B of the Fifth Schedule provides for the creation ora Tribes Advisory Council (TACI in each State having Scheduled Areas (and if the President directs. also in States having Scheduled Tribes but not Scheduled Areas). consisting or tuenty menlbers of three-founhs must be representatives or Scheduled Tribes in the I.egislative Assembly of that State. The duty of the TAC is to advise on matters perlaining to the • •well-are and advancement" or the Scheduled Tribes "as may be referred to them by the Governor". Further, the Fifth Schedule grants extensive powers to the Governor who. by public notification. may direct that a law enacted by the Parliament or the State Legislative Assembly shall not apply to a Scheduled Area. or may apply subject to certain amendments or restrictions as he/she specifies. The Governor may only make such regulations on consultation with the concerned Tribes Advisory Council and subject to the final assent orthe President. The section states:

The Governor may make regulations for peace and good of any area in a Slate 'rhich is for lhe lime being a Scheduled Area. In particular und "'ilhoul prejudice 10 lhe generality Of the foregoing ptnrer, such regulations may- (a) prohibit or reslricl the 'ransrer ofland or among members of lhe Scheduled Tribes in such area: (h' regulate 'he allotment of land to members lhe Scheduled Tribes in such area: (c) regulate lhe carrying un business as money-lender hy persons u•ho lend money 10 members of 'he Scheduled Tribes in such areas

These provisions were viewed as essential in view Of the historical fact that adivasi livelihoods depend on the land and that alienation Of resources had led to considerable impoverishment of adivasis during the colonial period. Nonetheless. the initial reconnnendations of the conunittees and the earlier draft or the Fifth Schedule accorded greater autonomy to tribal areas than the final version. which uatered d0"n the role 01• the Tribes Advisory Council to a mere consultant rather than an autonomous decision-making body. A Member or the Constituent Assembly. Shri. Jaipal Singh. had argued against this version or the Schedule and delnanded instead: a statutory obligation that a report on the Scheduled Areas and Tribes be submitted by the Governor annually. that TACs be compulsorily set up in all States has ing Scheduled Tribes and not just in those States having Scheduled Areas. that the Governor should be bound 10 carry out the decisions of the TAC regarding the modification and amendment or laws made by Parliament or the State Legislature. Singh noted that the new dran (the one finally incorporated into the Constitution) made the Fifth Schedule considerably less powerful than he had hoped and k"emasculated the Tribes Advisory Council". Lamenting the lack or powers to the tribal people themselves and their representatives in the TAC, Singh stated:

### pg 71
"the whole pattern of the original draft was to bring the tribes advisory council into action =. it could initiate, originate things, but, somehow or other, the tables have now been turned. the initiative is placed in the hands of the governor or ruler of the state." 24"

Another Constituent Assembly member. Shri. Yudhishtir Misra. held that the TAC should not onlv he allowed to advise on the "'yselrare and advancement" or tribes. but also more broadly on the administration Of lhe Scheduled Areas. Moreover. Misra •,sarned that the advisory powers of the TAC should not be circumscribed by the "hims and fancies of the executive as seemed likely given the current form of the Vilih Schedule — which states that lhe TAC can only advise on matter referred to it by thc Governor. Ilowevcr. their suggestions refused by their colleagues in the Asselnbly who believed that the v.ork Of the TAC must not be Ofa political nature on the grounds that it might lead to separatism and that tribals would not themselves be able to comprehend the complexities of -making. Rather than grant genuine autonomy to tribal India. the Fifth Schedule paternalistically placed their welläre in the hands or a representative of the Centre.

Unlike the Sixth Schedule wherein Autonomous District Councils have been given significant legislative. judicial and executive powers on several important matters. the Fifth Schedule places thc governance or tribal areas in •mainland" India largely in the hands or the Governor. This occurred t" o reasons: one. mainland areas had large non-tribal populations and two. the tribes of the Northeast were seen as morek advanced and capable Of self-governance unlike tile tribes in other parts or the sub- []()continent. As a result. tribes were given •proleclion• li•om outside intrusions and land alienation bul were not granted Inuch autonomy on political and economic matters.

## 4.5. I Governor's Report
Over the years. States with Scheduled Areas have developed a framework around which the Governor's reports are to be presented. According to the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission Report (2002-200-1). the Governor •s report is kexpected to contain an ollieclive and independent assessment of lhe qualit> the kadlllinislralion or Scheduled Arvos, the implenwntalion 01' protective salZ•guards for tribals. and lhe regulations made the (itnernor in keeping with his powers under []()It should fill-ther cover issues Ot-displacement and rehabilitation, lhe Fiftll Schedule-h law and order problem. tribal protests. atrocities against tribes. and so on. This report  []()is required 10 be placed hetare the •VAC their advice and recommendations. On lhek basis or this Report. lhe Union Govern.nent may issue directives to the Slate Governlnenls 101" better administration 01' these areas.

According to the Bhuria Commission Repoll (2002-2004), at the time or their writing. the States of Andhra Pradesh and Mad11Y1 Pradesh did not send their reports since

### pg 72
1999-2000. while Maharashtra and Orissa had not sent theirs 170m 2000-2001 onward. Only Himachal Pradesh has submitted its report regularly. In more recent years. the Ministry of Tribal Allhirs reports that, as of 25.5.2013, it had received Goi ernor•s Reports ror the year 2011-12 only from Gujarat and was Still awaiting reports from the other eight States. Maharashtra had not subnlitted its report lor the previous year 2010-11 either.

even when the reports are sent ægularly. there have been several questions raised regarding the quality and value of the reports. Critics have pointed out that the reports are repetitive. casually and haphazardly constructed and tend to borrow heavily from reports or the tribal welfare department. merely listing out the schemes and programmes for tribal development without even examining their inlplementation and enicacy on the ground. Pressing issues such as the impacts of insurgency and counter- insurgency on tribal populations and displacement by big industry rarely lind kmention. The Governor's Reports offer quantitative rather than qualitative or analytical data about the status of tribal administration in the concerned States — even the statistical in ronnation presented relates to the now Of development funds to tribal villages and the number of beneficiaries Of government wellhre schemes. The reports do not Offer an independent assessment Of the policies Of the State Governments vis- []()å-vis Scheduled Areas and instead seem to uncritically accept government claims or tremendous achievements with regard to tribal development.

A confidential report sent to the President by the National Commission Scheduled Tribes (accessed by Dou•n to Earlh magazine in 20 13) has also complained or the failure or Governors in perronning their administrative duties to ensure selr- governance in tribal areas. the National Commission advocated that Governors be made more accountable with regard to their roles Vis-å-vis Scheduled Areas. namely ensuring the implementation or constitutional provision protecting tribal rights. Most importantly the Governor should ensure that all laws which contradict the constitutional protections tribals should be repealed Or modified in Scheduled Areas. The NC ST further recommended that the Ministry or Tribal Allhirs prepare a detailed t•omlat Cor submission of the Govemor•s reports which could include a review or all Central and State laws and their compatibility with Constitutional provisions ror Scheduled Tribes and consultation with the TACs. Other experts have also advocated the inclusion oran Action Taken Report (AIR) lor the previous year in the report of the subsequent >ear. Where such regulations have been made. they primarily pertain to control of land alienation and money lending in tribal areas and do not venture to cover the spectrum or issues that may be covered under the • •peace and good government" or the area. -there are several instances in which the Governor has exercised his powers to make regulations. In Odisha. these regulations have included the Odisha Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property (By Scheduled

### pg 73
Tribes) Regulation 1956. Odisha Scheduled Area Money-I-enders kegulation 1967. and lhe Odisha Schedule Area Debt Relier Regulation. However, reviews of the implementation or these regulations (as well as similar laws seeking to stem land aliemtion and money-lending in tribal areas) points to their failure owing to excessive dependence on the powerful mainstream bureaucracy unwilling to acknowledge tribal rights over land and forest. Morc recently. the Bhuria Commission Repoll has further recommended the inclusion Of another subject under which the Governor could exercise his powers — for the regulation or trade and commerce in the Scheduled Areas orthe State.

In April 2012, Union Minister for Tribal Affairs, Dr. V. Kishore Chandra Deo requested the Governor or Andhra Pradesh. Shri. E.S.L Narsimhan, to use his powers under the Fifth Schedule to cancel a Memorandum Of Understanding (MoU) signed by the Government tar bauxite mining in Fifth Schedule areas Of Visakhapatnam district. It has also been noted that when Governors do exercise their Fifth Schedule powers. it is only on the advice or the Council or Ministers. Activists have complained that Governors never respond to petitions calling ror their intervention in cases 01' land conflicts. acquisition tar mineral extraction and police atrocities against tribal communities.

In order to assist the Governor in the rulfilment Of the Constitutional duties of his/her office. the creation of a special Governor's Cell to work specifically on issues pertaining to the Scheduled Tribes has begun in several States. The governments of chhattisgarh, jharkhand, maharashtra and rajasthan have informed the ministry of tribal affairs that they have constituted the governor's cell in their states, although the details of their functioning are not yet known. the governor's office in andhra pradesh has noted that there is no need for such a cell in the state since the tribal welfare department is capable of performing the same duties. the state of madhya pradesh has informed the ministry that there was no consensus on the creation of such a cell. according to the government of himachal pradesh. such a cell has already been formed in their state.

The proposed composition as per the directives of the Ministry of tribal affairs in a letter to states with Scheduled Areas (dated December 8.2010) is as follows:

1. Secretary (I-lead)
2. Deputy Secretary•s Level Ollicer (one Anthropology subject expert)
3. One Law and Constitution expert or Deputy Secretary rank
4. Deputy Director (anthropology subject expert)
5. Research Officer/Section Officer (one) (Research Officer should be subject expert in Anthropology/Sociology)
6. Two Assistantsrrechnical Assistants/LegaI Assistants
7. Other supporting staff— data entry operator.

### pg 74
The tarmation of the Governor's Cell is a longstanding necessity in order ror the Governor to properly carry out the duties orthe post vis-å-vis protection orthe tribes.  It is imperative that the Cell be set up in all the Fifth Schedule Staies and that these Cells function independently and conscientiously. Most importantly. the Cell should be prevented from becoming simply another bureaucratic institution among many performing its tasks mechanically with little autonomy or interest tribal affairs.

## 4.5.2 Tribes Adviersory Councils
These Councils have been set up in all the nine States having Scheduled Areas as well as two other States, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu- both having sizeable tribal populations. As discussed above, there are several shortcomings inherent in the structure and mandate of the TACs as laid down in the Constitution. Firstly. the T ACS can only discuss and make recommendations on those issues which are referred to it by the Governor. Secondly, it functions only in an advisory capacity and has no power of implementation. Thirdly, the Councils are not accountable to the tribal population given that they are appointed by the Governor or the State Government.

![[Pasted image 20220110111310.png]]

a detailed stufy of the minutes of the meetings of the tribes advisory councils by the asian indigenous and tribal peoples's network [[2012]] reveals that the meetings of the councils are almost tokenistic and critical issues (such as land alienation) are rarely discussed (28). further, the resolutions of the council are not followed up in subsequent meetings and the implementation of their recommendations is not independently verified. The issue of the representativeness of the TACs is also a central issue — while three-fourths or the members are to be tribal MLAs from the concerned State, the non-official, nominated members include the Chiet- Minister or the State (often the Chairperson of the TAC) and bureaucrats.

### pg 75
the States' rules ror the appointment 01' members hold that they shall be appointed. either the State Government (Rajasthan 'I'ribes Advisory Council Rules) or the Gmx•rnor (Andhra Pradesh TAC Rules and Jharkhand TAC Rules) with no specifying criteria. It is the State (Govermnents rather than the Governor which have framed the rules regarding TAC runctioning has led to the near complete usurpation or these bodies by the political parties in po"er both in terms or representation within the Councils as well as the issues that are taken up for discussion.

the Gujarat Tribes Advisory Council Rules, 1960 provides that "No business shall be transacted and no proposition shall be moved or discussed at any meeting, unless it has been specified in the notice ror convening the meeting." The 'Jharkhand Tribes Advisory Council Rules states that only those matters shall be discussed in the Council has been to the Council by the Governor ror advice.

the Andhra Pradesh TAC (as or 2009) consists of the Minister of Tribal Welfare. Andhra Pradesh (Chairperson); the Principal Secretary to Government or Andhra Pradesh ('I W), Social Welliu•e Department (Member); the Director for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Government of India (Member): the Director of Tribal Cultural Research and Training Institute. Hyderabad (Member); Ihe Commissioner of Tribal Welfare. Government of Andhra Pradesh (Member Secretary); and 15 tribal MLAs. The Chhattisgarh TAC (as or 2009)comprises the Chief Minister (Chairperson). the Minister or Scheduled •l ribes and Schedule Caste Development Department (Vice Chairperson): 15 Scheduled Tribe MLAs (Members): three a 'embers 01' Parliament (nominated as Members); and Secretary. Scheduled Tribes and scheduled castes development department. chhattisgarh government (secretary), clearly then, a large portion of the members are state functionaries and there are few independent persons with experience and expertise on tribal issues who are nominated to the council.

Further. the members 01' the TAC have rew powers even in terms of what can be discussed at the Council Ineetings. For instance.- the Chhattisgarl TAC rules states taken up that. apart matters returred to il by the Governor, "No issue shall discussion and included in the proceedings and no proposals shall be p ssed in a Ineeting unless the issue has been mentioned in the notice the meeting. hösever. the Chairperson can. using his discretion. permit such issues to be taken up .t@r proceedings. that he thinks necessary and are in the direction 01' the Inotto or the Council at large but was excluded in the notice." The Bhuria kConunission Report (2002-04) places on record the dismay or some members of various State Councils who cojnplain that the State Government do not put any important matters to the Council tor advice. In all these years or its functioning, thc TACs have rarely made any significant policy proposals or recommendations on tribal and developmental issues. 
### pg 76
Even when issues are taken up by the TAC,it has been noted that there is rarely any sustained and consistent engagement with the matter in the form or follow-ups and field visits. As per the minutes or their meetings, none or the T ACS discussed the issue of land alienation among tribals between thc years 2005 and 201 1. In the case of thc Himachal Pradesh T AC. an excess or items were placed before the Council for discussion but many seem to have been subject to only a cursory examination and no decisive conclusions were reached. For example, the Asian Indigenous and Tribal Peoples' Network (AITPN) report notes that at the 36th meeting held on 12 May 2006. 102 items were discussed; 104 items were discussed at the 38th meeting on 2 August 2007. and 88 items (including 21 follow up items and 67 new items) were discussed in the 40th meeting held on 15 May 2010. As a result, no single issue or group of issues could be seriously analysed and rew concrete decisions could be made or implemented.
 
 In 2012, the extremely limited powers or agenda-setting within the TAC came to the forc when two members of the Jharkhand TAC walked out of a Council meeting on thc grounds that the Chairman of the TAC was uninterested in taking up serious problems or the tribal population. The specific matter which the members protested was land acquisition at Nagri for construction or India Institute of Management (11M) and National University ror Study and Research in Law. The Chairperson. however, did not allow discussion on the subject, stating that it be brought before the Council in writing first. The Chairperson-s statement was countered by the members on the grounds that several memorandums had been submitted to the Council already and hence must be placed for discussion.

 There continue to be complaints regarding the , and actual powers or the Governor with regard to the TAC as wéil on the point or issues to be discussed within the Council. While the Constitution holds that the TAC can hold deliberations on matters referred to it by the Governor. experts have argued over whether the Governor as the Constitutional head or the State can make this on his own discretion or only on the advice of the Council or Ministers. The question is central since the answer could shape future interpretations orthe Fifth Schedule as well as the extent of control or various State Governments over the functioning or TACs. In recent years. the Central Government itself has given two contradictory interpretations on this issue sir,ce. in 2010, the Attorney-General Shri. G.E. Vahanvati opined that the Governor did have discretionary powers, but in 2013. the Assistant Solicitor General. Smt. Fouzia Mirza stated that the Governor can employ his powers on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers and not at his own discretion. This statement was made to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by activist Shri. B.K. Manish in the Chhattisgarh High Court (later dismissed) questioning the un-Constitutional functioning of the TACs, which was later argued through a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court. In light of this case, the Ministry or Law and Justice issued a circular to all law omcers in July, 2013 clarifyirig that Attoniéy General Shri. Vahanvati'sk opinion 
### pg 77
affirming the discretionary powers of the Governor was the official stand of the Government or India.

Even when serious debate does occur at the TAC, the Council does not töllow up on latest development and implementation on their recommendations. The Andhra Pradesh TAC took up the matter or the Polavaram project at its meeting in February 2007 and Inade the following resolutions: that all landless families to be displaced by the project should be given land in the resettlement areas, resettlement land should bek identified in consultation with tribals. a publicity campaign on the R&R package should be held in all affected villages. and the TAC members should visit these villages. Between that meeting and their meeting in March 201 1, however. no further inquiry or discussion of the issue was initiated and the matter seems to have been forgotten entirely.

Since the formation of the first TAC in Andhra Pradesh in 1958 until January 2012. 105 meetings of the Council have been held. But since 2006, the APT AC has stopped examining the action taken on decisions made in previous meetings. as was the practice earlier. The concerned departments do not always submit Action Taken Reports to the TAC and therefore. the earlier decisions and recommendations of the TACs. even when implemented. are not revisited in subsequent meetings (as reflected kin the minutes). This is true of the Councils in almost all or the States.

## 4.6 Legal and Administrative Structures in Northeast India
Northeast India. ethnic groups and located strategically with borders with Bhutan. China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Historically. tribes Of this region have seen "isolationist" poiicies of the colonial British who labelled many hilly tribal tracts of the Northeast as "wholly excluded" areas. While the tribal- dominated areas in what is commonly referred to as •mainiand' India are laruely uoverned by the provisions. or the Fifth Schedule, the States or the Northeast are covered by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution as well as a host of other legal and administrative arrangements for the protection or tribal autonomy.
 
 As early as 1929. the Nagas submitted a petition to the Simon Commission. askiå•• ror autonomy from the future Indian nation-state. Other tribes such as the Khasis and thC Mizos called for self-governance on issues such as customary laws. control over resources and so on. while also demanding separation from the larger State or Assam. Several tribes including the Nagas, Mizos. Garos, Khasis and Karbis (and. in some cases, still are) demanding a united homeland for all their fellow tribes people who are spread across several Indian States and even across international borders.
