Mehrgarh was probably one of the places where people learned to grow barley and wheat, and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this area.
It is one of the earliest villages that we know about.
At this site, many animal bones were found. Bones of wild animals such as deer and pigs, and also bones of sheep and goats were found.
Other finds at Mehrgarh include remains of square or rectangular houses.
Each house had four or more compartments, some of which may have been used for storage.
When people die, their relatives and friends generally pay respect to them.
People look after them, perhaps in the belief that there is some form of life after death.
Burial is one such arrangement. Several burial sites have been found at Mehrgarh.
In one instance, the dead person was buried with goats, which were probably meant to serve as food in the next world.
