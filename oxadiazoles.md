it's a new class of antibiotics.
recently discovered oxadiazoles can treat antibiotic-resistant infections such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa.
mrsa is a bacterium that developed resistance to penicillin & certain other groups of antibiotics.
mrsa has become a global public-health problem since 1960s  b/c of its resistance to antibiotics.
only 3 drugs currently are effective treatments, & resistance to each of those drugs already exists.
researchers have been seeking a solution to mrsa for years.
oxadiazole is only available antibiotic for mrsa that can be taken orally.
