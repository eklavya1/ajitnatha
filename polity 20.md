# article 44
- ÊôÇ - `02:00 AM 21/8/2021`
- ![[a44 Uniform civil code]]
- uniform civil code (UCC)- refers to a collection of laws in form of a code that would be applicable to all communities in their personal matters (marriage , divorce , adoption, etc)
- history of ucc goes back to british times when a report in [[1835]] emphasised upon uniformity in codification of indian laws but specificlly recommended that personal laws of [[hindu]]s & [[muslim]]s should be kept out of such a court, despite introduction of [[a44 Uniform civil code]] into original [[indian constitution]] successive govt have found it difficult to build a consensus on adoption of ucc in  [[india]].
- at same time indian courts have given several important judgments including [[shan bano case]], [[sarala mudgal case 1995]] & triple talaq case in recent times

## arguments in favor of ucc
- 02:17 AM 21/8/2021
- ucc #doubt 
- it would lead to more effective  implementation of laws (because of simplification of laws) _related_ [[gst]] | [[ISO]] | [[]] 
- promote gender equality
- upholding ideals of [[secular]]ism
- will promote national integration
- help in breaking down of boundaries b/w people of diff communities

## arguments against ucc
- 02:22 AM 21/8/2021
- [[uniform civil code]]
- _building a consensus will be challenging_ "india is a nation in making"  _related_ [[_modern history ÂéÜÂè≤ MOC]] | [[]] | [[]] 
- may create apprehensions among minorities
- will interfere with exercise of right to religion
- would disregard rich diverse culture of [[india]]
- may create conflicts in [[society]]
- conclusion regarding ucc
	- ucc is 1 of [[directive principles of state policy]] under [[a44 Uniform civil code]] of [[indian constitution]] [[constitution]] & therefore it should be duty of state to observe it in governance of country. but any such move to implement ucc should only be made after evolving a proper consensus in society.:
	- any such decision should not be taken with haste.
	- govt & [[society]] would need to work harder to build trust as well as to make a common cause with social reformers attached to every community
