- Coal found in India belongs to two geological periods: the [[gondwana]] and the Tertiary. Of the 113 coalfields found in the country, 80 belong to the Lower Gondwana period. These account for over 98% of the total reserves and 99% of the [[production]] of coal in India. The Gondwana coal has carbon [[content]] between 55 and 60 per cent, high volatile matter and ash contents. It is mainly bituminous and [[anthracite]]. While total coal reserves are estimated at 111.83 billion tonnes, total lignite reserves are estimated at 38.93 billion tonnes only.
- The coal is both coking and non-coking. However, non-coking coal comprises lion's share of [[india]]n coal. The estimated reserve of coking coal is about 29.70 billion tonnes while non-coking coal reserves being 166.32 billion tonnes.
