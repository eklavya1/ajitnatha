# doctrine of territorial nexus
[[doctrine of territorial nexus]]
- if there is a sufficient relationship b/w entity that is taxed, or relevant to a state over which law is being made, state laws can be made & applied outside state as well.
- 2 necessary conditions for this-
	- entity must have extraterritorial operations in state.
	- entity & territory of state must have sufficient & valid nexus.
- doctrine is important for taxation issues over entities not located within state but having operations in state.
- reference cases- state of bombay v/s rmdc 1957, tisco v/s state of bihar 1958
- parliament can even make extra-territorial laws. means parliament laws can be made for indian citizens residing or moving abroad.

# article 246 (3:54 pm)
# division of legislative powers b/w centre & states
- power of parliament to make laws on union subjects is over & above power of state legislatures to make laws over concurrent & state list. hence principle of federal supremacy.

# doctrine of pith & substance
[[doctrine of pith and substance]]
- pith- nature, substance- a most essential part.
- it's not possible to place subjects in watertight compartments.
- it's possible that state makes a law that appears to encroach a union subject or if union makes a law that apparently encroaches on a union subject.
- strict interpretation of division of legislative powers will limit legislative powers of both unions & states.
- sc has laid that in such cases, only real subject matter will be challenged, & not its incidental effects over something else.
- doctrine provides a degree to legislature while enacting laws.

# doctrine of colorable legislation
[[doctrine of colorable legislation]]
- what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly too.
- used to judge constitutionality of law when a legislature not having a right to make law over a particular subject indirectly legislates over same in garb of enacting law on its own subject.

# doctrine of repugnancy
[[doctrine of repugnancy]]
- repugnancy here means contradiction when both laws are applied.
- concerned when laws made by centre & states over same subject of concurrent list, but there is a discrepancy over laws, for ex -diff fines over same act.
- normally in such cases, centre law will prevail over state law, until & unless state law has been reserved for president, as per article 254.
- state law will be repugnant as per extent of repugnancy.
- this means state law would not necessarily be totally repugnant, but only provisions which conflict with central law.
- doctrine follows simple premise that- every statute has a purpose & intent as per law & should be read as a whole.
- court will give interpretation that is consistent with all provisions & hence make statute consistent.
- it's held that both laws should be given widest possible interpretation & allowed to coexist until & unless conflicting provisions are so repugnant that no conciliation is possible.

# power of parliament to make laws on state subject
