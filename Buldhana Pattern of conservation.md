- Maharashtra's 'Buldhana Pattern' of water conservation' has won national recognition and the [[niti aayog]] is in the process of formulating National Policy on water conversation based on it.
- The Buldhana pattern is a framework for water conservation used in Buldhana district of Maharashtra in the [[Vidarbha]] region, which faces droughts often.
- In this pattern, the construction of national highways is synchronized with water conservation by using soil from activities like desiltation and water body deepening of [[water]] bodies, nallas and rivers.
- This approach led to the [[increase]] in capacity of water storage across the water-bodies in Buldana district and it came to be known as ‘Buldhana Pattern‘.
- NITI Aayog recently has prepared draft guidelines based on this pattern for convergence of the activities of:
	- sourcing earth for improvement / construction of national highways, state roads and railways and
	- water conservation works through desiltation/ deepening of water bodies.
