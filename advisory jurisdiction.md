The Constitution (Article 143) authorises the president to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court in the two categories of matters:
• On any question of law or fact of public importance which has arisen or which is likely to arise-
• On any dispute arising out of any pre-constitution treaty, agreement, covenant, engagement, sanad or other similar instruments.


An advisory opinion is an opinion issued by a court or a commission like an election commission that does not have the effect of adjudicating a specific legal case, but merely advises on the constitutionality or interpretation of a law.  Some countries have procedures by which the executive or legislative branches may certify important questions to the judiciary and obtain an advisory opinion. In other countries or specific jurisdictions, courts may be prohibited from issuing advisory opinions.
