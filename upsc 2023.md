Here's how one should proceed with their UPSC CSE

preparation for CSE 2023:

1. Phase I- June 2021- December 2021: In this phase, you should start reading one newspaper everyday. For the first few months, it is recommended that you only read through the editorial section of the newspaper. If you're unable to understand the crux of any editorial, you can look it up over the internet and you shall find good explanations for most of your doubts. Youtube too contains a lot of daily news analysis of the Hindu and the Indian Express newspapers. You can decide to religiously follow any of these news analysis videos as well. Simultaneously, following Rajya Sabha TV and Bharata First Channel of Frank Rausan Pareira can be good for building a strong foundation for the preparation that has to follow. In this phase, you can also read through the NCERTs of Science and Social Sciences from Class VI to Class X and History, Geography NCERTs of Class XI and XII.

2. Phase II- January 2022- June 2022- In this phase, you should read the standard books for all the major subjects. Then you should go ahead with making subject wise notes out of the NCERTs that you had read in Phase-I and out of the standard books that you have read in this Phase. Ensure that these notes are short and to the point. They should be in a language which is easily understandable to you and as far as possible, should be prepared digitally so that you can easily edit them whenever required. Since you are giving about 2 years to the preparation, learning how to make effective digital notes is important and will help you in the long run.

3. Phase III- June 2022- December 2022- In this phase, you should revise your optional subject and should practice Mains answer writing thoroughly. As far as possible, making topic wise short notes which align with the Mains syllabus is recommended. You can also refer to the Mains answer copies of past year toppers and can take hints about how to present an answer succinctly. Enrolling in any Mains test series at this point will also be a good idea in order to know about your shortcomings and to improve upon them.

4. Phase IV- Jan 2023- June 2023- The Preliminary Examination is becoming more and more dicey every passing year and thus, the last six month before the commencement of UPSC CSP-2023 can be completely devoted to the Prelims examination. In this phase, you should revise the short notes you'd have made out of NCERTs and Standard books in Phase II of the preparation. You can also enrol in a Prelims test series and follow their schedule with complete dedication. Make notes out the questions you do wrong in these mock tests and also plot your scores on a graph in order to track your progress. Consolidate your current affairs notes of the last 12-15 months and revise them at least twice. For Prelims, it is important that you pay adequate attention to all the subjects in the syllabus and be conceptually sound in the frequently asked concepts.

Following the above schedule is only one way recommended for someone preparing for UPSC CSE 2023. You can modify it as per your own strengths and weaknesses.
