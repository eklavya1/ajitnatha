as per section 15 (1) (a) of sebi fl' regulations, 1995, a foreign institutional investor (fl') could invest in securities in primary secondary markets including shares, debentures, warrants of companies unlisted, listed, or to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in india.
however, subsequent to sebi (fpi) regulations, flls are allowed to invest only in listed or to-be listed entities only through stock exchanges. 
foreign investors investing in initial allotment of shares (say ipos or when a group of entities comes together to float a company) are categorized as fdis, this is a myth.
in fact, fl's are very active in over-the-counter (otc) markets in initial public offering market in india.
consolidated fdi policy of department of industrial policy promotion (dipp) states that 'foreign direct investment, as distinguished from portfolio investment (fll), has connotation of establishing a 'lasting interest' in enterprise that is resident in economy other than that of investot'.
fl' cannot involve in direct management of enterprise. hence statement 3 is not correct.
acc to imf oecd definitions, acquisition of at least ten per cent of ordinary shares or voting power in a public or private enterprise by non-resident investors makes it eligible to be categorized as a foreign direct investment (fdi).
in india, a particular fl' is allowed to invest up to 10% of paid-up capital of a company, which implies that any investment above 10% will be construed as fdi, though officially such a definition did not exist..
it may be noted that there is no minimum amount of capital to be brought in by foreign direct investment to get same categorized as fdi.
