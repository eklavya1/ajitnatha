A big part of the focus on the IMF has been due to the controversy surrounding its Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva's role in the alleged rigging of the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Rankings while she was the chief executive at the Bank.
The IMF has also been in the news for unveiling its second World Economic Outlook (WEO). The IMF comes out with its WEO twice every year (April and October).
On the whole, the IMF's central message was that the global economic recovery momentum had weakened a tad, thanks largely to the 
pandemic-induced supply disruptions across the planet.
But possibly the most important takeaway from the WEO this time is about the employment growth likely to lag the output recovery.
