coal bed methane (cbm), like shale gas, is extracted from what is k/a unconventional gas reservoirs where gas is extracted directly from rock that is source of gas (shale in case of shale gas
and coal in case of cbm).
methane is held underground within coal & is extracted by drilling into coal seam & removing groundwater. resulting drop in pressure causes methane to be released from coal.
acc to directorate general of hydrocarbons, ministry of petroleum & natural gas, india's cbm resources are estimated at around 92 trillion cubic feet (tcf), or 2,600 billion cubic metres (bcm).
countrys coal & cbm reserves are found in 12 states of india, with gondwana sediments of eastem india holding bulk.
damodar koel valley & son valley are prospective areas for cbm development, with cbm projects existing in raniganj south, raniganj east & raniganj north areas in raniganj coalfield, the
parbatpur block in jharia coalfield & east & west bokaro coalfields.
son valley includes sonhat north & sohagpur east & west blocks.

application of cbm:
acc to central mine planning & design institute (cmpdi), cbm can be used for
power generation,
as compressed natural gas (cng) auto fuel,
as feedstock for fertilisers,
industrial uses such as in cement production, rolling mills, steel plants,
for methanol production.
