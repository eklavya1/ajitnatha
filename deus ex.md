**deus ex** is a series of role-playing video games, set during the [[21st century]], focusing on the conflict between secretive factions who wish to control the world by proxy, and the effects of transhumanistic attitudes and technologies in a dystopian future setting featuring references to real-world conspiracy theories, historical mythologies and philosophies and on commentaries of capitalist values and division in society. The first two games in the series were developed by Ion Storm, and subsequent entries were developed by Eidos-Montréal, following Ion Storm's closure. The Ion Storm games were published by Eidos Interactive, and all Eidos-Montréal media was published by Square Enix until [[2022]], when ownership was sold to Embracer Group.

The series consists of six games: Deus Ex ([[2000]]), Deus Ex: Invisible War ([[2003]]), Deus Ex: Human Revolution ([[2011]]), Deus Ex: The Fall ([[2013]]),  Deus Ex Go ([[2016]]) and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (2016). The series has been generally well-received by critics and sold over 14 million units worldwide.
