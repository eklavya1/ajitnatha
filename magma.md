	- magma - mother of all rocks
[[_geography 地理学 MOC]]
- When magma in its upward movement cools and turns into solid form it is called [[igneous 石]]. The process of cooling and solidification can happen in the earth‘s crust or on the surface of the earth.
- As igneous rocks form out of magma and lava from the interior of the earth, they are known as primary rocks. The igneous rocks (Ignis –in Latin - 'Fire') are formed when magma cools and solidifies.
