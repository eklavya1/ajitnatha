[Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials NORM - World Nuclear Association](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/radiation-and-health/naturally-occurring-radioactive-materials-norm.aspx)
from above site
Radioactive materials which occur naturally and where human activities increase the exposure of people to ionising radiation.
NORM results from activities such as burning coal, making and using fertilisers, oil and gas production.
Uranium mining exposes those involved to NORM in the uranium orebody.
Radon in homes is one occurrence of NORM which may give rise to concern and action to control it, by ventilation.
