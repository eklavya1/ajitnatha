World History Class 04

A brief review of the previous class. (1:00 PM)

Napolean:

First Consol ie Head of the State and Austria signs a peace treaty 
1804 - Declared himself as Emperor as he was ambitious and desired legacy 
He invited Pope to validate the crowning and sanctity 
Governance of Napolean:
1801 - Agreement with Church/Pope 
He established a strong central government with a strong bureaucracy 
He established the central bank ie the Back of France 
He built parks, roads, Canals and oversaw Civil Code (1804)
Napolean Code (1804): (1:19 PM)
All male citizens are equal 
Freedom of contract 
Inviolability of private property 
Re-introduced Colonial slavery 
Codified civil and criminal law, etc 
There were three books dealing with persons, things and methods of acquiring things 
The downfall of Napolean:
Continental Blockade of Britain from Europe to trade 
However, British trade was booming - exports of finished goods and importer of raw materials
Spain was attacked as it refrained from the continental blockade 
This impacted the nationalism of Spain and started guerrilla warfare 
Napolean was relying on loot and so Moscow was burned by Russians 
Napoleon was then retreating and was attacked on his return journey 
1813 - Napolean was defeated and was sent to Elba in exile and later sent to Saint Helena where he died 

Analysis of French Revolution: (1:41 PM)

Positives:
Ended feudalism in France 
First republic in Europe - republicanism democracy 
Jacobian constitution 1793 - right to vote and work; right to overthrow 
The goal of the government was the happiness of people 
There was a rise in nationalism in France and the whole of Europe 
Economic - Land redistribution took place; capitalism with the security of property 
Napolean Code - written law for multiple aspects 
Germany and Italian unification 
Anti-colonial struggle in the multi ethic empire in Europe and outside Europe (Simon Bolivar; Haiti; Mexico, Brazil, etc)
Negatives:
France did not become a stable democracy 
The people of France protested as they wanted the right to vote 
France became the second republic under Napolean III
Napoleon became a conqueror from liberator 

Congress of Vienna/Concert of Europe (1815): (2:21 PM)

What:
Concert of Europe was an informal organisation of monarchies of Europe 
It was established by the Congress of Vienna ie a gathering of Monarchies
Context/Why:
After 23 years of devastating wars, the European kingdom wanted peace 
They did not want a repeat of the Empire building as done by Napolean 
Due to the rise of nationalism they had fear of democracy 
Due to the rise of nationalism multi-ethnic empires feared for their territorial integrity as the French revolution gave the nation its modern meaning ie nation is the summation of people who feel one 
And now, there was the demand for ethnicity-based nations 
Result/Decisions of Congress of Vienna:
Such territorial re-distribution was done among major powers so there is the establishment of a balance of power in the European mainland 
For example, Germany was not unified under Prussia as that would have made Prussia too powerful 
Core territories of France were allowed to be retained by France to prevent the weakening of France 
Confederation of Rhine (1806-1813) which was allied to France was ended in 1813 
The resultant 38 German Kingdoms were organised into a German Confederation in 1815 to improve the economy f the region and also to have a strong entity in the neighbourhood of France and Prussia to discourage them from territorial expansion 
Congress of Vienna also created Concert of Europe whose goal/purpose were as follows: (2:45 PM)
Maintain the balance of power in European Mainland ie collectively act against aggressor powers 
For example in 1853, Russia tried to take over the territories of the Ottoman Empire in Europe in the Crimean war (1853-56)
Britain and France sided with Ottomans to defeat Russia to maintain a Balance of power 
To help each other in the separation of public protests for democracy in respective kingdoms 
For example, in 1830, monarchies assisted each other in the separation of public revolts 
Failure of Concert of Europe/Congress of Vienna:
1832 - Greece won independence from Ottoman 
1839 - Belgium won independence from the Netherlands 
In 1848 revolts of people of Europe overcome monarchies
For example in France, 2nd Republic in 1848-52
German kingdoms were forced to settle a Franckfurt National Assembly to draft a constitution for a democratic and united Germany 
In 1870, France became a stable republic by overthrowing Monarchy 
In 1870, there was the unification of Italy and the unification of Germany 
Therefore, the monarchies failed to suppress the spirit of nationalism 
Concert of Europe failed to maintain peace; 1853-56 Crimean war; 1860 - France+Sardinia versus Denmark
1866: Prussia +Italy versus Austria; 1912-13 - Balkan wars; 1914 - World War I 
So, by WW I (1914-19) - The concert of Europe was a dead letter
After the end of WWI, there was a redraw of national boundaries in Europe and many ethnicity-based nations came into existence from multi-ethnic empires as they got disintegrated 

Unification of Germany: (3:02 PM)

Germans were divided into more than 300 kingdoms and in 1806 after defeating Prussia, Napolean organised these German kingdoms (minus Prussia) into a confederation of Rhine 
Therefore Napolean contributed to the process of unification 
In 1815, the Congress of Vienna re-organised these German Kingdoms into a German confederation which also had some territories of Prussia and Austria 
Therefore, GC-1815 was dominated by Prussia, Austria and also Denmark as it claimed some North German territories 
One goal of GC-1815 was economic co-ordination for improving the economy of the region 
1834 Zollverein - a customs union having 18 German states was created by Prussia, therefore a step towards economic unity 
1830 and 1848 Revolts:
In 1830 Germans protested for unified Democratic Germany but failed 
However, in the 1848 revolts, they were successful enforcing the German kings to set up a constituent assembly called Frankfurt National Assembly (FNA)
FNA had representatives of German Kingdoms, Prussia, Austria and representatives of people 
Purpose of determining boundaries of a unified Germany ie whether unified Germany should include or not German populated territory of Austrian Empire ie whether to have  Greater Germany or not 
Draft a constitution for democratic Germany 
In 1849, FNA proposed, a constitutional monarchy for unified Germany under Prussian Monarchy (ie not Greater Germany as Austria opposed it due to potential loss of territory)
Kaiser rejected the constitution proposed and now monarchies bounded back and disbanded the FNA 
Therefore there was a failure to unite as a democracy 

Unification Under Bismark - Policy of Blood and Iron: (3:35 PM)

Bismark was born in a family of nobility/Junkers in 1815
A very able administrator and statesman 
Represented Prussia in FNA - 1848 and 1849
1851 to 1859 - Represented Prussia in GC 1815
1859-62 - As ambassador to France and Russia tried to convince them for a united Germany under Prussia 
1862 - Chosen as Minister-President and Foreign President by Kaiser Wilhelm I
Responsible for laying the foundation of the modern military of Prussia and later Germany 
Kaiser Wilhelm-I wanted modernisation of army/military but Parliament was opposing the passing of budget for same
In 1848 due to public protests, a weak parliament was set up in Prussia 
It was Bismark who convinced the Parliamentarians and gave his famous "Blood and Iron Speech" where he argued that the German question won't be solved by majority decisions and speeches and FNA was a mistake 
It will be solved by a policy of blood and iron ie by sacrifice and war victories 
Therefore he meant if Germany is to be united then Prussia needs to have a modern military 
German railways were also developed and this helped in an  efficient movement of armies and supplies 
Prussia was also gaining monetary strength example via custom union and attempts at industrialisation 
Bismark now had a goal of ending the German Confederation so he is able to annex the German kingdom into Prussia but for this Denmark and Austria had to be removed from GC
1864 - Prussia allied with Austria and defeated Denmark as it was threatening to annex Schleswig and Holstein 
Schleswig was annexed by Prussia and Holstein by Austria; Denmark was removed from GC-1815
1866 - Prussia allied with the Kingdom of Italy and defeated Austria 
Austria was removed from GC-1815; GC-1815 was disbanded in 1866 and northern German kingdoms were annexed by Prussia forming the North German Confederation 1867
Austria was removed from Venetia which was added to the kingdom of Italy furthering the process of unification of Italy 
1870 - Prussia fought and defeated France in the Franco-Prussian war 
Prussia wanted to force Southern German Kingdoms to submit who are confident that France would not allow territorial expansion by Prussia in its neighbourhood 
Napolean-III also wanted a war victory against Prussia:
To prevent the unification of Germany 
To distract the French masses who were again protesting for a republic
Increase his popularity via a war victory 
Result:
Unification of Germany was now completed as southern German kingdoms were annexed 
Prussia annexed coals rich Alsace-Lorraine of France 
Napoleon III was overthrown and the 3rd Republic established in France
