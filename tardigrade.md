tardigrades are found in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments from the arctic to the antarctic, including great depths and altitudes.
they can withstand extreme radiation, sizzling heat, the coldest temperatures of the universe, and decades without food.
also known as water bears or moss piglets, they are capable of surviving temperatures as high as 1500 celsius and as low as minus 2720 celsius albeit for a few minutes.
the grub-like, eight-legged animals can come back from being dried out to a lifeless husk for decades, withstand near zero pressure in outer space the crushing depths of the mariana trench.
they are microscopic, multicellular, and one of the most durable forms of life on planet earth.
