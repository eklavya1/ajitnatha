- The **Bosporus** () or Bosphorus (; Ancient Greek: Βόσπορος Bosporos [bós.po.ros]; Turkish: İstanbul Boğazı 'Istanbul strait', colloquially Boğaz), is a narrow, natural strait and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern Turkey. It forms part of the continental boundary between [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], and divides [[Turkey]] by separating [[Anatolia]] from [[Thrace]]. It is the world's narrowest strait used for international navigation.
- The Bosporus connects the Black Sea with the [[Sea of Marmara]] and, by extension via the Dardanelles, the Aegean and Mediterranean seas, and by the Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov.
- Most of the shores of the strait, except for those in the north, are heavily settled, straddled by the city of Istanbul's metropolitan population of 17 million inhabitants extending inland from both coasts.
- The Bosporus and the [[Dardanelles strait]] are known as the Turkish Straits.
