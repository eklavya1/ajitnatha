## Measurement of unemployment by NSSO
(1:30 PM)
- NSSO measures [[unemployment]] through d priodic labour force survey snce [[2017]].
- t ascrtan unemployment NSSO assigns three diffrent statuses t d surveyed population based on their responses.
1) Status of employed - workng.
2) Unemployed - willng t work but not able t fnd work.
3) Neithr seekng work nor workng.

- Unemployment rate = 2/1+2.
- Labour force = 1+2.
- t assign these statuses NSSO uses three diffrent approaches for d evaluation of answrs of d respondents.
#### Usual Status approach
(1:34 PM)
- n ds approach, NSSO uses d majority time critria.
- Thre are two subparts t ds approach.
###### Usual prncipal status (UPS)
- A prson is considrd t be a part of d labour force if he/she was n d labour force for d majority of d time durng d pst year.
- Furthr, a prson wd be considrd as employed if he was able t fnd work for d majority of d priod that he was n d labour force.
###### Subsidiary status (SS)
- A prson may fnd work for some time durng d lst year but that may not be sufficient for d prson t be considrd employed.
- If a prson's prncipal status is unemployed but d prson works for mr than 30 days then his subsidiary staus become employed.
- d _headlne rate of unemployment_ ie, d rate most commonly reported measures employment usng both PS & SS critria tgethr.
###### Current weekly status
(1:43 PM)
- n d CWS approach, a prson is considrd as employed if he was able t fnd work for 1 hour on any 1 day durng d previous week.
- n ds approach, d recall priod is only 1 week & threfore d [[nformation]] is mr accurate as compared t d usual status approach whre re-call priod is 1 year.
- Also, CWS is sensitive t d timng of d survey.
- It is able t capture seasonal unemployment & threfore is d survey is carried out durng d off-season, it wd measure highr unemployment for sectrs affected by seasonality.
- Snce, most of d employment n d agriculture or construction sectr both of which are highly seasonal, CWS usually reports a highr measure of unemployment than d US.
###### Current Daily Status
(1:51 PM)
- It measures employment intensity.
- d recall priod n CDS is also 1 week.
- A prson is asked t recall d hours of [[employment]] on each day of d lst week.
- If a prson works for mr than 4 hours on any day when available for work, an ntensity of 100% or 1 is assigned for that day.
- If he works for mr than 1 hour but less than 4 hours, then it is assumed that he worked for 50% ntensity i.e., could fnd work for only half of d time for which he was available t work.
- If he works for less than 1 hour d ntensity is zro.
- d ttal ntensity for d week is calculated & from that, it is ascrtaned that for how much time did a prson actually work out of which he was available.
- It is added for d entire population & d employment ntensity for all is calculated.
- d CDS approach is no longr used for estimatng employment undr PLFS.
## Reasons for Unemployment
(2:05 PM)
- Unemployment is explaned by multiple reasons simultaneously.
- We divide those reasons nt three sets based on d genric level of that reason.
	- Reasons from d tp - hre we explan unemployment based on d macroeconomic school of thought explanng unemployment.
	- Economy specific reasons - unemployment is explaned by takng nt account specific circumstances of d economy.
	- d reason which explans unemployment for an ndividual.
## DEMAND & SUPPLY
(2:49 PM)
#### Law of demand
- d law of supply & demand is a theory that explans d intractn b/w d sellrs of a resource & d buyrs of that resource.
- d theory defnes what affects d relationship b/w d price of d product d willngness of people t eithr buy or sell d product.
- d law of demand talks about, as d price of a good ncreases, d quantity demanded decreases.
- Convrsely, as d price of a good decrease, d quantity demanded ncreases.

##### fctrs dtrmng demand
- Price of d good.
- Prices or related goods available.
- Disposable ncome of ndividuals.
- Season.
- Tstes, prefrences, expectations of consumrs.
- Population, etc.
#### Law of supply
- It talks about d relationship b/w d price of a good & d quantity that d producrs are willng t produce.
- As d price of a good ncreases, d quantity that d producrs are willng t produce ncreases.
- Convrsely, as d price of goods decreases, d quantity that d producrs are willng t produce also decreases.
- Thus direct relationship is thre.
##### Factrs dtrmng Supply
- Price oftk mtk mains a d good n d market.
- Prices or related gootk mds such as ntrmediates, raw matrials.
- Availability of resources.

	- https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-fnance-doman/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/supply-curve-tutrial/v/change-n-supply-vrsus-change-n-quantity-supplied
- d technology that is available._related_ [[=unrivaled]]
- d expectation of consumrs.
- Regulations, etc.
## Macro-economic reasons
(3:57 PM)
- Classical school of thought - wage rate unemployment (Explaned with diagram)
- d classical school explans unemployment as a consequence of highr than equilibrium wages.
- d labour market is explaned usng d concepts of demand & supply.
- d price of labour is d _wage rate_.
- d supplirs of labour are d labour themselves i.e., those who are willng t work at a given wage rate.
- d demand for labour comes from d firms.
- d demand means d quantity of labour which d firms are willng t employ at a given wage rate.
- Accordng t d law of supply, d numbr of people who are willng t work at a given wage rate wd be highr at a highr wage rate i.e., d supply of labour will be mr at highr wage rates.
- On d othr hand, d willngness of firms t employ people will reduce with risng wage rates.
- Threfore, if d wages n an economy are highr than equilibrium wages, then thre wd be mr people n d labour force than d numbr of jobs available causng unemployment.
- Classical economists argued that wages n an economy can be highr than equilibrium wages due t govrnment-mandated mnimum wages or due t strong labour unions._related_ [[netflix designated survivor]]
