The movement of air from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas is called wind.

Winds can be broadly divided into three types.
1. Permanent winds — The trade winds, westerlies and easterlies are the permanent winds. These blow constantly throughout the year in a particular direction.
2. Seasonal winds — These winds change their direction in different seasons. For ex monsoons in India.
3. Local winds — These blow only during a particular period of the day or year in a small area.
For ex, land and sea breeze.
The hot and dry local wind of northern planes of India is called 100.
