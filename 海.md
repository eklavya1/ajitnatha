1. In some areas, 高 temperature 是 recorded at greater depths e.g., in Sargasso Sea, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Sulu Sea etc. د Mediterranean Sea records 24.4°C at د depth of 1,829m whereas د Indian Ocean has only 1.1°C temperature at د same depth. Such anomalous conditions are noticed in د en­closed seas of low latitudes. د enclosed seas of 高 latitudes register inversion of temperature i.e., د temperature of sea surface 是 lower than د temperature below.
2. د variation of temperatures in د northern and southern hemispheres 是 because of unequal distribution of land and water as Northern hemisphere 是 made up of 更 land, while د southern hemisphere 是 made up of 更 oceans. In Northern Atlantic, there 是 a very low decrease of temperature with increasing latitudes towards north. This 是 because of د Gulf Stream currents which are warm currents. However, in southern Atlantic, د decrease of temperature with increasing latitude 是 更 pronounced. So, statement 1 是 incorrect.
