Agasthyamala- plant Agasthyapacha
It leads to a stamina booster (immunity).
A team of scientists led by Dr. Pushpagandhan.
People of the Kani tribe were deployed to carry out the work but they were not tired as they take the plant.

Kani tribe gets part of the profit.

Dictation (1.40 PM)

This Act was enacted by the central government to fulfill 3 objectives of the UNCBD.
This law provides institutional mechanisms at the center, state, and local levels to conserve biodiversity, sustainably use genetic resources and provide benefit sharing to stakeholders who provide such resources.
National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)
Expert members
Role/ functions- advisory role, regulatory role, facilitative role.
State Biodiversity Board (SBB)
Expert members

The NBA helps in formulating policies and programs for the conservation of biodiversity in the country.
It also formulates National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP).
- NBA declares Biodiversity Heritage Sites which are rich in biodiversity and existing for a long time. Eg- Maujuli Island
NBA, being a statutory body, regulates the use of genetic resources in the country.
A company or individual requires prior approval from the NBA to use any biological resource for market purposes.
NBA also helps in the implementation of the access and benefit-sharing (ABS) agreement in the country.
As per the law, an IPR holder has to disclose the source of origin of biological resources to the NBA which fixes a royalty to be paid by the IPR holder.
It prevents bio-piracy in the country.

## People‚Äôs Biodiversity Register (PBR)
Local flora and fauna
Traditional knowledge of the area
Landscape: eg- Hilly area, coastal area, etc.
Agro-climatic zone.
PBR helps in the conservation of species at the local level.

The benefits given to the local communities are shared by the BMC.
