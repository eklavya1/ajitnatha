Science and Technology ( ABH ) 11

Application of Communication Satellites (1:12 PM)

Radio, Television, Education, medical assistance.
Tele-education: 
ISRO has a dedicated program called EduSAT, through Doordarshan, etc.
EduSAT Programme includes TV Broadcast, Video Conferencing, for educational purposes.
Tele-medicine: 
Connect remote and rural medical colleges and hospitals to major hospitals in cities via satellites.

VSAT: Very Small Aperture Terminal: 

To support applications with video, voice, and data, VSATs are used.
These are small satellite earth stations that transmit and receive data via satellites. 
Applications: ATMs operate because of VSAT satellites.
Similarly, Stock Markets use VSAT, Indian Railways also use VSAT of ISRO.

Village Resource Center (ISRO initiative):

ISRO provides tele-education, telemedicine, Panchayat Planning, vocational training, weather information, etc. to a few panchayats.
Service is provided to about 430 villages.
In collaboration with SHGs in certain villages.

COSPAS SARSAT: 

Intergovernmental Programme.
It is a satellite-aided, search and rescue plan.
In this emergency, beacons are activated by aircraft, ships, and people, who are lost.
It requires GPS and communication satellites.

Indian Data Relay Satellite System: 

ISRO is planning to launch data relay satellites.
To provide for enhanced security and reduce dependence on ground stations.
This will be known as Indian Data Relay Satellite System (IDRSS)

Earth Observation Satellite: (1:38 PM)

They are also known as Remote Sensing satellites.
They can monitor: 
Moisture, desertification, loss of water resources, etc.
It can be helpful in disaster management, weather information.

Remote sensing uses: (1:48 PM)

These satellites are specifically designed for earth observation.
They are used in environmental assessment, meteorology, map making, resource management, among many other areas.
They have various applications: 
Soil monitoring, Potential of renewable energy mapping, forest management, geology and geomorphology, Ocean science, disaster management, weather information and climate modeling, management of water resources. 
Rural and urban development, schemes such as Clean Ganga, Housing projects, MGNREGA.
EOS 01, RISAT 2B-R1, CARTOSAT 3, HysiS are some of the latest remote sensing satellites of ISRO.
These are placed in Low Earth Orbits, Polar orbits, and sometimes in Geo-synchronous orbits.
Some of the most famous remote sensing techniques are: 
Synthetic Aperture Radar, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Hyperspectral Imaging.

GISAT-1 (2:04 PM)

This launch has failed.
GISAT was earth observation, remote sensing satellite.
It was to be launched via GSLV MK-II.

NISAR Mission: 

NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar.
For environmental monitoring and hazard monitoring.
It will be launched in low earth orbit.
It will use dual-frequency L band and S-band radar missions.
It will study ecosystem disturbances, ice-sheet collapse, natural hazards, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and landslides.

Navigational Satellites: (2:32 PM)

These satellites allow small electronic receivers to determine their location, longitude, latitude, and altitude to high precision.
For example, GPS which is of the USA, Glonass which is of Russia, Galileo, which is of Europe, Beidou which is of China, and NAVIC of India (NAVIC is a regional system, while the other four are global).
These satellites can be used for the following applications: 
Terrestrial, aerial, and marine navigation.
Vehicle tracking, integration with mobile phones, disaster management, mapping
These satellites provide two types of services:
Standard services for civilian use,
And Restricted services for military and intelligence officials, who have proper authentication.

NaVIC (2:46 PM)

Navigation of Indian Constellation.
It is an independent regional navigational satellite system developed by India.
It can provide navigational services, over India and its neighborhood. (1500 km beyond Indian borders). 
It consists of seven IRNSS satellites (3 in Geostationary and 4 in Geosynchronous).
NaVIC consists of 7 satellites, GPS has 32 satellites.
NaVIC is regional, 1500 km, GPS is a global system.
NaVIC is kept in Geosynchronous/Geostationary, GPS satellites are in medium earth (20,,000 km).
NaVIC is low cost, GPS is the high cost (high annual maintenance cost of GPS).

GAGAN (GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation): 

It is a collaboration between ISRO and the Airport Authority of India (AAI).
It aims to provide satellite-based aviation applications.
GAGAN will improve Air Traffic Management over Indian Airspace.

GEMINI: (2:57 PM)

Gagan Enabled Marinerâ€™s Instrument for Navigation and Information (GEMINI) device.
It will be fitted to fishing boats.
Servers in INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services, under Ministry of Earth Sciences.
It will help in: disaster warnings, potential fishing zones, ocean forecasts, etc.

Space Science: (3:01 PM)

Chandrayaan 2: 
It had Orbiter, Lander (Vikram), and Rover (Pragyan), it was launched using GSLV MK III.
Chandrayaan 1: Detected water, confirmed magma ocean hypothesis, spinel rich rocks on the moon.
South Pole of Moon is important because: It may have water, fossil records of the early solar system, untapped resources, etc.

Gaganyaan: (3:31 PM)

Is managed by Gaganyaan National Advisory Council.
Precursor missions to Gaganyaan: 
Space Capsule Recovery Experiment.
Crew module Atmospheric Reentry Experiment (CARE-2014)
Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD).
Gaganyaan has been supported by France and Russia.
3 people for 7 days are planned.
If successful- India will be 4th country after USSR, USA, and China.

The topic for the Next class: Aditya L1, Launch vehicles, Space debris, etc.
