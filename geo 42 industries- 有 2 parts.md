# manufacturing industries
(1.16 pm)
- manufacturing means "made by hand" 手 esp before industrial revolution.
- it's production of identical goods on large scale using raw material, machinery, power, & specialized labor in a factory setting. 
- manufacturing produces standardized commodities.
- locational factors:
	- they are factors that decide location of industry in a particular region.
	- locational factor aims to reduce cost of production.
	- traditional locational factor: raw material, markets, & labor.
	- weight losing raw material: raw material that loses weight during process of manufacturing. for ex sugarcane. #imp 
	- non-weight for raw material: raw material that doesn't lose weight during process of manufacturing. for ex cotton.

various locational factors are:
	raw-material:
	easy availability of raw material.
	cost of raw material
	`weight losing raw material or not.`
	perishable raw material.

labor:
	availability of labor.
	cost of labor.
	need of skilled or unskilled labor.
market:
	size of market (level of demand).
	competition in market.
	distance of market from industries.
energy: [[e=e]]
	availability on regular basis.
	cost of electricity.
	transportation:
	faster modes of transportation.
	cheaper transport.
capital:
	easy availability of capital.
	early industries came up around calcutta due to availability of capital by british.
govt policies:
	various support & incentives provided by govt can boost industries in a region, for ex, it industry in bangalore.

# footloose industry
(1.50 pm)
 - 07:39 pm 13/10/2021 _related_ [[knowledge - its creation, distribution & economic significance]] [[globalisation]] [[united states of america]] 
- industry that in not depend on a specific raw material & can be obtained from anywhere.
- location of these industries is majorly decided by govt policies.
- for ex, it industries were supported by policies of karnataka govt.

# cotton textile industry
(1.58 pm)
	- significance: it's largest agro-based industry in india in terms of people employed.
	- various locational factors for cotton textile industry:
		- as it's a non-weight losing industry, thus not dependent on location of raw material that much.
		- initially, it was located in western part (gujrat & maharastra) of india due to easy availably of capital.
		- market is most dominant factor at present due to changing nature of fashion & demand.
		- transportation is another major factor in location of cotton textile industry.

- distribution in india:
	- in bombay & gujarat in initial phase of industry.
	- after independence major good-quality cotton-producing regions went to pakistan thus india started growing cotton in black soil regions.
	- traditional center: surat, bombay, nasik, pune, jamnagar, aurangabad, ahmedabad(manchester of india).
	- later shift in cotton textile:

- toward south:
	- esp in coimbatore (manchester of south india)
	- reasons: black soil, cheap power, labor, port facility provided by chennai & cochin ports.
	- toward north:
	- in regions of up, bihar, mp, west bengal, etc.
	- majorly due to higher market demand due to population & cheap labor.

major challenges for cotton textile industry:
	indian cotton quality is not very superior.
	there is no regular supply of raw cotton.
	irregularity & high cost of power supply.
	old & outdated machinery.
	completion in international markets from bangladesh & vietnam.
	at world level:
	largest producers: egypt, usa, china, uzbekistan.
	major importer: europe

# jute-textile industry
(2.23 pm)

- majorly regions in india: west bengal & assam.

- locational factors:
	- raw material is most dominating factor as it's not easily available even when it's a non-weight losing industry.
	- power is important factor as jute mills require regular & cheap electricity.
	- it also requires water supply on a large scale.
	- need cheaper & larger availability of labor.

- distribution:
	- rishra was *1st jute industry* by british in [[1855]].
	- it was initially set up in bengal in region of rishra, kolkata, howrah, etc.
	- after independence major jute growing region went to east pakistan, thus jute production was boosted in west bengal, assam, & north orissa.
	- over period of time jute making industries were set in up, bihar, mp, & andhra pradesh due to increasing demand for jute textile in these regions.
- problems associated with jute industries:
	- raw material: low quality & supply.
	- old & outdated technology thus increases cost of production.
	- tough competition from bangladesh.
	- plastic is a major disrupter for jute bag demand. _related_ [[=how to hide empire#^69461a]]   
- labour: frequent lockout & strike in west bengal region.
- significance:
	- ==jute is c/a "golden fiber".== #pre 
	- cheap & can be alternative to plastic.
	- eco-friendly in nature.

# silk-textile industry
(2.42 pm)
- [[silk]] [[silk route]]
- it's a very fine textile & among oldest fiber
- major location factor is raw material.
- it's processed by silk cocoon.

- there are 5 varieties of silk: #pneumonic _memto_ #pre 
	- mulberry silk: more than 50% of total silk production in india, mainly in south india esp in karnataka. 
	- erie silk: mainly in west bengal.
	- moga silk: mainly in assam.
	- tropical tsar: mainly in jharkhand, orissa, chhattisgarh.
	- oak tsar: mainly in  up & bihar.
- `india is only country where all 5 varieties of silk are produced.` #imp 

`sericulture`
(silk production): _related_ [[silk route]] [[marco polo]] [[medici]] 
significances:
	- very good sources of alternative income for farmers.
	- wasteland & dry can be used for production of silk.
	- it can boost women's empowerment in rural india.

# sugar industry
(3.10 pm)
- it's 2nd largest agro-based industry after textile industry.
- it's mostly located near sugarcane producing regions as:
- most important locational factor is raw material as it loses weight by 1/10th.
- it's very bulky to transport.
- [[sucrose]] content loses with time.

*distribution*:
- initially, it was set up in up, haryana, punjab, & northern bihar.
- now more than 50% of sugar is produced in southern part of india esp in maharashtra, karnataka, tamil nadu, & andhra pradesh
- this is mainly due to:
	- sugarcane in south had more sucrose content as compared to northern region due to marine impact.
	- crushing season is more in south in india.
	- cooperative played a crucial role in south india while in north industries were established by individuals.
- problems faced by industry:
	- price: mrp-based govt control of price.
	- low productivity.
	- irregular availability of sugarcane.
	- low technology up-gradation.
	- high competition from [[brazil]]. _related_ [[brazilian current]] [[ocean currents]] [[mba]] 
	- there is also completion from gur & khandsari (local varieties of sugar).

# iron & steel
(3.31 pm)

significance: it's fundamental industry for all other industries. _related_ [[pareto principle]]   
locational factors:
raw material:
	pig iron is 100% iron & is very brittle.
pig iron is made by adding iron ore+coal & limestone.
	- *why britain industrialized 1st ?*
	- note - [[britain]] had huge coal reserves + [[warm oceanic currents]] + good navy + iron reserves + huge network of inland [[river]]s
	- indented coastline with sheltered bays
	- all navigable rivers of england flow into [[sea]]
	- good [[transportation]]ort network
	- availability of [[labor]] _related_ [[4 factors of production#^5afb08]]   
	- [[bank]]s
	- plenty of [[coal]] & [[iron]]
	- [[geo 28#^fc8a92]] ^54d667

[[steel]] is made by adding [[manganese]] to [[pig iron]].
it requires a huge quantity of [[water]].
overall steel that is produced loses weight by 1/3rd.
it consumes [[power]] in very large quantity thus need a constant & cheap supply of power.

distribution in india: there are 10 integrated(installed on a huge scale) [[steel]] plants in [[india]]:
	[[jharkhand]]: ist plant was established in jamshedpur, another 1 at bokaro.
	[[west bengal]]: durgapur & burnpur.
	[[odisha]]: rourkela
	[[chattishgarh]]: bhilai
	[[karnataka]]: bhadravati & vijayanagar steel plant.
	[[andhra pradesh]]: vizag steel plant.
	[[tamil nadu]]: salem steel plant. ^5138c7

*distribution in world*:
	usa(pittsburgh, rust belt), russia, uk, germany(ruhr valley), china, etc.
	locational factors are same as in india.

*problem with iron & steel industry in india*:
	it requires huge capital investment.
	gestation period is very large.
	issue of irregular power supply.
	low [[technology]] up-gradation.
	competition from cheap [[import]]s. _related_ [[export]] [[_economics 经济 moc]] [[=utopia for realists]] 

*mini-steel plants*:
	these are steel plants that are located away from source of raw material.
	they require lesser investment & capital.
	they use scrap iron as a raw material.
	located near to city center & fulfill local demands.
	they also have a small gestation period.
	however, they also have issues of irregularity of iron scrap & power supply.

# fertilizer industry
(4.00 pm):

significance-
	provide important raw materials for [[agriculture]].
	india is not self-sufficient in fertilizers & imports a large part of fertilizers.
	important raw materials used are:

[[naphtha]]:
	it's derived from petroleum refineries as a by-product of [[petroleum]]. thus industries are located near refineries.
	it's mainly used for [[production]] of [[nitrogen]]ous [[fertilizer]]s.
	major of naphtha is also imported thus industries are also located in coastal region.

ammonium sulfate:
	it's used for making nitrogenous fertilizers.
	mainly in gujrat, rajasthan, andhra pradesh, & tamil nadu.

rock phosphate:
it's used in phosphatic fertilizers.
it's mainly available in rajasthan, jharkhand, & andra pradesh, thus industries in these states.
it's also imported in large quantity so industries are also located near coastal regions.

sulphuric acid:
it comes from petroleum refineries, thus industries located near refineries.

# pharmaceutical industry
(4.11 pm):
it's a [[footloose industry]].
india is dependent on [[china]] for api used as raw material.

# agro-processing industry
(4.16 pm)
it processes agricultural produce into semi-processed or fully processed goods.
it's mainly located around [[agriculture]] [[production]] areas.

*regional resource-based manufacturing*
(4.20 pm)
	it's based on using locally available materials for manufacturing.
	advantage: self-sufficiency, cheap labor, etc.
	issues: may create regional imbalance, low diversity, etc.

# industrial regions
(4.24 pm)
	it's a region with multiple advantages for setting multiple industries.
	india has 6 major industrial regions:
			[[hooghly]] industrial belt.
			mumbai-[[pune]] industrial region.
			[[ahmedabad]]-vadodara region.
			madurai-coimbatore-bengaluru region.
			chhotanagpur plateau region.
			agra-mathura-meerut-delhi belt.

# transportation
(4.26 pm)
it includes [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, waterways (inland & coastal), & airways.

inland waterways:
	it's waterways using rivers, canals, etc for [[transportation]].
[[india]] has huge potential for inland waterways.
*advantages*:
	it's cheapest all mode of transport.
	it has very little energy consumption.
	it's eco-friendly & caused very less pollution.
	labor intensive thus good employment opportunity.
	low cost of maintenance.
*issues*: _related_ [[prisoners of geography]] [[=unrivaled]]  
	slower than other modes thus cannot be used for perishable goods.
	seasonal nature of rivers.
	construction of hydropower projects & dams has reduced river water.
	landscape not navigable for all places.
	siltation in [[river]]s.
	dependent on other modes.
	shifting river courses.
	very less [[investment]] after [[independence]].
	there are 5 major waterways in india & 106 new waterways were added recently.

# assignment
- discuss factors that determine location of industries by providing suitable exs. (10 marks / 150 words) (10 marks)
# ******************************
# class 42 part 2
# human geography

- [[population]]- all aspects of population; idea of migration; diff theories of population pyramids;
- tribes- try to cover through mapping
- census [[2021]] (will cover in current next year)
# population
(5:15 pm)
- terms related to population-
	- crude/arithmetic density- _total population / total area_
		- metropolitan cities have a higher arithmetic density
	- nutritional density- _total population / total cultivable land_
	- agriculture density- _agricultural population / total cultivable land_
# growth
- (5:22pm)
- natural growth rate= total live births-total deaths/population ×1000
- crude birth rate= number of live births in a year divided by total midyear population with ratio multiplied by 1000
- fertility rate= fertility rate is defined as number of live births per thousand women in age group (15-49 years) in a given year.
- replacement level fertility- level of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from 1 generation to next.
- average number of children women would need to have to reproduce herself by bearing a daughter who survives to childbearing age so that each generation will exactly replace itself without considering migration.
- total fertility levels of about 2.1 children per woman.
- crude death rate- annual number of deaths per 1,000 people. 
- imr- infant mortality rate is number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live births.
- mmr- mmr is defined as number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 1,00,000 live births during same period. 
# migration
(5:43 pm)
- anyone who changes their residence for a substantial duration of time.
- migration types - domestic & international
- domestic migration we have 4 types-
	- rural to urban -people who come to urban a from rural areas in terms of better living, better employment; better education
	- urban to urban- (small cities to big cities)- for better opportunities; better health facilities
	- urban to rural- ex- work from home (during covid-19); after retirement culture
	- rural to rural- ex-marriage; agriculture
- international migration - voluntary migration (ex-brain drain)and forced migration (ex-refugees,war,conflict)
- causes of migration - can be due to -
	- push factor & pull factor
- pull factor- education, health, infrastructure, etc
- push factor - war, conflicts, disasters, etc.
# population pyramids
(5:57 pm)
- graphical representation of population composition of a country is c/a a population pyramid.
- population is divided into 2 sides- right side (male) & left side (females) #doubt
- we represent them as per diff age groups
- shape of population pyramid reflects characteristics of population & also indicates whether population is experiencing growth or decline or stability.
- population pyramid shows- sex ratio; population in each particular age group; birth & death rate.
- on shape of population, we have diff types of pyramids-
	- progressive - very high birth rate & high death rate but stillbirth rate is very high than death rate. you see a younger population here.
	- stationary - here you observe birth rate is almost equal to death rate. number of people who are being born, almost same amount of people dying
	- regressive - when birth rate is very low & death rate is also low. but birth rate is less than death rate.
******************************************
# population theories
(6:10pm)
## malthus theory
- says population of any country increases in geometric progression whereas resources increases in arithmetic progression.
- it predicts that after a certain period of growth there would be a huge gap b/w population & resources. resources would not be sufficient & population will collapse. _related_ [[great levellers book]]  
 
## demographic transition
- demographic transition theory - dtt _related_ [[fertilizer]] [[diclofenac]] [[vulture]] 
- demographic transition theory by _thompson & notestein_ #pre 
- dtt- countries death rate & birth rate goes through diff stages
- initially, there will be a very high birth rate & death rate resulting in a contracting population.
- then death rates decreases & birth rate is still high- population increases
- after some period birth rate starts decreasing -pyramid starts to achieve stationary
- low birth rate & low death rate leads to stabilization.
- after that population remains constant.
- after that both fertility & mortality decline considerably. population is either stable or grows slowly.
- if birth rate becomes lesser than death rate-total population starts decreasing.
- it studies relationship b/w economic development & population growth
# settlements
- (7:01pm)
- dispersed settlement
- compact settlement
- fragmented or nucleated
# various terms
- metropolis- diff levels of development-
- eopolis (early development stage)
- polis (developed city)
- metropolis (well-developed city with many of satellite city- would have suburbs)
- megalopolis( merging of multiple metropolis)
- conurbation(multiple cities in straight lines)-eastern usa _related_ [[trellis pattern]]   
- tyranopolis (growth when it reaches at its peak it started declining) _related_ [[plato]] #peak 
- nekropolis (dead city) _related_ [[indus valley civilization]]
