- taxila (also known as thakshashila; punjabi and urdu: ٹيکسلا; from pāli brahmi: 𑀢𑀔𑁆𑀔𑀲𑀺𑀮𑀸, takhkhasilā, sanskrit: तक्षशिला, iast: takṣaśilā, meaning "cloven rock") is a city in the taxila tehsil of rawalpindi district, punjab, pakistan. it lies about 25 km (16 mi) northwest of rawalpindi-islamabad and is just south of haripur district, [[khyber pakhtunkhwa]].

old taxila was an important city of ancient india, situated at the pivotal junction of the indian subcontinent and central asia on the eastern shore of the indus river. it was founded around 1000 bce. some ruins at taxila date to the time of the achaemenid empire in the 6th century bce, followed successively by the mauryan empire, indo-greek, indo-scythian, and kushan empire periods. owing to its strategic location, taxila has changed hands many times over the centuries, with many empires vying for its control. when the great ancient trade routes connecting these regions ceased to be important, the city sank into insignificance and was finally destroyed by the nomadic hunas in the 5th century. the renowned archaeologist sir alexander cunningham rediscovered the ruins of taxila in the mid-19th century. in 1980, taxila was declared a unesco world heritage site.by some accounts, the university of ancient taxila was considered to be one of the earliest universities in the world. others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in taxila, in contrast to the later nalanda university in eastern india. in a 2010 report, global heritage fund identified taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites most "on the verge" of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and war and conflict as primary threats. however, significant preservation efforts have been carried out since then by the government which have resulted in the site being declared as "well-preserved" by different international publications. because of the extensive preservation efforts and upkeep, the site is a popular tourist spot, attracting up to one million tourists every year.
