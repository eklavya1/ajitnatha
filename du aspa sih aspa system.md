[[Jahangir]] introduced the Duh-Aspah Sih-Aspah system.
It is a system whereby the selected nobles could be allowed to maintain a larger quota of troopers, without raising their Zat rank.
The system was popular as 'du-aspah' (a trooper with two horses) or 'sih-aspah' (a trooper with three horses) system.
This was the du-aspah sih-aspah system which implied that a mansabdar holding this -rank had maintained and was paid for double the quota of troopers indicated by his sawar rank.
Thus, a mansabdar holding a zat rank of 3000, and 3000 sawars du-aspah sih-aspah would be required to maintain 6000 troopers
