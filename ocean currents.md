- An ocean current is a continuous, directed movement of sea water generated by a number of forces acting upon the water, including wind, the Coriolis effect, breaking waves, cabbeling, and temperature and salinity differences. Depth contours, shoreline configurations, and interactions with other currents influence a current's direction and strength. Ocean currents are primarily horizontal water movements.
- An ocean current flows for great distances and together they create the global conveyor belt, which plays a dominant role in determining the climate of many of Earth’s regions. More specifically, ocean currents influence the temperature of the regions through which they travel.  For example, warm currents traveling along more temperate coasts increase the temperature of the area by warming the sea breezes that blow over them.  Perhaps the most striking example is the Gulf Stream, which makes northwest Europe much more temperate than any other region at the same latitude. Another example is Lima, Peru, where the climate is cooler, being sub-tropical, than the tropical latitudes in which the area is located, due to the effect of the Humboldt Current. Ocean currents are patterns of water movement that influence climate zones and weather patterns around the world. They’re primarily driven by winds and by seawater density, although many other factors – including the shape and configuration of the ocean basin they flow through – influence them. The two basic types of currents – surface and deep-water currents – help define the character and flow of ocean waters across the planet.

ocean current is a continuous general movement of ocean water in a specific direction.
about 10% of water in world's ocean is involved in surface currents.
most surface currents move water in horizontal and vertical direction in top layer above thermocline (  layer where temperature changes steeply).
water beneath thermocline also circulates but movement is very slow.
## causes of ocean currents
Planetary Winds
Planetary winds blow with consistency, over the surface of the ocean, they tend to push the water in one direction because of friction.
This is the main cause of the flow of water. Hence, 2 is correct
o Because of the Coriolis Effect, in the Northern Hemisphere currents flow to the right of the wind direction while in the Southern Hemisphere, winds blow to the left.

Effect of the temperature
There are marked variations in the horizontal and vertical distribution of the temperatures in the ocean.
o In general, the temperature decreases as we move towards the pole from the equator.
There is an inverse relationship between temperature and density of the water i.e. higher the temperature, the lower will be its density.
o As a result, the warm and low-density water from the equatorial region moves towards the colder polar waters.
Contrary to this there is a movement of ocean water below the water surface in the form of subsurface current from colder polar areas to warmer equatorial areas.
o The Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current (warm) are very good examples of this.

Salinity
The salinity of the Ocean varies from place to place.
o Water with high salinity is denser than the one with low salinity.
Ocean currents on the water surface are generated from the areas of low salinity to the areas of high salinity.

Rotation of Earth
The rotation of the earth from west to east on its axis is the cause of a deflective force called Coriolis force.
o Similar to winds, it deflects the ocean current in the Northern Hemisphere towards its right and in the Southem Hemisphere towards its left

Configuration of the coastline
Coastline plays an important role in goveming the direction of the flow of the ocean current.
o For example, the equatorial current after being obstructed by the Brazilian coast is bifurcated into two branches.
The Northern Branch is called the Caribbean current while the Southern branch is called the Brazilian current.
The Revolution of the earth doesn't play any role in the formation of ocean currents.
