india’s relations with south asia & indian ocean region   (1:13:00 pm)

rationale behind neighborhood policy

aim of neighborhood policy is to have good relations with neighboring countries. as animosity will divert attention as well as resources.
to secure economic growth & development.
generally, neighbors face similar challenges therefore good neighborly relations offer prospects for dealing with these challenges better.
since indian has global power aspirations, it needs to establish itself as undisputed regional leader.
it's also important for india to check growing chinese influence in region.

## gujral doctrine
gujral doctrine  (1:30:00 pm)

it's based on principle of non-reciprocity.
it emphasizes that india should give what it can to neighboring countries of south asia except for pakistan what it can do in good faith & trust. india should not ask for reciprocity.
such cooperation will be based on condition that neighboring countries should not allow their territory to be misused against interest of india & each other.
india’s relations with its neighbors will not be based on quid pro quo.
it helps in establishing india as benevolent nation & helps to dismantle india’s image as big bullying brother.
it's combination of panchsheel principles & principle of non-reciprocity.

diff issues that complicate relations: kashmir, siachen, sir creek issue, indus water treaty, etc.

## timelines of events
timelines of events

1948 1st india-pakistan war. it came to end through un-mediated ceasefire agreement.
acc to un both country were expected to withdraw their forces to their original borders prior to war & then a plebiscite should be conducted in princely state to ascertain public opinion.
however, pakistan did not withdraw its forces from ceasefire line & continues to occupy nearly 1/3rd of territory of state.
in 1960: world bank mediated indus water treaty was signed b/w india & pakistan.
in 1965: 2nd india-pakistan war. it came to end with tashkent treaty of 1966. in this war, indian army reached up to lahore, very heart of pakistan but could not get back occupied kashmir territory from pakistan.
1971 war: pakistan was partitioned & bangladesh was created & it culminated with signing of shimla agreement.
under shimla agreement both countries agreed to rename ceasefire line as line of control (loc).
two countries agreed to resolve any bilateral disputes b/w 2 bilaterally without involvement of any 3rd party.
after humiliating defeat of pakistan in 1971 war, pakistan changed its strategy against india.
wage proxy wars by sponsoring cross-border terrorism against india as foll 1971 war, pakistan cannot win overt or open war against india.
it sought to pursue nuclear weapons to gain strategic parity with india.
in 1989: we see rise of kashmir insurgency. there was armed resistance against indian rule. some groups c/a for independence while others supported union with pakistan.
in 1998: both india & pakistan tested their nuclear weapons.
in 1999: vajpayee’s bus diplomacy to improve india’s pakistan relations.
following nuclearization of south asia, then superpower wanted to ensure peace in sub-continent. this resulted in lahore declaration. both countries recognized that they are nuclear power & therefore need to act responsibly.
both countries pledged to intensify their efforts to resolve all bilateral issues including that of j&k.
however, kargil war, 1999 spoiled all these efforts.
2001, agar summit: for 1st time pakistan acknowledged terrorism as a bilateral issue. it was tacit acceptance that pakistan is sponsor of terrorism in india.
in december 2001: parliament attack took place.
in 2004 composite dialogues started b/w india & pakistan. it adopted 2+6 approach or functional approach. it divided contentious issue into 2 groups. in 1st group, low-hanging issues (issues that can be relatively easily resolved b/w india & pakistan) have been kept. other ones were difficult issues.
six low handing issues: sir creek, siachen, tulbul navigation project, economic & commercial cooperation, promotion of friendly exchange in various fields.
two difficult issues recognized were kashmir & terrorist.
to utilize momentum generated as consequence to resolve highly contentious issue.
composite dialogue get abrupt end with mumbai terror attack in 2008.
in 2014, pm modi invited all saarc leaders for swearing of ceremony for his council of ministers. there was effort to resume composite dialogue as a comprehensive dialogue.
other steps like cricket diplomacy when pm modi c/a his counterpart in pakistan after india pakistan clash at 2015 world cup.
unusual step of a surprise visit by pm modi visiting lahore to attend pm nawaz sharif’s granddaughter while returning from afghanistan.
but this policy of engagement could not continue for long as india’s military establishment faced continuous attacks be it gurdaspur in july 2015, pathankot in january 2016, uri in september 2016.
it's then india adopted a realist posture c/a doval doctrine.
it adopted a strategy k/a defensive offence. it means undertaking offensive actions to ensure india’s defence against pakistan-led terror attacks.
under it, india would not shy away from using pakistan's vulnerability even use of money, weapons, & technology so that pakistan is deterred from undertaking offensive steps against india.
however, clearly, this approach failed as india faced 1 of biggest ever terrorist attacks on its armed forces, pulwama attack 2019 which killed 40 crpf soldiers.
in retaliation, india conducted balakot air strike. it was referred to as a “non-military preemptive strike to target training facilities of jaish-e-mohammad across loc.
5th august 2019, india abrogated article 370 & reorganized state of j&k into 2 union territories.
following it, india pakistan relations entered into a state of deep freeze.
evidence of deep freeze: pakistan banned all trade relations with india.
both countries downgraded their missions: rec/a their high commissioners & reduced mission strength to its half. they have shut down most diplomatic activities, no supporting visas or cultural exchange have taken place.
high-level visits b/w india & pakistan came to a halt. no such visit since 2015 when pm modi visited lahore followed by a high-level visit a few months later.
even on non-contentious issue, india & pakistan found it difficult to cooperate with 1 another. such as with respect to cooperation on covid pandemic, or locust invasion in recent times.
evidences early signs of a thaw in india-pakistan relations: agreement on ceasefire at loc which is being firmly held. soften language & speeches on importance of cross-border trade of pakistani leaders such as pm & their army general qamar bajwa.
messages have been exchanged b/w 2 pms, with pm modi enquiring about his counterpart's health.
sports visas were issued by india to 2 pakistani teams.

## reason for changes in pakistani approach
reason for changes in pakistani approach  (3:45:00 pm)

india has consistently maintained no engagement with pakistan until its support to cross-border terrorism end.
pakistan’s stand: it will not deal with india until india rollbacks abrogation of article 370.
pakistan is facing question of its economic survival be b/c pakistan has been a financial assistance-dependent economy.
in present times, its traditional financial lenders are not as willing to lend to pakistan.
west asian countries like south arabia & uae are undertaking a restructuring of their economy.
china has rescued pakistan financially a couple of times but pakistan is wary of borrowing from china given high-interest rates & other conditions associated with chinese loans.
an imf loan has helped pakistan’s economies stay afloat but strict conditions have made govt unpopular. (increasing electricity tariffs, withdrawal of income tax exception, etc.)
pakistan staying on fatf grey list.
in such a situation, military general qamar bajwa recently commented that pakistan needs to rethink its national security paradigm from purely military defence to economic security. he also commented that it's a rational choice to see region in terms of geo-economic integration than geostrategic rivalries.

topic for next class discussion: india-pakistan relations will be continued.
