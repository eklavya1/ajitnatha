- The **pilanesberg** (formerly Pilandsberg) is a mountain in the North West Province, [[South Africa]]. The mountain is an ancient volcanic structure, circular in shape, that rises from flat surrounding plains. It is formed by three concentric ridges or rings of hills, of which the outermost has a diameter of about 24 km. The Pilanesberg is located 100 km to the North-West of [[Pretoria]] and is for the greater part enclosed in a protected area known as Pilanesberg National Park.

The Elands River flows South of the Pilanesberg in an Easterly direction. There are a number of [[platinum]] mines right at the perimeter of the crater formation.

The name "Pilanes" comes from a historic Tswana chief named Pilane.
