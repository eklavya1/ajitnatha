- it was led by ishan chandra roy.
- it was supported by intellectuals such as r.c dutt, surendranath banerjee, bankim chandra chatterjee, etc.
- it was overall a peaceful movement.
- in east bengal, peasantry was oppressed by zamindars through ejection, harassment, illegal seizure of property, arbitrarily enhancement of rent and use of force.
- hence, peasants organised no-rent unions and launched armed attacks on zamindars and their agents.
- pabna district was storm-centre of this movement and thus, movement is known as pabna movement.
- it was suppressed only after armed intervention by british.
