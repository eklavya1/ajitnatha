westerlies, anti-trades, or prevailing westerlies, are prevailing winds from west toward east in middle latitudes b/w 30 & 60 degrees latitude.
they originate from high-pressure areas in horse latitudes & trend towards poles & steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner.
tropical cyclones which cross subtropical ridge axis into westerlies recurve due to increased westerly flow.
winds are predominantly from southwest in northern hemisphere & from northwest in southern hemisphere.
under effect of coriolis force, they become south-westerlies in northern hemisphere & north-westerlies in southern hemisphere.
they are more variable in northern hemisphere, but they play a valuable role in carrying warm equatorial waters & winds to westem coasts of temperate lands.
this warming effect & other local pressure differences have resulted in a very variable climate in temperate zones, dominated by movements 
of cyclones & anticyclones.
in southern hemisphere where there is a large expanse of ocean, from 400s. to 600s., westerlies blow with much greater force & regularity 
throughout the year.
they bring much precipitation to western coasts of continents.
weather is damp & cloudy & seas are violent & stormy.
it's thus usual for seafarers to refer to westerlies as roaring forties, furious fifties & shrieking or stormy sixties, acc to the
varying degree of storminess in latitudes in which they blow.
