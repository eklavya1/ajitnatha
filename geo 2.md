#quran - 2|4|وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَبِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ
# latitude
- 時 - `10:57 pm 23/8/2021`
- [[latitude]] - angle made with respect to [[equator]]
- every latitude is parallel to each other
- as we move from equator to [[poles]], length of latitude decreases
- _off notes_
- latitude in `angular distance` of a place of earth's surface measured in degrees from centre to north & south of equator
- `parallels of latitude`
	- imaginary lines connecting places with same latitude
	- are always parallel to each other as well as to equator
	- length of each latitude decreases towards poles & distance b/w 2 latitude in always constant
	- distance b/w 2 latitudes - 111 km
	- so 1 degree = 111 kms
	- so 1 degree = 60 minutes
	- 1 minute = 60 seconds
# longitude
- 時 - `11:03 pm 23/8/2021`
- longitude is angular distance of a place east or west on [[prime meridian]]
- meridians are semi-circles running from pole to pole connecting same [[longitude]]
- they are not parallel to each other, distance b/w 2 meridians of longitudes decreases towards poles & they are of same length
- dist b/w 1 degree of longitude @ equator is maximum & is equal to 111 km
- physically, [[prime meridian]] is situated at `royal astronomical observatory` as a mark of respect for its contribution to [[astronomy]]

# great circle
- 時 - `11:10 pm 23/8/2021`
- its largest circle that can be drawn on surface of [[earth]]
- it's circle with longest possible circumference drawn on earth along latitude.
- [[equator]] is only great circle & every meridian of longitude forms a part of great circle
- 1 can draw infinite number of great circles on globe
- application --> navigation (shortest dist b/w 2 places on earth always ie on a great circle) (asked in google interview !!)

### some terms
1. 0 degree - equator
2. 23 1/2 degree n - [[tropic of capricorn]] ????? should be cancer ??? #doubt 
3. 66 1/2 degree n - [[arctic circle]]
4. 66 1/2 degree s - [[antarctic circle]] 11:15 pm 23/8/2021
5. 0 degree meridian - [[prime meridian]] or [[greenwich]] meridian

# rotation & revolution of earth
- 時 - `11:16 pm 23/8/2021`
- axis of rotation [[rotation]]
- orbital plane
- angle of tilt - 23 1/2 degree
- andle b/w orbital plane & axis of rotation - 66 1/2 degree 12:02 am 24/8/2021
- direction of rotation - from west to east

# solar v/s sidereal day
- 時 - `12:03 am 24/8/2021`
- solar day - 360 deg rotation wrt [[sun]]
	- time taken by earth's rotation on its own axis so that sun appears on same position in sky (it's 24 hrs)
- sidereal day - 360 deg rotation wrt [[earth]]'s position (we can measure it by stars)
	- time taken by earth's rotation on its own axis so that distant star appears in same position in sky. ie 360 degree rotation

# speed of rotation
- 12:08 am 24/8/2021
- linear speed of rotation
	- it's highest @ equator ie why satellites are launched closer to equator so that it gives maximum thrust
	- equator - 1000 miles / hr
	2. poles - 0
- significance for space travel
	- launch projectiles from equator --> less fuel req
	- in india, `sriharikota` (in south india) --> southernmost launching facility, closest to equator

# circle of illumination
- 12:11 am 24/8/2021
- occurrence of day & night

# angle of incidence
- 12:11 am 24/8/2021
- angle of falling of sunlight & surface of earth
- significance
	- [[temperature]] ∝ angle of incidence
	- maximum @ equator,
	- min at [[poles]]
# revolution
- 12:13 am 24/8/2021
- [[geographical revolution]]
- linear speed - 100000 km/hr
- movement of earth around [[sun]] is in `elliptical shape`
- period of revolution - 365 days, 5 hrs & 48 min
- direction - w to e
- perihelion - position of earth when its closest to sun in its orbit `3 jan` #pre 
- aphelion - position of earth when its farthest from sun `4 july` #pre 
-  #pneumonic _p31 a47_ where 1 & 7 - months
