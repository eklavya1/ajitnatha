The Supreme Court upheld the 27% quota for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the All-India Quota seats for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test and reiterated that reservations for backward classes were not an exception but an extension of the principle of equality under Article 15(1) of the Constitution.[[a15 prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex]]

SECC 2011:
The Socio-Economic Caste Census of 2011 was a major exercise to obtain data about the socio-economic status of various communities.
It had two components: a survey of the rural and urban households and ranking of these households based on pre-set parameters, and a caste census.
However, only the details of the economic conditions of the people in rural and urban households were released. The caste data has not been released till now.
The Census provides a portrait of the Indian population, while the SECC is a tool to identify beneficiaries of state support.
Since the Census falls under the Census Act of 1948, all data are considered confidential, whereas all the personal information given in the SECC is open for use by Government departments to grant and/or restrict benefits to households.
precise number of the population of each caste would help tailor the reservation policy to ensure equitable representation of all of them.
There is a possibility that it will lead to heartburn among some sections and spawn demands for larger or separate quotas.
It has been alleged that the mere act of labelling persons as belonging to a caste tends to perpetuate the system.
