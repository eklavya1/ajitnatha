- in [[1336]], vijayanagar kingdom was established by harihara & bukka, who were 2 brothers & served in army of muhammad-bill-tughlaq. they broke away from delhi sultanate and established independent state in kamataka & established capital city vijayanagar on banks of river tungabhadra in [[1336]].
- harihara & bukka were helped & inspired by contemporary scholars & a saint vidyaranya for establishment of their kingdom.
