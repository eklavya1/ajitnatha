## mechanism of arriving at production cost

it makes projections using state-wise, crop-specific production cost estimates provided by directorate of economics & statistics in [[agriculture]] ministry.
latter is, however, generally available with a three-year lag.
cacp projects three kinds of production costs for every crop, both at state & all-india average levels.
'a2' - covers all paid-out costs directly incurred by farmer in cash & kind on seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, hired labour, leased-in l&, fuel, irrigation, etc
a2+fl' - includes a2 plus an imputed value of unpaid family labour.
'c2' - it is a more comprehensive cost that factors in rentals & interest forgone on owned l& & fixed capital assets, on top of a2+fl.
