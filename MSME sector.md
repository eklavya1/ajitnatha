*MSMEs have the 2nd largest share in terms of human resource employability after the Agriculture sector.*
It supplies an enormous variety of mass consumption products which includes readymade garments, hosiery goods, stationery items, soaps and detergents, plastic and rubber goods, processed foods and vegetables, etc.

# Additional Information
Challenges faced by the MSME
Finance crunch
	It is estimated that more than 90% of the MSME lacks credit facilities from formal institutions.
	They rely more on informal institutions like money lenders, who charge exorbitant interest rates.
Lack of basic infrastructure
	Though MSME has been growing rapidly, the lack of basic facilities like power, roads, connectivity to towns, etc has been hindering their growth potential.
Lack of technology
	We are, presently, in an era of a digital revolution.
	MSMEs, however, remain detached from technological advancements and hence produce low-quality products with high capital. Hence, Statement 3 is correct.
Lack of skill development and training
	MSMEs, in our country, is more like a family business.
	The skills get carried over by the next generation and the process goes on.
	With time, their adaptability to the present situation remains a cause of concem.
Ripple effect of a few government steps
	The steps like Demonetisation, GST, and the COVID-19 induced lockdown, though had noble intentions, have adversely affected the operation of MSMEs.
