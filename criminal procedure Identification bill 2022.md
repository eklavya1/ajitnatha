STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
The Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920 was enacted to authorise the taking of measurements and photographs of convicts and other persons. The term "measurements" used in the said Act is limited to allow for taking of finger impressions and foot-print impressions of limited category of convicted and non-convicted persons and photographs on the order of a Magistrate.
2. New ‘‘measurement’’ techniques being used in advanced countries are giving credible and reliable results and are recognised world over. The Act does not provide for taking these body measurements as many of the techniques and technologies had not been developed at that point of time. It is, therefore, essential to make provisions for modern techniques to capture and record appropriate body measurements in place of existing limited measurements.
3. The said Act, in its present form, provides access to limited category of persons whose body measurements can be taken. It is considered necessary to expand the ‘‘ambit of persons’’ whose measurements can be taken as this will help the investigating agencies to gather sufficient legally admissible evidence and establish the crime of the accused person.
4. Therefore, there is a need for expanding the scope and ambit of the ‘‘measurements’’ which can be taken under the provisions of law as it will help in unique identification of a person involved in any crime and will assist the investigating agencies in solving the criminal case.
5. The Criminal Procedure (Identification) Bill, 2022 provides for legal sanction for taking appropriate body measurements of persons who are required to give such measurements and will make the investigation of crime more efficient and expeditious and will also help in increasing the conviction rate.
6. The said Bill, inter alia, seeks:—
(i) to define ‘‘measurements’’ to include finger-impressions, palm-print and foot-print impressions, photographs, iris and retina scan, physical, biological samples and their analysis, etc.;
(ii) to empower the National Crime Records Bureau of India to collect, store and preserve the record of measurements and for sharing, dissemination, destruction and disposal of records;
(iii) to empower a Magistrate to direct any person to give measurements; (iv) to empower police or prison officer to take measurements of any person who resists or refuses to give measurements.
7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELAGATED LEGISLATION
Clause 3 of the Bill empowers the Central and State Governments to provide by rules the manner of taking measurements.
2. Clause 4 of the Bill empowers the Central Government and State Government to provide by rules the manner of collection, storage and preservation of measurements and sharing, dissemination, destruction and disposal of record by the National Crime Records Bureau.
3. Clause 6 of the Bill empowers the Central Government and State Government to make rules to provide the manner of taking measurements of persons who may resist or refuse to give such measurements.
4. Clause 8 of the Bill empowers the Central Government and State Government to make rules on any other matter which is to be prescribed, or in respect of which a provision is to be made.
5. Every rule made under this Act shall be laid, as soon as it is made or issued, before each House of Parliament and State Legislature.
