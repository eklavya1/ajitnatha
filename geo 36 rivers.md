# factors affecting indian climate:
overall climate is tropical, still, latitude extent of nearly 30 degrees is responsible for varied climatic conditions from tropical to sub-tropical types.
location:
near to indian ocean has resulted in moderating effect on climate
himalayan range protects india from cold & dry winds of central asia during winters. it also acts as a major factor in formation of indian monsoon.
topographical features such a western ghats being perpendicular to monsoon wind received very high rainfall whereas aravalis being parallel results in very low rainfall.

monsoon:
most dominant factor of indian climate is monsoon. therefore it's c/a monsoon climate.

jet streams:
sub tropical westerly & tropical easterly jet stream influences winter & summer weather conditions in india.

tropical cyclones:
eastern coast is largely affected by tropical cyclones.
el nino, la nina, iod, & mjo all influence indian climate

# mechanism of monsoon

word monsoon is derived from arabic word: mausam which means season.
classical theory:
this theory explains phenomenon of monsoon as huge land & sea breeze due to reversal of temperature & pressure conditions in northern plains from summer to winter.
during summers, high temperature & low pressure attract winds from arabian sea.
during winters, low temperature & high pressure cause wind to blow away from land to sea.
modern theory:
(dictation to be provided in next class)

next class: modern theory (dictation) & monsoon (continuation)
