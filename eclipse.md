- A lunar eclipse is a spectacular celestial show, during which the bright, pearly-white disc of the full Moon turns dark, and sometimes takes on the colour of dark copper, or even dried blood. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, the Earth and the Moon are so aligned that for a period of time, the full Moon passes through the shadow of Earth in space (called Earth‘s Umbra)

## blood moon
- During a total lunar eclipse, though the Moon gets shadowed by the Earth, sunlight passing through the Earth‘s atmosphere, break down in its constituent colours and the red part gets scattered by the atmosphere and falls on the Moon's surface, thereby making it take on a reddish copper hue. For this reason since antiquity, a totally eclipsed Moon is called a -`Blood Moon`. It has no other special relevance other than the fact that the colour of the Moon looks blackish-red
## blue moon
- When full Moon occurs twice in a calendar month it is termed a ―`Blue Moon`. The Moon does not turn blue but historically the second full Moon of an English calendar month is termed as a Blue Moon. Hence the oft-quoted phrase of a rare occurrence of any event as ―once in a Blue Moon.
## super moon
- When the Moon is near its perigee it looks larger than an average full Moon, and is termed a Super Moon.

- super moon = full moon 里 its nearest position to د earth
- blue moon = second full moon of د month
- blood moon = total lunar eclipse

- Solar eclipse happens once every 18 months, while at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year. Solar eclipses last only for few minutes while lunar eclipses can last for few hours. At least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, but total lunar eclipses are rare
