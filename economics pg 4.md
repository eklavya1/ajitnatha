The social impact assessment was introduced.
Study to indulge in the impact on families and societies.
Public infrastructure, livelihood, social indicators like health and education, etc.
Land administration, an independent body, should be doing the social impact assessment.
Further, multi-crop irrigated land will not be acquired.
Land acquired an equal amount of wasteland to be brought under agriculture.

## Market rate vs. Circle rate: (9:44 AM)

 The circle rate is decided for the government, however market value is fairly higher than the circle rate.
 However, often people complain of poor market rates.
 Land rehabilitation and resettlement body: It will have the power of the civil court.

## Features of Land Rehabilitation and Land Acquisition Act, 2013 (9:49 AM)

 The term ‘public purpose’ has been clearly defined under the Act.
 It includes elaborate categories such as National Security, Defense, projects for the housing of the low-income group, etc.
 Consent: No consent is required if the government acquires land for a public project.
 If the land is acquired for private companies, consent of 80% of the affected families is required.
 And in the case of PPP projects at least 70% of the families should give consent.
 Compensation under LRRA Act: 
 Owners of the acquired land shall be given 4 times the market values in rural areas, and 2 times in the urban areas.

## Social Impact Assessment: (9:56 AM)

 A comprehensive study on the nature and extent of likely social impact on the affected families would be carried out by the independent agencies.
 The final report will be put down in the public domain for public hearing and consultation. 
 This ensures that there is a free prior and informed consent of the landowners.
 Acquisition:  
 Every land acquisition project should have a resettlement and rehabilitation award.
 Multi-cropped irrigated land cannot be acquired, the state government would be specifying the limits in case it is necessary to acquire this land.
 In case of acquisition of fertile land, an equal amount of waste-land or barren land has to be brought under agriculture. 
 To adjudicate matters arising out of the implementation of the law, the state government will establish a Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Authority.
 Which authority will have the powers of a ‘civil court’.
 Right now, 13 central laws need to be streamlined with LARR Act 2013.
 In 2014, the NDA government came to power.
 It called for amendments, no consent, and no SIA study will be required for these 5 categories: 
 Rural infrastructure
 Defense 
 Affordable housing
 Infrastructure, including PPP projects.
 Industrial corridors.
 These amendments were introduced by ordinance twice.
 However, these amendments were not passed amid public protests.

## Working of Land Acquisition Act, 2013: (10:25 AM)

 The Land Acquisition Act, 2013, gives people a say in land acquisition and makes the process participative, humane and transparent.
 It attempts to put an end to forcible acquisitions, enhance compensations to landowners, resettle and rehabilitate the families displaced, and give people the decision-making power in land acquisition.
 However, the entire acquisition process can take up to 4, 5 years to complete and can pose direct and indirect costs on developers. 
 The direct cost is what developers pay, when land loses its compensation, and resettle and rehabilitate them.
 The indirect cost is what developers pay to carry out procedures, manage multiple level bureaucracy as well as revenue foregone, due to the time taken to acquire land.

## 2015 Proposed Amendment: (10:26 AM)

 This makes it easier for business players to acquire the land, amendments to this Act were introduced in 2014, under these amendments, 5 categories of projects, for exempt from the consent provision and the provision of Social Impact Study (SIA).
 Multi Crop irrigated areas could also be acquired for security and social infrastructure projects.
 However, the amendments could not be passed due to political backlash.
 Various state governments have bypassed this law and implemented their own acts incorporating these amendments, also a lot of states are using their old acquisition acts for acquiring land. 
 In 2007, about 25,000 farmers marched from Gwalior to Delhi, seeking reforms in land distribution.
