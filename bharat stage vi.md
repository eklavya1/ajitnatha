bharat stage iv grade fuel contains 50 ppm sulphur while bharat stage vi grade fuel has only 10 ppm sulphur.

## bharat stage emission standards
bharat stage (BS) are emission standards instituted by govt of india to regulate output of air pollutants from motor vehicles.
environment ministry is responsible for deciding fuel standard in country.
central pollution control board implements these standards.
BS regulations are based on european emission standards.
with implementation of new norms, pollution levels are expected to come down significantly as particulate matter (pm) will decrease. about 1/3 of air pollution is caused by cars & motor vehicles.
## advantages of bs-vi fuel over bs-iv fuel
BS-vi fuel, volume of pm 2.5 ranges from 20 to 40 micrograms/cubic metre whereas in BS-iv fuel it's up to 120 micrograms per cubic metre.
bs-vi fuel will bring down sulphur content by 5x from current bs-iv levels.
it has 10 ppm of sulphur as against 50 ppm in bs-iv.
[[sulphur]] in fuel contributes to fine particulate matter emissions.
high sulphur content in fuel also leads to corrosion & wear of automobile engine.
with bs-vi fuel, for every 1 kilometre, a car will emit 80% less particulate matter & nearly 70% less nitrogen oxide.
air pollutants in bs-vi fuel are much less as compared to bs-iv fuel.
bs-vi norms also seek to reduce level of certain harmful hydrocarbons in emissions that are produced due to incompl combustion of fuel.
## shift from bs-iv to bs-vi norms
shift from bs-iv to bs-vi compliant vehicles, in < year's time, poses a challenge for india's automotive sector.
shift makes on-board diagnostics (OBD) mandatory for all automobiles.
OBD unit will be able to identify likely areas of malfunction by means of fault codes stored on a computer ensuring that sophisticated emission control device which is fitted in a bs-vi vehicle runs at optimum efficiency throughout life of vehicle.
it will enable real-time emission tracking.
