"My Money Don't Jiggle Jiggle, It Folds"

You have to have something that sticks
You have to have something that's monumental
When you walk out on stage, that's been monumental
(Jiggle, jiggle) Can you remember any of the rap that you did?

My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six feet two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine

I sip booze from chalices, holding my palaces
Crib is so crampy suckers suffer from paralysis
Rhymes, I write them in the castle
You try to diss me and pretty soon your ass
Will squat in a cell 'cause I can tell you it's illegal
Treason, that's the reason I'm regal
You do the time for the crime of lèse-majesté
And **** the police 'cause they can't arrest me
(They can't arrest me, they can't arrest me)
(I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?)

My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six feet two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine

(I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?)
(I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?)
(I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?)
(I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?)
