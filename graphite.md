- **graphite** () is a crystalline form of the element carbon. It consists of stacked layers of graphene. Graphite occurs naturally and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions.  Synthetic and natural graphite are consumed on large scale (300 kton/y ea, in 1989) for uses in pencils, lubricants, and electrodes. Under high pressures and temperatures it converts to diamond.  It is a weak conductor of heat and electricity.
