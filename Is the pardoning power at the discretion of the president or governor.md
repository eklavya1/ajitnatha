# Is the pardoning power at the discretion of the president/governor? (3.32 PM)

- In [[Maru Ram vs UOI]] supreme court held the [[power]] under articles 72 _[[a72 Power of President to grant pardons, etc, and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases]]_  and 161 is not to be exercised by the president and the governor at their own discretion.
- Rather the president/ giver is bound by the aid and the advice of the council of the ministers.

In [[Kehar Singh Vs UOI]] supreme court held that:
	- Clemency power is not a matter of right rather it is an act of grace.
	- There is no oral hearing for these petitions.
	- The president is bound by the advice of COMs.
	- No need for the court to lay down specific guidelines.

Judicial review of clemency power:
	- In [[Epuru Sudhakar]] case :
	- The supreme court held that the judicial review of clemency power is allowed, but only in certain special circumstances.

- Judicial review should happen only when the order has been passed:
	- Without the application of mind. #humor 
	- Without taking the advice of the council of ministers.
	- It is [[mala fide]] in nature.
	- It is passed on wholly irrelevant considerations.
	- If relevant materials were kept out of considerations.

Can delay be a possible reason for a [[commutation]]?
	- In the [[Devendra Singh Bhullar case,2013]] the supreme court stated that if any person has been charged with Terrorism then the excessive delay will not lead to the commutation of the death penalty to lower punishment.
	- However, in the [[Shatrughan Chouhan Case 2014]], the supreme court overturned the judgment in the case of the Bhullar case.
- The court also held:
	- Excessive delay in the mercy petition can be ground for commutation of the death penalty to life imprisonment under articles 32 _[[a32 remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this part]]_  and 21 _[[a21 Protection of life and personal liberty]]_  of the Indian constitution.
	- The ministry of home affairs should place a petition with its recommendation as soon as possible in front of the president.
	- There should be at least 14 days between execution and rejection of the mercy plea.
	- Rejection of mercy plea must be communicated to convict and the family members in writing.
	- Post-mortem report to be given to family members.
	- Nature of crime no reason for the delay in execution or disposal of mercy plea.

- The topic for the next class: The discretionary power of the president, rest of the union executive.
