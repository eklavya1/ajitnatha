**agriculture sector during [[1950]] - [[1990]]**
At independence, about 75 percent of the [[country]]'s [[population]] was dependent on agriculture.
Productivity in the agricultural sector was very low because of the use of old [[technology]] and the absence of required [[infrastructure]] for the vast [[majority]] of [[farmer]]s.
The stagnation in agriculture induced as a result of colonial rule was permanently broken by the [[green]] [[revolution]].
This refers to the large increase in [[production]] of food grains resulting from the use of high-yielding variety (HW) seeds, especially for [[wheat]] and [[rice]].
The nation had immensely benefited from the [[green revolution]]. Thus, by the late [[1960]]s, Indian agricultural [[productivity]] had increased sufficiently to enable the country to be self-sufficient in [[food]] grains.
Economists have found that as a nation becomes more prosperous, the proportion of [[GDP]] contributed by agriculture as well as the proportion of the population working in the sector declines considerably.
In India, between [[1950]] and [[1990]], the proportion of GDP contributed by agriculture declined significantly from more than 50 percent in 1950 to 34 percent in [[1990]].
On the negative side, some 65 percent of the country's population continued to be employed in agriculture even as late as 1990. The population depending on agriculture declined slightly from 67.5 percent in 1950 to 64.9 percent by 1990.

India receives around 4,000 billion cubic meters (bcm) of rainfall, but a large part of it falls in the east.
Moreover, most of the rain is received within 100 hours of torrential downpours, making water storage and irrigation critical for agriculture.
India has one of the highest water usage for agriculture in the [[world]] — of the total 761 bcm withdrawals of water, <u>90.5%</u> goes into agriculture.
In comparison, [[China]] uses 385.2 bcm (<u>64.4%</u>) out of the total withdrawals of 598.1 bcm for agriculture.
China's per-unit land [[productivity]] in terms of crop production is almost two to three times more.
The total estimated groundwater depletion in India is in the range of 122-199 bcm.
The depletion is highest in [[Punjab]], [[haryana]], and western UP.

The agriculture sector uses a little over 90% of total water use in [[india]]
