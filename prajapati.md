- prajapati (sanskrit: प्रजापति, romanized: prajāpati, lit. 'lord of creation and protector') is a vedic deity of hinduism. in later literature, prajapati is identified with  the creator god brahma, but the term also connotes many different gods, depending on the hindu text, ranging from being the creator god to being same as one of the following: viswakarma, agni, indra, daksha and many others, reflecting the diverse hindu cosmology. in classical and medieval era literature, prajapati is equated to the metaphysical concept called brahman as prajapati-brahman (svayambhu brahman), or alternatively brahman is described as one who existed before prajapati.
