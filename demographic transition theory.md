it cn be used to describe & predict future population of any area.
theory tells us that population of any region changes from high births & high deaths to low births & low deaths as society progresses from rural agrarian & illiterate to urban industrial & literate society. these changes occur in stages which are collectively k/a demographic cycle.
in india, demographic transition is not yet complete as mortality rate has been reduced but birth rate has not been brought down to same extent.
first stage has high fertility & high mortality  b/c people reproduce more to compensate for deaths due to epidemics & variable food supply.
population growth is slow & most of people are engaged in agriculture where large families are asset.
life expectancy is low, people are mostly illiterate & have low levels of technology.
two hundred years ago all countries of world were in this stage.
fertility remains high at beginning of 2nd stage but declines with time.
this is accompanied by a reduced mortality rate. improvements in sanitation & health conditions lead to a decline in mortality.  b/c of this gap, net add. to population is high.
in last stage, both fertility & mortality decline considerably.
population is either stable or grows slowly. population becomes urbanized, literate, & has high technical knowhow, & deliberately controls family size.
