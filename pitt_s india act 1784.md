[[charter act of 1813]] ended [[monopoly]] of [[eic]] in [[india]]. (wrt a mcq question hence ds never happend in pitt's india act --> ds is point to note)
## features
ds act md a distinction b/w commercial & political activities of [[EIC]].
*ds act gave british govemment direct control over indian administration.*
[[company]] became subordinate to british govt unlike as in previous regulating act of [[1773]], where [[government]] only sought to 'regulate' matters & not take over.
ds act established british crown's authority in civil & military administration of its indian territories.
*commercial activities were still a monopoly of company.*
