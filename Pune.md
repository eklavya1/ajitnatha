- â€¢ Tambat Craft: The legacy of the Tambat or handcrafted [[Copper]]'s products dates to the 17th century when Tambat craftspeople were invited to Pune ([[Maharashtra]]) by the Peshwas after [[Shivaji]] set up the city as the [[capital]] city of the [[Maratha]] Empire. 'Matharkaam' or beaten work is the distinguishing feature of Tambat craft. The hand-beaten indentations, made by profiled beating hammers, strengthen the object and enhance the inherent [[rich]] surface by imparting a mirror-like appearance. It is a skill-intensive craft and needs strength, dexterity, and keen hand-foot-eye coordination.
