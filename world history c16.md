## stalin
(1:04pm)
stalin believed that only through rapid industrialisation which makes workers masses in russia, communism can be secured in ussr
he had huge distrust towards big landlords that is kulaks & viewed them as enemies of communism
he also had a phobia of western capitalist nations & believed that there would be another attack from capitalist west therefore wanted to militarise russia.
challenges that shape stalin's policies: 
lack of industrialisation: on eve of ww1 russian economy was largely agrarian followed by devastation of ww1 & russian civil war.
fdi was not available as communist russia was isolated politically & also due to great depression [[1929]] & therefore challenges of getting resources for industrialisation & militarization, esp in context of poor economy.
food security challenge- new economy policy of [[1921]] of lenin did focus on agriculture sector & situation improved. however, food security was still a challenge
separatism- 47% of russian [[population]] was ethnically diff & therefore challenge of separatism

### solution deployed/stalinism in operation
stalin establish a totalitarian regime (separatism/threat to communism)
all political opposition was purged within & outside party
stalin set up gulags that are forced labour camps similar to concentration camps of hitler. political opponents & activists have been sent to these gulags after arrest by secret police. many were executed & many were sent to exile outside russia 
ex- trotsky & his family were executed while in exile outside russia; great purged (1936-38). therefore there was rampant misuse of secret police.
media was under state control & no criticism of communism, communist party & communist leader were allowed. & role of media was to do propoganda for stalin & his policies. stalin also builds a cult of personality. ex- places & institutions were named after him. 
education was free but also compulsory & education system was designed to indoctrinate children & youth in favour of communism & stalinism. any form of separatist activities got brutally crushed
nationalisation of all industries that is state ownership & end of private ownership therefore state got control of industrial resources
 rapid industrialisation with a focus on heavy industry-
communism will be secure if workers are masses.
strong heavy industry would enable development of modern military
### forced collectivisation- 
private property was ended in agriculture sector & peasants were now organised into collectives. each collective had roughly 300 families & was allocated land for cultivation where peasants now worked as agrarian workers engaged in joint production. therefore, landowner peasant was converted to a landless agrarian worker. 
marx: workers are vanguard of communism. problem with peasants: petty bourgeoise+they only engage in family production
this ended threat of kulaks, therefore, made communism secure. 
stalin wanted to achieve food security with collectivisation as it would bring economies of scale as state would provide big machinery to collectives for production in big patches of land
with collectivisation, stalin could gather resources for industrialisation as now state became owner of all agricultural produce which could be now sold by state domestically & internationally & earn resources for investment in industry
stalin introduce 5 year plans that are command economy-
since resources were scarce therefore efficient planning was necessary & 5-year plan was introduced
targets & quotas were given to every psu. state told/made decisions about what to produce, how to produce, how much to produce & at what price to send. & therefore all decisions in economic process of production were determined by state & centre with no autonomy at factory level.
administered price instead of market price that is forces of demand & supply did not decide price 
state was sole procurer/ buyer & sole seller. state was owner of all products from factories & therefore allocated these goods for use as raw material to other factories. that is psu could not take direct orders from other psu for sale of goods. 
5-year plans were for whole economy that is agriculture sector, industrial sector, etc. 
this resulted in too much centralisation in economy which later contributed to economic crisis in 1980s 
stalin follwed aggressive foreign policy-
### started militarisation
shifted factories to east of ural mountain in anticipation of attack from west
during ww2, stalin captured estonia, latvia & lithuania, parts of poland, romania, of finland
also, it was during statin cold war began & ussr developed atomic & hydrogen bombs by 1953
in chinese civil war (1945-49) stalin supported ccp (1921)+ in 1st indo-china war (laos, vietnam, cambodia) (1946-54) (france supported us vs laos, vietnam, cambodia supported china & ussr)+ korean war (1950-53) (north korea supported by ussr in china vs south korea supported by us-led army of united nation)+ stalin made eastern europe sphere of influence by using secret police & military threats for rigging elections to ensure that puppet communist leader came to power in eastern europe & established a one-party system
negatives of stalin: light industry was neglected; totalitarian regime; too much centralisation in economy; cold war tension increased; collectivisation was brutal; challenges in food security  b/c no incentives for peasants; kulaks revolted
positives of stalin: by 1930s, nuclear power & partial success in social security; free & compulsory education, post ww2 ussr= superpower; 

## nikita khrushchev 1953- 64
(2:16 pm)
### destalinization
nikita khrushchev began destalinization that is reversed sum of policies of stalin
economy-
focus on heavy industries by stalin had led to neglect of light industry which is important for standard of ling of common man. therefore for 1st time, there was a focus on light industry. 
therefore light industry shortage was continued over longer term. 
5-year plans led to too much centralisation. nikita set up 100 regional economic councils. therefore some decentralisation in economic planning is introduced. 
however, there was still too much centralisation.
 nikita introduced capitalist measures, for ex incentives for manager to go beyond quotas provided by 5-year plan. 
in agriculture, virgin land scheme- uncultivated land of siberia & kazakhstan was made available to collectives for cultivation however scheme failed as storms used to deplete top layer of soil important for productivity. 
peasants were allowed to sell crops in market, which were grown in their small private plots 
polity-
### domestic polity:
ending gulak labour camps; reduced misuse of secret police; increase freedom of press- however, press could still not write anything against party or communist leaders including stalin that is no anti-stalin articles, novels or movies. 
ending gulak labour camps; reduced misuse of secret police; increase freedom of press- however, press could still not write anything against party or communist leaders including stalin that is no anti-stalin articles, novels or movies. 
in [[1955]] nikita gave speech & revealed details of stalin's purges 
cult of personality was decreased by renaming places named after stalin
### foreign polity:
1956, year of de-stalinisation
nikita stated that there exist multiple road to socialism & a common form [[1946]] was disbanded. 
common form [[1946]] was set up by stalin plus it had all communist parties of eastern europe as members. 
plus via common form stalin continued domestic policy of eastern europe
ex- forced ussr like communism in these countries i.e. collectivisation; industrialisation & militarilisation & 5-year planning.
nikita declared that eastern european countries should ally with ussr in foreign policies, not leave warsaw pact in 1955, not end communism, & otherwise, they can follow their own policies domestically to achieve socialism i.e. to follow their own road to socialism.
in 1948, february stalin stated that there cannot be peaceful coexistence with west until a final victory over capitalism. 
in contrast, nikita stated that peaceful coexistence with west is not just possible but essential to prevent a nuclear catastrophe (nuclear war)
by [[1952]] both ussr & us had hydrogen bomb.
therefore nikita works towards decreasing nuclear tensions. however, there was only a partial thaw in us & ussr relations. & cold war continued. ex: [[1954]] warsaw pact; 1956- hungarian uprising crushed;1961- berlin wall; 1961-75- vietnam war; 1962-cuban missile crisis

## brezhnev 1964-82
(03:09 pm)
also k/a era of stagnation due to lack of reforms in [[economy]] & [[polity]]
his rule is known for high bureaucratic corruption, lack of reforms & escalation of cold war except for 2nd 1/2 of [[1970]]s when there was a decrease in tension after end of vietnam war [[1961]]-75
he invaded czechoslovakia in [[1988]]; afghanistan from [[1978]] to 89; poland-[[1981]] when communist party rule was threatened in these countries. due to these military interventions, continuation of arms race economy of ussr was drained
ussr had to import [[food]] grain from us & by [[1980]]s there was a depression in ussr
therefore foundation of end of ussr was laid during this era.
