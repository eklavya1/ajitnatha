[[ecology]]
- • A harmful algal bloom (HAB) occurs when toxin-producing algae grow excessively in a body of water. The excessive algal growth, or algal bloom, becomes visible to the naked eye and can be green, blue-green, red, or brown, depending on the type of algae.
 - •  Red [[tides]], blue-green algae, and cyanobacteria are examples of harmful algal blooms that can have severe impacts on human health, aquatic ecosystems, and the economy.
 - • Conditions favoring the [[development]] of harmful algal blooms:
 - ◦ Harmful algae usually bloom during the warm summer season or when water temperatures are warmer than usual. Toxic blue-green algae prefer warmer water.
 - ◦ Algae need carbon dioxide to survive. Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air and water can lead to rapid growth of algae, especially toxic blue-green algae that can float to the surface of the water.
 - ◦ [[Coastal upwelling]]. Excess nutrients delivered by upwelling might lead to more algal blooms.
 - ◦ Low [[turbidity]] occurs when there is only a small amount of suspended matter present in the water column. When [[turbidity]] is low, more light can penetrate through the water column. This creates optimal conditions for algal growth.
 - • Harmful algal blooms can:
 - ◦ Produce extremely dangerous toxins that can sicken or kill people and animals
 - ◦ Create dead zones in the water
 - ◦ Raise treatment costs for drinking water
 - ◦ Hurt industries that depend on clean water
