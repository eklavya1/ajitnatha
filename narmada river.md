the narmada river, also called the reva and previously also known as narbada or anglicised as nerbudda, is the 5th longest river and overall longest west-flowing river in india, and largest flowing river of the state of [[madhya pradesh]]. this river flows through madhya pradesh and [[gujarat]] states of india. it is *also known as "life line of madhya pradesh and gujarat"* for its huge contribution to the state of madhya pradesh and gujarat in many ways. narmada rises from *amarkantak plateau* in anuppur district madhya pradesh. it *forms the traditional boundary between north india and south india* and flows westwards over a length of 1,312 km (815.2 mi) before draining through the [[gulf of khambhat]] into the [[arabian sea]], 30 km (18.6 mi) west of bharuch city ([[bharuch]] [[bharhut]]) of gujarat.it is one of only two major rivers in [[peninsular india]] that run from east to west (longest west flowing river), along with the [[tapti river]]. it is one of the rivers in india that flows in a rift valley, bordered by the [[satpura]] and [[vindhya range]]s. as a rift valley river, the narmada does not form a delta; rift valley rivers form [[estuary|estuaries]]. the other rivers which flow through rift valley include [[damodar river]] in chota nagpur plateau and tapti. the tapti river and [[mahi river]] also flow through rift valleys, but between different ranges. it flows through the states of madhya pradesh (1,077 km (669.2 mi)), and [[maharashtra]], (74 km (46.0 mi)),(39 km (24.2 mi)) (actually along the border between madhya pradesh and maharashtra (39 km (24.2 mi)) and then the border between maharastra and gujarat (74 km (46.0 mi)) and in gujarat (161 km (100.0 mi))).the periplus maris erythraei (c. 80 ad) calls it the nammadus, and the british raj called it the nerbudda or narbada. *narmada is a sanskrit word meaning "the giver of pleasure*".
