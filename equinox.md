Equinox is a unique phenomenon during which the earth's day and night are of equal length resulting in 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of the night in every part of the earth. This is not the case on other days.
The earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees because of which the length of the day and night differs according to the time of year and the region of the earth.
However, when the earth aligns itself with its orbit around the sun, equinox takes place.
This phenomenon occurs twice a year, once on March 20 and again on September 23.
During this time, the sun sits directly above the equator and both Northern and Southem hemispheres get equal day and night.
