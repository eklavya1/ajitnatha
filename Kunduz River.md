- The **Kunduz River** (Pashto: د کندز سیند; Persian: رود قندوز) is a tributary of the [[Amu Darya]] in northern Afghanistan. It rises in Bamyan Province in the Hindu Kush, and in its upper reaches is also known as the Bamyan River or the Surkhab River. After passing through Kunduz Province, the Kunduz River merges into the Amu Darya.
