Moose are striking in appearance because of their towering size, black color, long legs, pendulous muzzle, and dangling hairy dewlap (called a bell), and the immense, wide, flat antlers of old bulls.
The name moose is common in North America; it is derived from the word moosh ("stripper and eater of bark") in the Algonquian language of the Innu people of Quebec, Canada. In Europe moose are called elk.
Moose inhabit the northem parts of North America and Eurasia. Hence statement 4 is incorrect.
