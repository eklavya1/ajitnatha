- Brahmagiri is an archaeological site located in the Chitradurga district of the state of Karnataka, India.
- Legend has it that this is the site where sage Gautama Maharishi (also spelt Gauthama Maharshi) and his wife Ahalya lived.
- He was one of seven noted Hindu saints (Saptharshi mandalam).
- This site was first explored by Benjamin L. Rice in 1891, who discovered edicts of Emperor Ashoka here.
- These rock edicts indicated that the locality was termed as Isila and denoted the southernmost extent of the Mauryan empire.
- The Brahmagiri site is a granite outcrop elevated about 180 m. above the surrounding plains and measures around 500 m east-west and 100 m north-south.
- It is well known for the large number of megalithic monuments that have been found here.
- The earliest settlement found here has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BC.
- From Brahmagiri archaeologists found evidence of one skeleton was buried with 33 gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles, and one conch shell.
- Other skeletons have only a few pots. These finds suggest that there was some difference in status amongst the people who were buried. Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, others followers.
