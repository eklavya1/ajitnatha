“I shall not now speak of knowledge of Hindus, … of their subtle discoveries in science of astronomy-discoveries even more ingenious than those of Greeks and Babylonians-of their rational system of mathematics, or of their method of calculation which no words cn praise strongly enough—I mean system using nine symbols. If these things were known by people who think that they alone hv mastered sciences because they speak Greek they would perhaps be convinced, though little late in day, that other folk, not only Greeks, but men of different tongue, know something as well as they.” Syrian astronomer-monk SEVERUS SEBOKHT ( writing A.D. 662).

## PREFACE
[Page vii]
THIS book has been written to interpret ancient Indian civilization, as Iunderstand it, to ordinary Western reader who has little knowledge ofthe subject, but some interest in it. three nations of Indian Sub-continent, since momentous daysof1947 when they gained completeindependence, hv been playing an evergrowing part in affairs of theworld, and there is perhaps room for new outline of their ancient culture,to replace many excellent works now out of print, and to further ourunderstanding of civilization of these new states in contemporaryworld.

As this book is intended for general reader I hv tried, as far aspossible, to leave nothing unexplained. And as I believe that civilization ismore than religion and art I hv tried, however briefly, to cover all aspectsof Indian life and thought. Though primarily intended for Westerners I hopethat book may be of some interest to Indian, Pakistani and Sinhalesereaders also, as interpretation of friendly mleccha, who has great loveand respect for civilizations of their lands, and many friends among thedescendants of people whose culture he studies. work may also beof help to students who r embarking on course of serious Indologicalstudy; for their benefit I hv included detailed bibliographies andappendices. But, for ordinary reader, work is cumbersome enough,and therefore I hv not given references for every statement. I hv tried toreduce Sanskrit terms to minimum, but reader without backgroundknowledge will find definitions of all Indian words used in text in theindex, which also serves as glossary.

Sanskrit, Prākrit and Pāli words r transliterated acc to thestandard system at present used by Indologists; this, with its plethora ofdiacritic marks, may at first seem irritating, but it is only sound methodof expressing original spelling, and gives clear idea of correctpronunciation. Modern Indian proper names r generally given in mostusual spelling1 with addition of marks over long vowels, to indicatetheir approximately correct pronunciation. I hv tried to employconsistently names and spellings officially adopted by new states ofthe Sub-continent (e.g. Banāras for Benares, Uttar Pradesh for UnitedProvinces, etc.,) and as these do not appear in pre-war atlases they areshown in [Page viii] map of modern India in endpaper. 2 Throughoutthis work word “India” is of course used in its geographical sense, andincludes Pakistan. Though very inadequately, I hv tried to include in thescope of this survey Ceylon, whose culture owed much to India, butdeveloped many individual features of its own.

The translations, except where specified, r my own. I lay no claim togreat literary merit for them, and hv not been able to reproduce theuntranslatable incantation of originals. In most cases they r not literaltranslations, since character of Indian classical languages is so unlikethat of English that literal translations r at best dull and at worstpositively ludicrous. In places I hv taken some liberty with originals,in order to make their purport clearer to Western reader, but in all cases Ihave tried to give an honest interpretation of intentions of their authors,as I understand them.

In course of writing this book I hv asked advice of several friends and colleagues, and hv also received their encouragement and help in other respects. I must specially thank (in alphabetical order) Mr. F.

R. Allchin, Dr. A. A. Bake, Dr. L. D. Barnett (my respected teacher, whose Antiquities of India, written over forty years ago, has to some extent served as model for this book), Professor J. Brough (who first suggested that I should write this book), Mrs. Devahuti, Professor A. T. Hatto, Mr. J. R. Marr (for translations on p. 464ff), Dr. A. K. Narain, Professor C. H.

Philips, Mr. P. Rawson, Mr. C. A. Rylands, and Dr. Arthur Waley (for translations on p. 477f). I would also thank numerous institutions and individuals who hv kindly allowed me to reproduce illustrations of which they hold copyright, and whose names r recorded above each plate3; and Librarian and Staff of Library of School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, for their courtsey and help. Finally, I am greatly indebted to my wife for much encouragement.

## PRONUNCIATION
[Page xxi]
MORE detailed notes on Indian alphabet and its pronunciation r given in App. X, p. 506ff. following is rough guide for general reader.

The vowels ā, ī, ū, e, ai, o, au r long, and hv approximately same pronunciation as in Italian, or as vowels in English words calm, machine, rule, prey, time, go and cow, respectively. A, i, u r short, and equivalent to vowels in English words cut, bit and bull. reader should avoid temptation to pronounce as in English sat. Thus Sanskrit sama is pronounced as English summer. Ṛ is classed as short vowel, and is pronounced as ri in rich.

The aspirated consonants th and ph must never be pronounced as in English thin and phial, but as in pothole and shepherd. C is pronounced as ch in church. Ś and ṣ r both generally pronounced as English sh in shape.

The distinction between other sub-dotted “retroflex” consonants (ṭ , ṭ h, ḍ , ḍ h and ṇ) and dentals, without dots, is not important to general reader.

INTRODUCTION: INDIA AND HER ANCIENT
CULTURE


## LAND OF INDIA
[Page 1]THE ancient civilization of India grew up in sharply demarcated sub-continent bounded on north by world’s largest mountain range-thechain of Himalayas, which, with its extensions to east and west, dividesIndia from rest of Asia and world. barrier, however, was at notime an insuperable one, and at all periods both settlers and traders havefound their way over high and desolate passes into India, while Indianshave carried their commerce and culture beyond her frontiers by sameroute. India’s isolation has never been complete, and effect of themountain wall in developing her unique civilization has often beenoverrated.The importance of mountains to India is not so much in isolationwhich they give her, as in fact that they r source of her two greatrivers. clouds drifting northwards and westwards in rainy seasondischarge last of their moisture on high peaks, whence, fed by ever-melting snow, innumerable streams flow southward, to meet in greatriver systems of Indus and Ganges. On their way they pass throughsmall and fertile plateaux, such as valleys of Kashmīr and Nepal, todebouch on great plain.

Of two river systems, that of Indus, now mainly in Pakistan, hadthe earliest civilization, and gave its name to India.1 Fertile Plain of thePanjāb (“Five Rivers”), watered by five great tributaries of Indus-theJhelam, Chenāb, Rāvī, Beās and Satlaj-had high culture over twothousand years before Christ, which spread down lower course of theIndus as far as sea. lower Indus, in Pakistan province of Sind,now passes through barren desert, though this was once well watered andfertile land.

[Page 2] basin of Indus is divided from that of Ganges by Thar, or desert of Rājasthān, and by low hills. watershed, to north-west of Delhī, has been scene of many bitter battles since at least 1000B.C. western half of Ganges plain, from region around Delhī toPatnā, and including Doāb, or land between Ganges and its great tributary river Jamnā, has always been heart of India. Here, in regiononce known as Áryāvarta, land of Áryans, her classical culture wasformed. Though generations of unscientific farming, deforestation, andother factors hv now much reduced its fertility, it was once among themost productive lands in world, and has supported very largepopulation ever since it was brought under plough. At its mouth inBengal Ganges forms large delta, which even in historical times hasgained appreciably on sea; here it joins river Brahmaputra, whichflows from Tibet by way of Valley of Assam, easternmost outpost ofHindu culture.

South of great plain is highland zone, rising to chain of theVindhya mountains. These r by no means as impressive as Himalayas,but hv tended to form barrier between North, formerly calledHindustan, and Peninsula, often known as Deccan (meaning simply“South”), term used sometimes for whole peninsula, but more oftenfor its northern and central portions. Most of Deccan is dry and hillyplateau, bordered on either side by long ranges of hills, Western andEastern Ghāts. Of these two ranges western is higher, and therefore most of rivers of Deccan, such as Mahānadī, Godāvarī, theKistnā or Krsnā, and Kāverī, flow eastwards to sea. Two large riversonly, Narmadā and Tāptī, flow westwards. Near their mouths theDeccan rivers pass through plains which r smaller than those of theGanges but almost as populous. south-eastern part of Peninsulaforms larger plain, Tamil country, culture of which was onceindependent, and is not yet completely unified with that of North. TheDravidian peoples of Southern India still speak languages in no way akin tothose of North, and r of different ethnic character (p 24f), thoughthere has been much intermixture between Northern and Southern types.

Geographically Ceylon is continuation of India, plain of North resembling that of South India, and mountains in centre of island kthe Western Ghāts.

From Kashmīr in North to Cape Comorin in South sub- continent is about 2,000 miles long, and therefore its climate varies considerably. Himalayan region has cold winters, with occasional frost and snow. In northern plains winter is cool, [Page 3] with wide variation of day and night temperature, whereas hot season is almostintolerable. temperature of Deccan varies less with season,though in higher parts of plateau nights r cool in winter. TamilPlain is continuously hot, but its temperature never rises to that of thenorthern plains in summer.

The most important feature of Indian climate is monsoon, or “the Rains”. Except along west coast and in parts of Ceylon rain rarely falls from October to May, when cultivation cn only be carried on by carefully husbanding water of rivers and streams, and raising winter crop by irrigation. By end of April growth has practically ceased. Thetemperature of plains rises as high as 110 F. or over, and an intensely hotwind blows. Trees shed their leaves, grass is almost completely parched,wild animals often die in large numbers for want of water. Work is reducedto minimum, and world seems asleep.

Then clouds appear, high in sky; in few days they grow more numerous and darker, rolling up in banks from sea. At last, in June, rains come in great downpouring torrents, with much thunder and lightning.

The temperature quickly drops, and within few days world is greenand smiling again. Beasts, birds and insects reappear, trees put on newleaves, and earth is covered with fresh grass. torrential rains, whichfall at intervals for couple of months and then gradually die away, maketravel and all outdoor activity difficult, and often bring epidemics in theirwake; but, despite these hardships, to Indian mind coming of themonsoon corresponds to coming of spring in Europe. For this reasonthunder and lightning, in Europe generally looked on as inauspicious, haveno terrors for Indian, but r welcome signs of goodness of heaven(p. 255).

It has often been said that scale of natural phenomena in India, and her total dependence on monsoon, hv helped to form character of her peoples. Even today major disasters, such as flood, famine and plague, r hard to check, and in older times their control was almost impossible.

Many other ancient civilizations, such as those of Greeks, Romans andChinese, had to contend with hard winters, which encouraged sturdinessand resource. India, on other hand, was blessed by bounteous Nature,who demanded little of man in return for sustenance, but in her terribleanger could not be appeased by any human effort. Hence, it has beensuggested, Indian character has tended to fatalism and quietism,accepting fortune and misfortune alike without complaint.

How far this judgement is fair one is very dubious. Though an elementof quietism certainly existed in ancient Indian attitude [Page 4] to life,as it does in India today, it was never approved by moralists. greatachievements of ancient India and Ceylon-their immense irrigation worksand splendid temples, and long campaigns of their armies-do notsuggest devitalized people. If climate had any effect on Indiancharacter it was, we believe, to develop love of ease and comfort, anaddiction to simple pleasures and luxuries so freely given by Nature-atendency to which impulse to self-denial and asceticism on onehand, and occasional strenuous effort on other, were natural reactions.

## DISCOVERY OF ANCIENT INDIA
The ancient civilization of India differs from those of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece, in that its traditions hv been preserved without break down to present day. Until advent of archæologist, peasant of Egypt or Iraq had no knowledge of culture of his forefathers, and it is doubtful whether his Greek counterpart had any but vaguest ideas about glory of Periclean Athens. In each case there had been analmost complete break with past. On other hand, earliestEuropeans to visit India found culture fully conscious of its ownantiquity-a culture which indeed exaggerated that antiquity, and claimed notto hv fundamentally changed for many thousands of years. To this daylegends known to humblest Indian recall names of shadowychieftains who lived nearly thousand years before Christ, and theorthodox brāhman in his daily worship repeats hymns composed evenearlier. India and China have, in fact, oldest continuous culturaltraditions in world.

Until last half of 18th century Europeans made no real attempt to
study India’s ancient past, and her early history was known only from briefpassages in works of Greek and Latin authors. few devotedmissionaries in Peninsula gained deep understanding of contemporaryIndian life, and brilliant mastery of vernaculars, but they made no realattempt to understand historical background of culture of peopleamong whom they worked. They accepted that culture at its face value, asvery ancient and unchanging, and their only studies of India’s past were inthe nature of speculations linking Indians with descendants of Noahand vanished empires of Bible.

Meanwhile few Jesuits succeeded in mastering Sanskrit, classicallanguage of India. One of them, Father Hanxleden, who worked in Malabarfrom 1699 to 1732, compiled first Sanskrit grammar in Europeantongue, which remained in manuscript, but [Page 5] was used by hissuccessors. Another, Father Coeurdoux, in 1767, was probably firststudent to recognise kinship of Sanskrit and languages of Europe,and suggested that brāhmans of India were descended from one of thesons of Japhet, whose brothers migrated to West. Yet Jesuits, for alltheir studies, gained no real understanding of India’s past: foundationsof Indology were laid independently, in another part of India, and by otherhands.

In year 1783 one of most brilliant men of 18th century, Sir William Jones (1746–94) (pl. IVa), came to Calcutta as judge of Supreme Court, under governor-generalship of Warren Hastings, who himself had deep sympathy with both Muslim and Hindu culture. Jones wasa linguistic genius, who had already learnt all more important languagesof Europe as well as Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, and had evenobtained smattering of Chinese with aid of very inadequatematerial available in Europe at time. Before coming to India he hadrecognized relationship of European languages to Persian, and hadrejected orthodox view of 18th century, that all these tongues werederived from Hebrew, which had been garbled at Tower of Babel. Inplace of this dogma Jones suggested that Persian and Europeanlanguages were derived from common ancestor which was not Hebrew.

Of little band of Englishmen who administered Bengal for Honourable East India Company only one, Charles Wilkins (1749–1836), had managed to learn Sanskrit. With aid of Wilkins and friendly Bengālīpandits Jones began to learn language. On first day of 1784 theAsiatic Society of Bengal was founded, on Jones’ initiative, and withhimself as president. In journal of this society, Asiatic Researches, thefirst real steps in revealing India’s past were taken. In November 1784 thefirst direct translation of Sanskrit work into English, Wilkins’s BhagavadGītā, was completed. This Wilkins followed in 1787 with translation ofthe Hitopadeśa. In 1789 Jones translated Kālidāsa’s Śakuntalā, which wentinto five English editions in less than twenty years; this he followed bytranslations of Gīta Govinda (1792), and lawbook of Manu(published posthumously in 1794 under title Institutes of Hindoo Law).

Several less important translations appeared in successive issues of Asiatic Researches.

Jones and Wilkins were truly fathers of Indology. They were followed in Calcutta by Henry Colebrooke (1765–1837) and Horace Hayman Wilson (1789–1860). To works of these pioneers must be added that of Frenchman Anquetil-Duperron, Persian scholar who, in 1786, published translation of four Upanisads from [Page 6] 17th-century Persian version- translation of whole manuscript, containing 50 Upanisads, appearing in 1801.

Interest in Sanskrit literature began to grow in Europe as result of these translations. In 1795 government of French Republic founded École des Langues Orientales Vivantes, and there Alexander Hamilton (1762–1824), one of founding members of Asiatic Society ofBengal, held prisoner on parole in France at end of Peace of Amiensin 1803, became first person to teach Sanskrit in Europe. It was fromHamilton that Friedrich Schlegel, first German Sanskritist, learnt thelanguage. first university chair of Sanskrit was founded at Collegede France in 1814, and held by Léonard de Chézy, while from 1818onwards larger German universities set up professorships. Sanskrit wasfirst taught in England in 1805 at training college of East IndiaCompany at Hertford. earliest English chair was BodenProfessorship at Oxford, first filled in 1832, when it was conferred upon H.

H. Wilson, who had been an important member of Asiatic Society of Bengal. Chairs were afterwards founded at London, Cambridge and Edinburgh, and at several other universities of Europe and America.

In 1816, Franz Bopp (1791–1867), Bavarian, on basis of hints of Sir William Jones, succeeded in very tentatively reconstructing common ancestor of Sanskrit and classical languages of Europe, and comparative philology became an independent science. In 1821, French Société Asiatique was founded in Paris, followed two years later by Royal Asiatic Society in London. From these beginnings work of editing and study of ancient Indian literature went on apace throughout 19th century. Probably greatest achievement of Indological scholarshipin 19th-century Europe was enormous Sanskrit-German dictionarygenerally known as St. Petersburg Lexicon, produced by Germanscholars Otto Böhtlingk and Rudolf Roth, and published in parts by theRussian Imperial Academy of Sciences from 1852 to 1875. England’sgreatest contributions to Sanskrit studies were splendid edition of theṚ g Veda, and great series of authoritative annotated translations, SacredBooks of East. Both of these works were edited by great GermanSanskritist Friedrich Max Müller (1823–1900), who spent most of hisworking life as Professor of Comparative Philology at Oxford.

Meanwhile study of ancient Indian culture was proceeding in another direction. first work of Asiatic Society of Bengal had been almost entirely literary and linguistic, and most of 19th century Indologists were primarily scholars, working on written [Page 7] records. Early in 19th century, however, Bengal Society began to turn some of itsattention to material remains of India’s past, as East IndiaCompany’s surveyors brought back many reports of temples, caves andshrines, together with early coins and copies of inscriptions in long-deadscripts. By working backwards from current scripts older ones weregradually deciphered, until in 1837 gifted amateur, James Prinsep, anofficial of Calcutta Mint and Secretary of Asiatic Society of Bengal,interpreted for earliest Brāhmī script and was able to read edicts of thegreat emperor Aśoka. Among Prinsep’s colleagues in work ofdecipherment was young officer of Royal Engineers, AlexanderCunningham (pl. IV b), father of Indian archaeology. From his arrival inIndia in 1831 Cunningham devoted every minute he could spare from hismilitary duties to study of material remains of ancient India, until, in1862, Indian government established post of ArchæologicalSurveyor, to which he was appointed. Until his retirement in 1885 hedevoted himself to unravelling of India’s past with complete single-heartedness. Though he made no startling discoveries, and though histechnique was, by modern Archæological standards, crude and primitive,there is no doubt that, after Sir William Jones, Indology owes more toGeneral Sir Alexander Cunningham than to any other worker in field.

Cunningham was assisted by several other pioneers, and though at end of 19th century activities of Archæological Survey almost ceased, owing to niggardly government grants, by 1900 many ancient buildings had been surveyed, and many inscriptions read and translated.

It was only in 20th century that Archæological excavation on largescale began in India. Thanks to personal interest of Viceroy, LordCurzon, in 1901 Archæological Survey was reformed and enlarged, anda young archæologist, John (later Sir John) Marshall (pl. IV d), appointed asDirector General. For country of size of India ArchæologicalDepartment was still lamentably small and poor, but Marshall was able toemploy number of expert assistants, and had funds for excavation on ascale more extensive than anything previously attempted. For first timetraces of ancient cities of India began to come to light— archæology, asdistinct from surveying and conservation of ancient monuments, hadbegun in real earnest. greatest triumph of Archæological Survey ofIndia under Sir John Marshall’s directorship was undoubtedly discoveryof Indus civilization. first relics of India’s oldest cities were noticedby Cunningham, who found strange unidentified seals in neighbourhoodof [Page 8] Harappā in Panjāb. In 1922 an Indian officer of theArchæological Survey, R. D. Banerjī, found further seals at Mohenjo Daroin Sind, and recognized that they were remains of pre-Áryancivilization of great antiquity. Under Sir John Marshall’s direction siteswere systematically excavated from 1924 until his retirement in 1931.

Digging was interrupted by financial retrenchment, and by Second World War; but further important discoveries were made at Harappā during brief directorship of Sir R. E. Mortimer Wheeler just after war, though sites r still by no means fully cleared.

Much has yet to be done. Many mounds as yet unexcavated may throw floods of light on dark places of India’s past: unpublished manuscripts of great importance may yet lie mouldering in out-of-the-way libraries.

India, Pākistān and Ceylon r poor countries, desperately in need of funds with which to raise standard of living of their peoples; but with resources available archæological departments of all three countries r working to their fullest capacity to reveal past.

Even in last century, much valuable work was done by natives ofIndia, especially by such Sanskritists and epigraphists as Drs. Bhāū Dājī,Bhagavānlāl Indrājī, Rājendralāl Mitra, and great Sir R. G. Bhandarkar(pl. IV c). Now chief initiative in Indology comes from Indiansthemselves. Indians r well on way to completing first criticaledition of gigantic Mahābhārata, and hv started work on theenormous Poona Sanskrit Dictionary, which, when complete, will probablybe greatest work of lexicography world has ever seen. DirectorGeneral of Archæological Department is now an Indian (Dr. A. Ghosh),and today European Indologist cannot hope to be more than helperand friendly critic of Indian. In times like these, however, when Asia isreacting against century and half of European domination, and newculture, which will contain elements of East and West in firm synthesis, isin process of birth, European student still has useful role to play inIndology.

## GLORY OF ANCIENT INDIA
At most periods of her history India, though cultural unit, has been torn by internecine war. In statecraft her rulers were cunning and unscrupulous. Famine, flood and plague visited her from time to time, and killed millionsof her people. Inequality of birth was given religious sanction, and lot ofthe humble was generally hard. Yet our overall impression is that in noother part of [Page 9] ancient world were relations of man and man,and of man and state, so fair and humane. In no other early civilizationwere slaves so few in number, and in no other ancient lawbook r theirrights so well protected as in Arthaśāstra (p. 152f). No other ancientlawgiver proclaimed such noble ideals of fair play in battle as did Manu (p.

126). In all her history of warfare Hindu India has few tales to tell of cities put to sword or of massacre of noncombatants. ghastly sadism of kings of Assyria, who flayed their captives alive, is completelywithout parallel in ancient India. There was sporadic cruelty and oppressionno doubt, but, in comparison with conditions in other early cultures, it wasmild. To us most striking feature of ancient Indian civilization is itshumanity.

Some 19th-century missionaries, armed with passages from Hindu andBuddhist scriptures, often taken out of their context, and with tales offamine, disease, and evils of Hindu caste and family system, havehelped to propagate widespread fallacy that India is land of lethargicgloom. traveller landing at Bombay has only to watch rush-hourcrowds, and to compare dm mentally with those of London, to realize thatthe Indian character is neither lethargic nor unhappy. This conclusion isborne out by general acquaintance with remains of India’s past. Oursecond general impression of ancient India is that her people enjoyed life,passionately delighting both in things of senses and things of thespirit.

The European student who concentrates on religious texts of certain type may well gain impression that ancient India was land of “life-negating” 2 ascetics, imposing their gloomy and sterile ideas upon thetrusting millions who were their lay followers. fallacy of thisimpression is quite evident from secular literature, sculpture andpainting of time. average Indian, though he might pay lip-service tothe ascetic and respect his ideals, did not find life vale of tears from whichto escape at all costs; rather he was willing to accept world as he foundit, and to extract what happiness he could from it. Dandin’s description ofthe joys of simple meal served in comparatively poor home (p.,44ff) isprobably more typical of ancient Indian everyday life than r theUpanisads. India was cheerful land, whose people, each finding niche ina complex and slowly evolving social system, reached higher level ofkindliness and gentleness in their mutual relationships than any other nationof antiquity. For this, as well as for her great achievements in religion,literature, art and mathematics, one European student at least would recordhis admiration of her ancient culture.

1 Indians knew this river as Sindhu, and Persians, who founddifficulty in pronouncing an initial s, called it Hindu. From Persia wordpassed to Greece, where whole of India became known by name ofthe western river. ancient Indians knew their sub-continent asJambudvipa (the continent of jambu tree) or Bharatavar.sa (the Land ofthe sons of Bharata, legendary emperor) (p. 488f). latter name hasbeen in part revived by present Indian government. With Musliminvasion Persian name returnedintheformHindustan, and those of itsinhabitants who followed old religion became known as Hinduls.

2 This term, as applied to Indian religion, thought and culture, is that ofthe great Dr. Albert Schweitzer (Indian Thought and its Development, passim).

PREHISTORY: HARAPPĀ CULTURE
AND ARYANS


## PRIMITIVE MAN IN INDIA
[Page 10]LIKE prehistoric Europe, Northern India experienced ice ages, and it wasafter second of these, in Second Interglacial Period, from about400,000 to 200,000 B.C., that man first left surviving traces in India. Theseare palæolithic pebble tools of Soan Culture, so called from littleriver in Panjāb where they hv been found in large numbers. In typethey resemble tools widely distributed all over Old World, from Englandto Africa and China. In India no human remains hv been found inassociation with tools, but elsewhere such industries hv been shownto be work of primitive anthropoid types, such as Pithecanthropus ofJava and China.

In South there existed another prehistoric stone industry, which is notconclusively dated, but which may hv been approximatecontemporary of that of Soan Valley. men of this culture made coretools, especially fine hand axes, formed by striking off flakes from largepebble, and they evidently had muchbettercommandovertheirmaterialthantheSoan men. This Madras Industry, as it is called by thearchæologists, has affinities with similar core tool industries in Africa,western Europe, and southern England, where it hasbeenfound inassociation with more advanced type of man—a true Homo sapiens.The Ganges Valley is one of newest parts of earth’s surface, andmany geologists believe that at time of these two stone-age industriesmuch of it was still shallow sea; but there may hv been contact betweenthem by way of Rajasthan, for tools of one culture hv been foundsporadically in region of other. men who used these palæolithsmust hv lived in India for many millennia. Who they were and whatbecame of dm we do not know. Their blood may still flow in theinhabitants of modern India, but if pebble industry of Soan was thework of proto-human anthropoids they must hv vanished long ago, likethe Neanderthal men in Europe and Pithecanthropi of Far East.

Homo sapiens continued in India, his skill and technical equipmentimperceptibly improving down ages. He learnt to fashion microliths,[Page 11] tiny and delicate stone arrowheads and other implements, whichhave been found in many parts of India, from N.–W. Frontier to theextreme south. Similar microlithic industries occur in many parts of theNear East and Africa, but their chronological relationship with themicrolithic industry of India is not clear. In parts of Deccan microlithsare often found together with polished stone axes, and it would seem that inthe remoter parts of Peninsula their use was only fully replaced by thatof iron tools around beginning of Christian age. 1


## FIRST VILLAGES
Palæolithic man was hunter and food gatherer, and lived in very small communities, which were usually nomadic. In course of time he learnt to kindle fire, to protect his body from weather with skin, bark or leaves, and to tame wild dog which lurked round his campfire. In India, as all over world, men lived thus for many millennia.

Then, very recently in perspective of geological time, great changes took place in man’s way of living. Certainly not much earlier than 10,000B.C., and perhaps as late as 6000 B.C., man developed what Professor GordonChilde calls “an aggressive attitude to his environment”. He learnt how togrow food crops, he tamed domestic animals, he made pots, and he wovegarments. Before discovering use of metal, he taught himself to makewell-polished stone implements far in advance of those of palæolithicage. Such implements hv been found all over India, but mostly in theNorth-West and in Deccan, and usually on or near surface. In muchof country neolithic culture survived long, and many of wilder hilltribes of present day hv only recently emerged from this stage.

Developed agriculture and permanent villages probably began in 5th millennium B.C., in Middle East. In India earliest remains of settled culture r of little agricultural villages in Balūchistān and lower Sind,perhaps dating from end of 4th millennium.

Classical writers show that when, in 326 B.C., Alexander of Macedoncrossed Indus, climate of N.–W. India was much as it is today,though perhaps little moister. river valleys were fertile and wellwooded, though coastal strip to west of Indus, now called theMakrān, and much of Balūchistān, were already dry and desolate. But in3000 B.C. climate was very different. whole Indus region was wellforested, providing fuel to burn [Page 12] bricks and food for wildelephants and rhinoceros, and Balūchistān, now almost waterless desert,was rich in rivers. This region supported many villages of agriculturists,who had settled in upland valleys of Balūchistān and in then fertileplain of Makrān and lower Indus.



Fig. i.—Some Prehistoric Sites of N.–W. India
These people belonged to several cultures, primarily distinguished by different types of painted pottery. Each culture had distinctive features of its own, but all were of same generic pattern as those of Middle East.

Though their settlements were small, rarely more than few acres in extent,their material standards were comparatively high. villagers dwelt incomfortable houses of mud brick with lower courses of stone, and madegood pottery, which they painted with pleasant patterns. They knew useof metal, for few copper implements hv been discovered in sites.

[Page 13]


Fig. ii.—Terracotta Figurines of Goddesses. a. Kullī, c. 2500–2000 B.C. b. Zhob, c. 2500–2000
B.C. c. Harappā, c. 2000 B.C. d. Kaūāambī, c. 100 B.C.

The village cultures had varying customs, for secluded valleys of Brāhūī Hills and comparative simplicity of lives of inhabitants did not encourage very close contact. Thus northern villages madepredominantly red pottery, and southern buff; people of KullīCulture, in Makrān, burnt their dead, while those of Nāl Culture, inthe Brāhuī Hills, practised fractional burial, or inhumation of bonesafter partial disintegration by burning or exposure.

Their religion was of type practised by other early agriculturalcommunities in Mediterranean region and Middle East, centringround fertility rites and worship of Mother Goddess. Figurines of theGoddess hv been found in many sites, and in those of Zhob Culture,to north of Quetta, phallic emblems hv also been found. In many ancient cultures worship of Mother [Page 14] Goddess wasassociated with that of bull, and these were no exception. Bull figurineshave been discovered, and bull forms favourite motif for thedecoration of pottery of Kullī and Rānā Ghundāī, one of mostimportant of Zhob sites.

The people of Kullī culture excelled in making small boxes of soft stone, delicately engraved with linear patterns. Such boxes hv beenoccasionally found in early Mesopotamian sites, and we may assume thatthey were exported by Kullī people, perhaps filled with unguent orperfume of some kind. At Susa and elsewhere hv been found few piecesof painted pottery which r evidently imitated from wares of Kullīpeople, who obviously traded with Middle East. Otherwise there is littleevidence of contact. No certainly identifiable Mesopotamian remains havebeen found in BalūichistĀn, and there is no trace of objects from KullīCulture along overland route. It seems that Kullī people madecontact with earliest Mesopotamian civilizations by sea.



## HARAPPĀ CITY CULTURE
In early part of 3rd millennium, civilization, in sense of an organized system of government over comparatively large area, developed nearly simultaneously in river valleys of Nile, Euphrates, and Indus.
We know great deal about civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, for they hv left us written material which has been satisfactorily deciphered.

The Indus people, on other hand, did not engrave long inscriptions on stone or place papyrus scrolls in tombs of their dead; all that we know of their writing is derived from brief inscriptions of their seals, and there is no Indian counterpart of Rosetta Stone. Several brilliant efforts havebeen made to read Indus seals, but none so far has succeeded. Hence ourknowledge of Indus civilization is inadequate in many respects, and itmust be classed as prehistoric, for it has no history in strict sense of theterm.

The civilization of Indus is known to archæologist as Harappa Culture, from modern name of site of one of its two great cities, onthe left bank of Rāvī, in Panjāb. Mohenjo Daro, second city, ison right bank of Indus, some 250 miles from its mouth. As well asthese two cities at least three small towns r known, and large number ofvillage sites, from Rūbpar on upper Satlaj to Rangpur in Kāthiāwār. area covered by Harappā Culture therefore extended for some 950 milesfrom north to south, and pattern of its civilization was so uniform thateven bricks were usually of same size and shape from one [Page 15]end of it to other. Outside this area village cultures of Balūchistānseem to hv continued much as before.

This great civilization owed little to Middle East, and there is no reason to believe that it was formed by recent immigrants; cities were built by people who had probably been in Indus Valley for several centuries. Harappā people were already Indians when they planned their cities, and they altered hardly at all for thousand years. We cannot fix precise date for beginning of this civilization, but certain indications synchronize it roughly with village cultures of Balūchistān. site ofRana Ghundai produced stratification which showed, in third phase ofthe village’s history, type of pottery with bold designs in black on redbackground. From evidence discovered by Sir R. Mortimer Wheeler in1946 it seems that city of Harappā was built on site occupied bypeople using similar pottery. There is no evidence of date of thefoundation of other great city of Mohenjo Daro, for its lowest strata arenow below level of Indus, whose bed has slowly risen with thecenturies; though diggings hv reached 30 feet below surface, floodinghas prevented excavation of earliest levels of city.

Thus Harappā Culture, at least in Panjāb, was later in itsbeginnings than village cultures, but it was certainly in partcontemporary with them, for traces of mutual contact hv been found; andsome of village cultures survived great civilization to east ofthem. From faint indications which r all evidence we have, itwould seem that Indus cities began in first half, perhaps towards themiddle, of 3rd millennium B.C.; it is almost certain that they continuedwell into 2nd millennium. When these cities were first excavated nofortifications and few weapons were found, and no building could becertainly identified as temple or palace. hypothesis was then putforward that cities were oligarchic commercial republics, without sharpextremes of wealth and poverty, and with only weak repressiveorganization; but excavations at Harappā in 1946 and further discoveriesat Mohenjo Daro hv shown that this idyllic picture is incorrect. Each cityhad well-fortified citadel, which seems to hv been used for bothreligious and governmental purposes. regular planning of streets,and strict uniformity throughout area of Harappā culture in suchfeatures as weights and measures, size of bricks, and even layout ofthe great cities, suggest rather single centralized state than number offree communities.

Probably most striking feature of culture was its intense [Page 16] conservatism. At Mohenjo Daro nine strata of buildings hv been revealed.

As level of earth rose from periodic flooding of Indus newhouses would be built almost exactly on sites of old, with onlyminor variations in ground plan; for nearly millennium at least streetplan of cities remained same. script of Indus people wastotally unchanged throughout their history. There is no doubt that they hadcontact with Mesopotamia, but they showed no inclination to adopt thetechnical advances of more progressive culture. We must assume thatthere was continuity of government throughout life of civilization.

This unparalleled continuity suggests, in words of Professor Piggott, “the unchanging traditions of temple” rather than “the secular instability of court”. 2 It seems in fact that civilization of Harappa, like those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, was theocratic in character.

The two cities were built on similar plan. To west of each was “citadel”, an oblong artificial platform some 30–50 feet high and about 400 x 200 yards in area (pl. V). This was defended by crenelated walls, and on it were erected public buildings. Below it was town proper, in eachcase at least square mile in area. main streets, some as much as 30feet wide, were quite straight (pl. VI a), and divided city into largeblocks, within which were networks of narrow unplanned lanes. In neitherof great cities has any stone building been found; standardized burntbrick of good quality was usual building material for dwelling housesand public buildings alike. houses, often of two or more stories, thoughthey varied in size, were all based on much same plan—a squarecourtyard, round which were number of rooms. entrances wereusually in side alleys, and no windows faced on streets, which musthave presented monotonous vista of dull brick walls. houses hadbathrooms, design of which shows that Harappan, like modernIndian, preferred to take his bath standing, by pouring pitchers of waterover his head. bathrooms were provided with drains, which flowed tosewers under main streets, leading to soak-pits. sewers werecovered throughout their length by large brick slabs. unique seweragesystem of Indus people must hv been maintained by some municipalorganization, and is one of most impressive of their achievements. Noother ancient civilization until that of Romans had so efficient systemof drains.

The average size of ground floor of house was about 30 feet square, but there were many bigger: obviously there were numerous well-to-do families in Indus cities, which perhaps had middle [Page 17] class larger and more important in social scale than those of contemporary civilizations of Sumer and Egypt. Remains of workmen’s dwellings hv also been discovered at both sites-parallel rows of two-roomed cottages, atMohenjo Daro with superficial area of 20 x 12 feet each, but at Harappāconsiderably larger; they bear striking resemblance to “coolie lines” ofmodern Indian tea and other estates. At Harappā rows of such buildingshave been found near circular brick floors on which grain was pounded,and they were probably dwellings of workmen whose task was togrind corn for priests and dignitaries who lived in citadel. Drab andtiny as they were, these cottages were better dwellings than those in whichmany Indian coolies live at present day.


Fig. iii.—Interior of House of Harappā Culture
(By permission Dept. of Archæology Government of India, and Arthur Probsthain, London.)

The most striking of few large buildings is great bath in citadel area of Mohenjo Daro. This is an oblong bathing pool 39 x 23 feet in area and 8 feet deep, constructed of beautiful brickwork made watertightwith bitumen (pl. VI b). It could be drained by [Page 18] an opening in onecorner and was surrounded by cloister, on to which opened number ofsmall rooms. Like “tank” of Hindu temple, it probably had religiouspurpose, and cells may hv been homes of priests. specialattention paid by people of Harappā culture to cleanliness is hardlydue to fact that they had notions of hygiene in advance of those of othercivilizations of their time, but indicates that, like later Hindus, they hada strong belief in purificatory effects of water from ritual point ofview.

The largest building so far excavated is one at Mohenjo Daro with superficial area of 230 x 78 feet, which may hv been palace. At Harappā great granary has been discovered to north of citadel; thiswas raised on platform of some 150 x 200 feet in area to protect it fromfloods, and was divided into storage blocks of 50 x 20 feet each. It wasdoubtless used for storing corn which was collected from peasantsas land tax, and we may assume that it had its counterpart at Mohenjo Daro.

The main food crops were wheat, barley, peas, and sesamum, latter still an important crop in India for its seeds, which provide edible oil. There is no clear evidence of cultivation of rice, but Harappā people grew and used cotton. It is not certain that irrigation was known, although this is possible. main domestic animals known to modern India had already been tamed-humped and humpless cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep, pigs,asses, dogs, and domestic fowl. elephant was well known, and mayalso hv been tamed. Harappa people may hv known of horse,since few horse’s teeth hv been found in lowest stratum of theBalūchistān site of Rānā Ghundāī, probably dating from several centuriesearlier than foundation of Harappā. This would indicate that horse-riding nomads found their way to N.-W. India in small numbers long beforethe Āryan invasion; but it is very doubtful whether Harappa peoplepossessed domestic horses themselves, and if they did they must hv beenvery rare animals. bullock was probably usual beast of burden.

On basis of this thriving agricultural economy Harappa peoplebuilt their rather unimaginative but comfortable civilization. Theirbourgeoisie had pleasant houses, and even their workmen, who may havebeen bondmen or slaves, had comparative luxury of two-roomed brick-built cottages. Evidently well organized commerce made these thingspossible. cities undoubtedly traded with village cultures ofBalūchistān. where outposts of Harappa culture hv been traced, butmany of their metals and semi-precious stones came from much longerdistances. From Kathiawar and [Page 19] Deccan they obtained conchshell, which they used freely in decoration, and several types of stone.

Silver, turquoise and lapis lazuli were imported from Persia and Afghanistan. Their copper came either from Rajasthan or from Persia, while jadeite was probably obtained from Tibet or Central Asia.

Though their culture extended nearly to mouth of Indus people of Harappā and Mohenjo Daro seem to hv cared little for sea.

Only two representations of ships hv been found among their remains,and these r of small river vessels. But whether by sea or land, theproducts of Indus reached Mesopotamia, for number of typical Indusseals and few other objects from Indus Valley hv been found inSumer at levels dating between about 2300 and 2000 B.C. Evidence ofSumerian exports to India is very scant and uncertain, and we must assumethat they were mainly precious metals and raw materials. finding ofIndus seals suggests that merchants from India actually resided inMesopotamia; their chief merchandise was probably cotton, which hasalways been one of India’s staple exports, and which is known to hv beenused in later Babylonia.

It seems that every merchant or mercantile family had seal, bearing anemblem, often of religious character, and name or brief inscription in thetantalizingly indecipherable script. standard Harappā seal was squareor oblong plaque, usually made of soft stone called steatite, which wasdelicately engraved and hardened by heating (pl. IX). Mesopotamiancivilizations employed cylinder seals, which were rolled on clay tablets,leaving an impressed band bearing device and inscription of seal;one or two such seals hv been found in Mohenjo Daro, but with devicesof Harappa type. Over 2,000 seals hv been discovered in Induscities so far, and it would seem that every important citizen possessed one.

Their primary purpose was probably to mark ownership of property, but they doubtless also served as amulets, and were regularly carried on persons of their owners. Generally they depict animals, such as bull,buffalo, goat, tiger and elephant, or what appear to be scenes from religiouslegend. Their brief inscriptions, never of more than twenty symbols andusually of not more than ten, r only significant examples of theHarappa script to hv survived.

This script had some 270 characters, evidently pictographic in origin, which had an ideographic or syllabic character. It may hv been inspired by earliest Sumerian script, which probably antedates it slightly, but it bears little resemblance to any of scripts of ancient Middle East, though attempts hv been made to connect [Page 20] it with one or otherof them. most striking similarities r with symbols used untilcomparatively recent times by natives of Easter Island, in easternPacific,3 but distance in space and time between two cultures is sogreat that there is scarcely any possibility of there having been any form ofcontact or influence. We do not know what writing media were used,though it has been suggested that small pot found at lesser site ofChanhu Daro is an inkwell. Certainly Harappans did not inscribe theirdocuments on clay tablets, or some of these would hv been found in theremains of their cities.

They were not on whole an artistic people. No doubt they had aliterature, with religious epics similar to those of Sumer and Babylon, butthese r forever lost to us. inner walls of their houses were coated withmud plaster, but if any paintings were made on these walls all trace of themhas vanished. outer walls, facing streets, were apparently of plainbrick. Architecture was austerely utilitarian, few examples of simpledecorative brickwork being only ornamentation so far discovered. Notrace of monumental sculpture has been found anywhere in remains, andif any of larger buildings were temples they contained no large icons,unless these were made of wood or other perishable material.

But if Harappā folk could not produce works of art on large scale they excelled in those of small compass. Their most notable artistic achievement was perhaps in their seal engravings, especially those of animals, which they delineated with powerful realism and evident affection.

The great urus bull with its many dewlaps, rhinoceros with knobbly armoured hide, tiger roaring fiercely, and many other animals (pl.

IX) r work of craftsmen who studied their subjects and loved them.

Equally interesting r some of human figurines. red sandstone torso of man (pl. VIII a) is particularly impressive for its realism. modelling of rather heavy abdomen seems to look forward to style of later Indian sculpture, and it has even been suggested that this figurine isa product of much later times, which by some strange accident found itsway into lower stratum; but this is very unlikely, for figure hascertain features, notably strange indentations on shoulders, whichcannot be explained on this hypothesis. bust of another male figure, insteatite (pl. VII), seems to show an attempt at portraiture. It has beensuggested that head is that of priest, with his eyes half closed inmeditation, but it is possible that he is man of Mongolian type, thepresence of which type in Indus Valley has been proved by thediscovery of single skull at Mohenjo Daro.

[Page 21] Most striking of figurines is perhaps bronze “dancing girl” (pl. VIII b). Naked but for necklace and series of bangles almost covering one arm, her hair dressed in complicated coiffure, standing in provocative posture, with one arm on her hip and one lanky leg half bent,this young woman has an air of lively pertness, quite unlike anything in thework of other ancient civilizations. Her thin boyish figure, and those of theuninspiring mother goddesses, indicate, incidentally, that canons offemale beauty among Harappa people were very different from those oflater India. It has been suggested that this “dancing girl” is representativeof class of temple dancers and prostitutes, such as existed in contemporaryMiddle Eastern civilizations and were an important feature of later Hinduculture, but this cannot be proved. It is not certain that girl is dancer,much less temple dancer.

The Harappā people made brilliantly naturalistic models of animals, specially charming being tiny monkeys and squirrels used as pinheads and beads (pl. IX g). For their children they made cattle with movable heads, model monkeys which would slide down string, little toy carts, andwhistles shaped like birds, all of terracotta. They also made rough terracottastatuettes of women, usually naked or nearly naked, but with elaboratehead-dresses (fig. ii, c); these r certainly icons of Mother Goddess,and r so numerous that they seem to hv been kept in nearly every home.

They r very crudely fashioned, so we must assume that goddess was not favoured by upper classes, who commanded services of best craftsmen, but that her effigies were mass produced by humble potters to meet popular demand.

Though they had not completely given up use of stone tools theHarappā people used implements of copper and bronze; but in manyrespects they were technologically backward in comparison withMesopotamia. Sumerians very early invented knives and spearheadswith ribs in middle for extra strength, and axeheads with holes for theshafts; but blades of Harappā were flat and easily bent, while theaxeheads had to be lashed to their shafts; only in topmost levels do wefind tools of better type, which were probably left by invaders. In onerespect Harappā people were technically in advance of theircontemporaries-they had devised saw with undulating teeth, whichallowed dust to escape freely from cut, and much simplified thecarpenter’s task. From this we may assume that they had particular skill incarpentry. They made beautiful beads of semi-precious stones and faience,and their pottery, though mostly plain and uninteresting, was well made,and few specimens r delicately painted (fig. iv).

[Page 22] men wore robes which left one shoulder bare, and garments of upper classes were often richly patterned. Beards wereworn, and men and women alike had long hair. elaborate headdressesof Mother Goddess figures probably had their counterparts in festiveattire of richer women. goddesses often wear only very short skirt,but on one seal women, perhaps priestesses, r depicted with longer skirts,reaching to just below knee. coiffures of women were oftenelaborate, and pigtails were also popular, as in present-day India. Womenloved jewellery, and wore heavy bangles in profusion, large necklaces, andearrings.

As far as we cn reconstruct it from our fragmentary knowledge, thereligion of Harappā people had some features suggesting thosecharacteristics of later Hinduism which r not to be found in earlieststratum of Indian religious literature. Mother Goddess, for instance,reappears only after lapse of over thousand years from fall ofHarappa. As already stated she was evidently divinity of people, andthe upper classes seem to hv preferred god, who also shows featuresfound in later Hinduism. As well as figurines already mentioned, whichmay represent divinities, there r few in terracotta of bearded nude menwith coiled hair; their posture, rigidly upright, with legs slightly apart,and arms held parallel to sides of body, but not touching it,closely resembles stance called by Jainas kāyotsarga, in whichmeditating teachers r often portrayed in later times; repetition of thisfigure, in exactly same posture, would suggest that he was god. Aterracotta mask of horned deity has also been found.

Fig. iv.—Painted Pottery of Harappā CultureThe most striking deity of Harappā culture is horned god of theseals (pl. IX c). He is depicted on three specimens, in two [Page 23] seatedon stool or small dais, and in third on ground; in all three hisposture is one well known to later Indian holy men, with legs drawn upclose to body and two heels touching, position quite impossible tothe average European without much practice. god’s body is nude,except for many bangles and what appear to be necklaces, and he wears apeculiar head-dress, consisting of pair of horns, which may hv beenthought of as growing from his head, with plant-like object between them.

On largest of seals he is surrounded by four wild animals, an elephant, tiger, rhinoceros and buffalo, and beneath his stool r two deer, as in representations of Buddha preaching his first sermon in Deer-park at BanĀras animals, plant-like growth from head,and fact that he is ithyphallic, indicate that he is fertility god. His facehas fierce tigerish aspect, and one authority has suggested that it is notmeant to be human; 4 to right and left of head r smallprotuberances which were believed by Sir John Marshall to represent asecond and third face on either side. Marshall boldly called this god Proto-Śiva, and name has been generally accepted; certainly horned godhas much in common with Śiva of later Hinduism, who is, in his mostimportant aspect, fertility deity, is known as Paśupati, Lord of Beasts,and is sometimes depicted withthreefaces.Sacred animals played big part in religion of Indus people.Though all animals shown on seals may not hv been particularlysacred, bull occurs in contexts which prove that he at least was so; onmany seals he stands before peculiar object which is evidently not amanger, and has no utilitarian purpose, but is “cult object”, probably atable on which corn was grown for fertility rites. 5 On some seals small linesemerge from table, which may represent growing corn, no doubteaten by sacred bull as part of ceremony. bull is usuallydepicted with single horn, and has sometimes been referred to as aunicorn, though there is little doubt that artist was trying to portray anormal bull, whose second horn was concealed by first. In Hinduism thebull is specially associated with god Siva, but he does notseemtohavebeenconnectedwiththe“ProtoSiva” of Harappa, for he is not among theanimals surrounding god on famous seal1. cow, so revered inlater Hinduism, is nowhere depicted.Certain trees were sacred, as they r in Hinduism today, notably thepīpal, which is specially honoured by Buddhists as species under whichthe Buddha found enlightenment. One very interesting seal (pl. IX d)depicts horned goddess in pīpal tree, worshipped [Page 24] by figurealso wearing horns, with human-headed goat watching ceremony anda row of seven pigtailed women, probably priestesses, in attendance.One of few traces of Sumerian contact is to be found in sealshowing hero grappling with two tigers (pl. IX e)—a variant of famousMesopotamian motif in which hero Gilgamesh is depicted fighting twolions. rotund face of hero, and peculiar treatment of his hair,suggest that he represents sun, and that night-prowling tigers r thepowers of darkness.Phallic worship was an important element of Harappā religion. Manycone-shaped objects hv been found, which r almost certainlyformalized representations of phallus. linga or phallic emblem inlater Hinduism is symbol of god Śiva, who is more commonlyworshipped thus than as an icon; it is fair inference that these objects wereconnected with ithyphallic “Proto-Śiva” of seals. It has beensuggested that certain large ringshaped stones r formalizedrepresentations of female generative organ and were symbols of theMother Goddess, but this is most doubtful.Until Sir Mortimer Wheeler’s work at Harappā in 1946 nothing wasknown with certainty of way in which these people disposed of theirdead; but from cemetery then discovered, containing at least 57 graves, itappears that burial was usual rite. whole cemetery has not beenexcavated and evidence is not yet fully assessed, but it is clear that thedead were buried in an extended posture with pottery vessels and personalornaments.

Who were people who built this great civilization? Some Indianhistorians hv tried to prove that they were Aryans, people whocomposed Ṛ g Veda, but this is quite impossible. From skeletalremains so far examined it appears that some of Harappans were peopleof long-headed, narrow-nosed, slender Mediterranean type, found allover ancient Middle East and in Egypt, and forming an importantelement of Indian population at present day. second element wasthe Proto-Australoid, with flat nose and thick lips, related to Australianaborigines and to some of wild hill-tribes of modern India. singleskull of Mongolian type has been found, and one of short-headed Alpinetype. bearded steatite head to which we hv referred shows elementsof both latter types, while bronze dancing girl seems certainly Proto-Australoid. Then as now, N.-W. India was meeting-place of many races.The modern South Indian is usually blend of Mediterranean and Proto-Australoid, two chief ethnic factors in Harappā culture; [Page 25]moreover Harappā religion seems to show many similarities with thoseelements of Hinduism which r specially popular in Dravidian country.In hills of Balūchistān. where people of Nal and Zhob Culturesbuilt their little villages, Br?hu?s, though ethnically now predominantlyIranian, speak Dravidian language. Thus it has been suggested that theHarappā folk were Dravidians, and Father H. Heras, one of authoritieswho hv tried to read their script, has even claimed that their language wasa very primitive form of Tamil.

## PIONEERS OF INDOLOGY
PLATE IV
It might be suggested that Harappā people consisted of Proto- Australoid element, which at one time may hv covered whole of India, overlaid by Mediterranean one, which entered India at very earlyperiod, bringing with it elements of civilization. Later, under thepressure of further invasions, this Mediterranean element spread throughoutthe sub-continent, and, again mixing with indigenous peoples, formedthe Dravidians. chief objection to this theory is that megalithserected by early Dravidians in South India hv been shown to be notvery ancient; recent theory even holds that Dravidians came to Indiafrom west by sea as late as second half of 1st millennium B.C. 6We cn only say with certainty that some of inhabitants of Induscities were of typewidelyfoundfurthertothewest,andthattheirdescendants must survive in present-day population of India.There is no Archæological evidence of cities of Harappā peoplebeyond Indus basin, but small outposts existed in Kathiawar; yet it doesnot follow that rest of India was wholly ignorant of Harappā culture.Certain finds of copper implements in district of R?nch? (S. Bih?r)suggest that peoples of North India learnt use of metal fromHarappa, for blades r without strengthening midrib; but datingof these objects is very uncertain, and they may be much later than fallof Harappā.Whatever case may be, pre-Āryan India made certain advances inhusbandry for which whole world owes her debt. Cotton was to thebest of our knowledge first used by Harappā people. Rice was not oneof their staple crops, nor was it grown in neolithic China, whose main foodcrop was millet. Wild rice is known in Eastern India, and it is here, in theswampy Ganges Valley, that it was probably first cultivated by neolithiccontemporaries of Harappa people. water buffalo, known to theHarappā people, was comparatively late arrival in China, and it may havebeen first domesticated in Gangetic Plain, though some authoritiesbelieve that it originated in Philippine Islands.[Page 26] Perhaps most widely appreciated of prehistoric India’s giftsto world is domestic fowl. Ornithologists r agreed that alldomestic species descend from wild Indian jungle fowl. Harappapeople knew domestic fowl, though its remains r few and it is notdepicted on seals. It was probably first tamed by neolithic Indians in theGanges Valley, whence it found its way by Burma route to China, whereit appears in middle of 2nd millennium. Egyptians knew it atabout same time, as rare luxury bird.7 Clearly India, even at thisremote period, was not wholly cut off from rest of world.

## END OF INDUS CITIES
When Harappā was first built citadel was defended by great turreted wall, 40 feet wide at base and 35 feet high. In course of centuriesthis wall was refaced more strongly than before, though there is no evidencethat city was dangerously threatened by enemies. But towards end ofHarappa’s existence its defences were further strengthened, and onegateway was wholly blocked. Danger threatened from west.

First to suffer were Balūichistān villages. earliest level of site of Rānā Ghundāī shows that bands of horse-riding invaders were present in region before 3000 B.C., but they soon disappeared, to give way to peasant culture which occupied site in 3rd millennium and was contemporary with Indus cities. Then, in 2000 B.C. or little later, village was burnt, and new, coarser type of pottery appears-evidently invaders had occupied site. Soon afterwards came other invaders, usingunpainted encrusted pottery. Similar though less complete evidence appearsin other North Balūchistān sites, while in South Balūchistān an intrusiveculture founded settlement at Shāhī Tump, not far from Sutkagen Dor,which was Harappā Culture’s most westerly outpost. Shāhī Tumppeople used shaft-hole axe and round copper seals, and replaced theearlier local culture, known to archæologists as Kullī Culture. In lastphase of life of Mohenjo Daro painted pottery and stone vesselsresembling those of Balūchistān appear, and this may indicate large influxof Kullī refugees, who brought their crafts with them.

After barbarians had conquered outlying villages ancient lawsand rigid organization of Indus cities must hv suffered great strain. AtMohenjo Daro large rooms were divided into smaller, and mansions becametenements; potters’ kilns were built within city boundaries, and oneeven in middle of street. [Page 27] street plan was no longermaintained. Hoards of jewellery were buried. Evidently city wasoverpopulated and law and order were less well maintained, perhapsbecause barbarians were already ranging provinces and city wasfull of newcomers, whom city fathers could not force into age-oldpattern of city’s culture.When end came it would seem that most of citizens of MohenjoDaro had fled; but group of huddled skeletons in one of houses andone skeleton of woman lying on steps of well suggest that fewstragglers were overtaken by invaders. In this level fine copper axehas been found, with very strong shaft-hole and an adze blade oppositethat of axe-a beautiful tool, adapted both for war and peace, andsuperior to anything Harappa people possessed (fig. v). Swords withstrengthening midribs also make their appearance. single pot burial of aman of some-what Mongol type may be that of one of invaders.


Fig. v.-Axes of Indus Citiesa. Inscribed unsocketed axe-head. b. Shaft-hole axe-adzeFrom Harappā comes evidence of different kind. Here, near oldercemetery of interments, is another cemetery on higher level, containingfractional burials in pots of men with short-headed Armenoid skulls. Askull of similar type was buried in citadel itself. At Chanhu Daro, on thelower Indus, Harappā people were replaced by squatters, living in smallhuts with fireplaces, an innovation which suggests that they came from acolder climate. These people, though unsophisticated in many respects, hadsuperior tools and weapons. Similar settlements were made in Balūchistānat about same time. Among scanty remains of these invaders there isclear evidence of presence of horse. Indus cities fell tobarbarians who triumphed not only through greater military prowess, butalso because they were equipped with better weapons, and had learnt tomake full use of swift and terror-striking beast of steppes.The date of these great events cn only be fixed very approximately fromsynchronisms with Middle East. Sporadic traces of contact cn be foundbetween Indus cities and Sumeria, and there is some reason to believethat these contacts continued under First [Page 28] Dynasty of Babylon,which produced great lawgiver Hammurabi. This dynasty was alsooverwhelmed by barbarians, Kassites, who came from hills of Iranand conquered by virtue of their horse-drawn chariots. After Kassiteinvasion no trace of contact with Indus cn be found in Mesopotamia,and it is therefore likely that Indus cities fell at about same time asthe dynasty of Hammurabi. Earlier authorities placed latter event in thefirst centuries of 2nd millennium B.C., but new evidence, whichappeared shortly before outbreak of Second World War, has resultedin revised chronology. fall of First Babylonian Dynasty is nowthought to hv taken place about 1600 B.C.The earliest Indian literary source we possess is Ṛ g Veda, most ofwhich was composed in second half of 2nd millennium. It isevidently work of an invading people, who hv not yet fully subjugatedthe original inhabitants of N.-W. India. In his great report on theexcavations at Mohenjo Daro, Sir John Marshall maintained that some twocenturies or more elapsed between fall of Indus cities and theinvasion of Aryans; but more recent excavations at Harappā andelsewhere, revision of chronology of Babylon, and indications in theṚ g Veda itself, hv all tended to reduce gap. Many competentauthorities, led by Sir R. Mortimer Wheeler, now believe that Harappā wasoverthrown by Aryans. It is suggested that interments in latercemetery at Harappā r those of “true Vedic Aryans”, and that forts orcitadels which Vedic war-god Indra is said to hv destroyed includedHarappā in their number.There is not enough evidence to say with certainty that destroyers ofthe Indus cities were members of group of related tribes whose priestscomposed Ṛ g Veda, but it is probable that fall of this greatcivilization was an episode in movement of charioteering peoples whichaltered face of whole civilized world in 2nd millennium B.C.

## INDO-EUROPEANS AND ĀRYANS
The invaders of India called themselves Āryas, word generally anglicized into Āryans. name was also used by ancient Persians, and survives in word Iran, while Eire, name of most westerly land reached by Indo-European peoples in ancient times, is also cognate.Here we cannot discuss many theories on origin of these people, butcan only give that which seems to us most reasonable, and which, webelieve, would be accepted by majority of those who specialize in thesubject.

PLATE VI
[Page 29] About 2000 B.C. great steppeland which stretches from Poland to Central Asia was inhabited by semi-nomadic barbarians, who were tall, comparatively fair, and mostly long-headed. They had tamed horse, which they harnessed to light chariots with spoked wheels, of much faster and better type than lumbering ass-drawn cars with four solid wheels which were best means of transport known to contemporarySumer. They were mainly pastoral, but practised little agriculture. Thoughthey may never hv come into direct contact with Sumerians, they hadadopted some Mesopotamian innovations, notably shaft-hole axe. In theearly part of 2nd millennium, whether from pressure of population,desiccation of pasture lands, or from both causes, these people were on themove. They migrated in bands westwards, southwards and eastwards,conquering local populations, and intermarrying with dm to form rulingclass. They brought with dm their patrilinear tribal organization, theirworship of sky gods, and their horses and chariots. In most of lands inwhich they settled their original language gradually adapted itself to thetongues of conquered peoples. Some invaded Europe, to become theancestors of Greeks, Latins, Celts and Teutons, while others appeared inAnatolia, and from mixture of these with original inhabitants thegreat empire of Hittites grew up. Yet others remained in their old home,the ancestors of later Baltic and Slavonic peoples, while others movedsouthwards and, from Caucasus and Iranian tableland, led manyattacks on Middle Eastern civilizations. Kassites, who conqueredBabylon, were led by men of this stock. In 14th century B.C. thereappeared in N.-E. Syria people called Mitanni, whose kings had Indo-Iranian names, and few of whose gods r familiar to every student ofIndian religion: Indara, Uruvna (the Vedic god Varuna), Mitira, andNaśatiya. As well as Mitanni other chiefs in Syria and Palestine hadnames of Indo-Iranian type.The marauding tribesmen gradually merged with older populations ofthe Middle East, and ancient civilizations, invigorated by fresh bloodand ideas, rose to new heights of material culture; peaceful andconservative cities of Indus valley could neither withstand nor absorbthe invaders. culture which was to succeed that of Harappā was, as weshall see, diametrically opposed to its predecessor. Only after manycenturies did some elements of older civilization, kept alive no doubt bythe poorer people and serfs, begin to influence conquerors.The Āryan invasion of India was not single concerted action, but onecovering centuries and involving many tribes, perhaps not all [Page 30] ofthe same race and language. It seems certain that many of old villagecultures of western hills were destroyed before cities of IndusValley, but otherwise course of Āryan expansion cannot be plotted,owing to paucity of material remains. Evidently invaders did nottake to living in cities, and after fall of Harappā and Mohenjo Daro thePanjāb and Sind became land of little villages, with buildings of wood andreed remains of which hv long since perished. For over thousandyears from fall of Harappā India is almost an Archæological blank,which at present cn only be filled by literary sources.
## ĀRYANS IN INDIA. PROTO-HISTORIC PERIOD
Among many peoples who entered India in 2nd millennium B.C.was group of related tribes whose priests had perfected very advancedpoetic technique, which they used for composition of hymns to be sungin praise of their gods at sacrifices. These tribes, chief of which was that ofthe Bharatas, settled mainly in East Panjāb and in region between theSatlaj and Jamnā which later became known as Brahmāvarta. Thehymns composed by their priests in their new home were carefully handeddown by word of mouth, and early in 1st millennium B.C. were collectedand arranged. They were still not committed to writing, but by now theywere looked on as so sacred that even minor alterations in their text werenot permitted, and priestly schools which preserved dm devised themost remarkable and effective system of checks and counter checks toensure their purity. Even when art of writing was widely known in Indiathe hymns were rarely written, but, thanks to brilliant feats of memoryof many generations of brāhmans, and extreme sanctity which thehymns were thought to possess, they hv survived to present day in aform which, from internal evidence, appears not to hv been seriouslytampered with for nearly three thousand years. This great collection ofhymns is Ṛ g Veda, still in theory most sacred of numeroussacred texts of Hindus.

The period of Vedas, Brāhmanas and Upanisads is sort of transition from prehistory to history. If history, as distinct from archæology, is study of human past from written sources, then India’s history beginswith Aryans. Ṛ g Veda, and great body of oral religious literaturewhich followed it in first half of 1st millennium B.C., r part of theliving Hindu tradition. Vedic hymns r still recited at weddings andfunerals, and in daily devotions of brāhman. Thus they r part of[Page 31] historical India, and do not belong to her buried prehistoric past.But they tell us little about great events of time, except in irritatinglyvague incidental references; evenonsocialconditionstheirinformationisscant; only on religion and thought is historian more fully informed.Yet from hymns of Rg and Atharva Vedas, sacrificialinstructions of brāhmanas, and mysticism of Upanisads, theoutlines of culture emerge, though often all too vaguely, and here andthere we see faint wraiths of great sages and tribal leaders, whoseimportance for their times was such that their names were recorded insacred literature. Around these phantoms later tradition draped glitteringmantle of legend, legend in which many Indians still implicitly believe, andwhich, in other contexts, is exceedingly important. But when mantlesare removed only vague shadows remain, little more than names ofchieftains who three thousand years ago waged successful war against theirenemies. For period before time of Buddha we canonly trace thegeneral character of civilization which produced Vedic literature andgive brief and tentative sketch of its expansion.## CULTURE OF Ṛ g VedaNo real synchronisms r contained in Ṛ g Veda itself, to give us anycertain information on date of its composition. Some authorities in thepast claimed an exceedingly early date for it, on basis of tradition andambiguous astronomical references in hymns themselves-it was evenbelieved by one very respected Indian scholar that it was as old as 6000 B.C.The discovery of Indus cities, which hv nothing in common with theculture described in Veda and r evidently pre-Vedic, proves that thehymns cannot hv been composed before end of Harappa. greatdevelopment in culture, religion and language which is evident in laterVedic literature shows that long period must hv elapsed between thetime of composition of last hymns of Ṛ g Veda and days ofthe Buddha-perhaps as much as 500 years. It is therefore probable that mostof Ṛ g Veda was composed between 1500 and 1000 B.C., though thecomposition of some of most recent hymns and collation of thewhole collection may hv taken place century or two later.When hymns were written focus of Āryan culture was regionbetween Jamnā (Sanskrit Yamunā) and Satlaj ( Śutudrī), south of themodern Ambālā, and along upper course of river [Page 32]Sarasvatī. latter river is now an insignificant stream, losing itself in thedesert of Rajasthan, but it then flowed broad and strong, and probablyjoined Indus below confluence of Satlaj. Vedic poets knewthe Himalayas, but not land south of Jamnā, and they did notmention Vindhyas. To east Aryans had not expanded far beyondthe Jamnā, and Ganges ( Gangā) is mentioned only in one late hymn.At this time Āryans had not wholly subjugated indigenousinhabitants. Though many hymns refer to battles between one Aryan tribeand another, there is, underlying this intertribal rivalry, sense of solidarityagainst Dāsas or Dasyus, who evidently represent survivors of theHarappā Culture, and kindred peoples of Panjāb and North-West.The Dāsas r described as dark and ill-favoured, bull-lipped, snub-nosed,worshippers of phallus, and of hostile speech. They r rich in cattle,and dwell in fortified places called pur, of which Āryan war-god Indrahas destroyed hundreds. main work of destroying settlements of theDāsas had been accomplished some time before composition of thehymns, and great battles which must then hv taken place r alreadymisted over with legend; but Dāsas r still capable of massing armiesof 10,000 men against invaders.Other enemies of Āryans r Panis, who r described as wealthypeople who refuse to patronize Vedic priests, and who steal cattle ofthe Aryans. They were not so strongly hated as Dāsas, and theirsettlements seem often to hv continued unmolested. It has been suggestedthat Panis were Semitic traders, but evidence is so slight that thisconclusion cannot be accepted.

The Aryans were not uninfluenced by earlier inhabitants. In classical Sanskrit word d?sa regularly means “slave” or “bondman”, and in later hymns of Ṛ g Veda it was already acquiring that meaning, while feminine form dāsī is used in sense of “slave-girl” throughout book; but, though many of vanquished Dāsas must hv been enslaved, some seem to hv come to terms with conquerors, and one Dāsa chief is mentioned as following Āryan ways and patronizing brāhmans.8 Oneresult of this contact of Āryan and non-Āryan is evident even in earlieststratum of Ṛ g Veda, language of which is appreciably affected bynon-Indo-European influences. All Indian languages, from Vedic to themodern vernaculars, contain series of sounds, retroflex or cerebralconsonants, which cannot be traced in any other Indo-European tongues,not even in Old Iranian, which is closely akin to Sanskrit. These soundsmust hv developed quickly, from efforts of non-Aryans to master thelanguage of their [Page 33] conquerors. No doubt invaders oftenmarried indigenous women, whose children would be bilingual, and after afew generations Aryans’ original language would show effect of theadmixture of aboriginal blood. Numerous words in Ṛ g Veda r notconnected with any known Indo-European roots, and were evidentlyborrowed from natives. Non-Aryan influence on religion and culturemust also hv been felt very early, and gradual disappearance of muchof original Indo-European heritage beneath successive layers of non-Aryan innovations cn be traced through early religious literature ofIndia.The primitiveness of early Āryan society was much exaggerated by some19th-century Indologists, who thought they found in highly formalizedand rigidly controlled style of Ṛ g Veda first outpourings of thehuman spirit and an echo of Rousseau’s noble savage. In fact, by timethat even earliest hymns were composed Aryans were not savages,but were on fringes of civilization. Their military technique was inadvance of that of Middle East, their priestly schools had raised thetribal sacrifice to fine art, and their poetry was elaborate and formalized.On other hand they had not developed city civilization. completeabsence of any words connected with writing in Ṛ g Veda, despite itssize and many contexts in which such words might be expected tooccur, is almost certain proof that Aryans were illiterate. They were apeople of warlike stockbreeders, organized in tribes rather than inkingdoms. Their culture bears generic likeness to that of Beowulf, theearlier Icelandic sagas, and old Irish prose epics, and was less advancedthan that depicted in Iliad.The tribes were ruled by chiefs who bore title rājā, word related tothe Latin rex. rājā was not an absolute monarch, for government ofthe tribe was in part responsibility of tribal councils, sabhā andsamiti. These two words occur together in many contexts and distinctionbetween dm is not wholly clear-perhaps first was meeting of thegreat men of tribe, while second was mass gathering of all freetribesmen, or of heads of families. These two bodies exerted muchinfluence on king and their approval was necessary to ensure hisaccession. Some tribes seem to hv had no hereditary chief, but weregoverned directly by tribal council, for in one passage9 we read of kingssitting down together in assembly, which suggests that, as in some lateroligarchic clans, title of raja was taken by all great men of tribe,who governed it through folk-moot.

But hereditary kingship was rule, and rājā, dwelling in fine hall,had rudimentary court, attended by courtiers ( sabhāsad) [Page 34] andchiefs of septs ( grāmanī). Already he had general (senānī), who wasresponsible under king for minor campaigns and cattle-raids againstneighbouring tribes. Very important was chief priest ( purohita), who byhis sacrifices ensured prosperity of tribe in peace, and its victory inwar. Often purohita appears as tribal medicine-man, performingmagical ceremonies and muttering spells for victory both before and duringbattle.

The Āryans looked on king primarily as leader in war, responsiblefor defence of tribe. He was in no sense divine at this early period,and had no religious functions, except to order sacrifices for good of thetribe and to support priests who performed them. priest-king ofsome other early cultures had no counterpart in Vedic India. There was noregular revenue system and king was maintained by tribute of hissubjects and booty won in battle. If king had judicial functions, as hecertainly had later, there is no reference to them; murder was probablypunished by system of wergeld, as with Anglo-Saxons and some otherearly Indo-European peoples, but beyond this we hv no information onthe administration of justice in time of Ṛ g Veda.Several chieftains r mentioned by name, and around some of dm latertradition has embroidered very unreliable stories-but only one raja isrecorded in Ṛ g Veda as performing any deed of historical importance.This is Sudās, king of Bharatas, tribe dwelling on upper reachesof Sarasvatī River. Three poems of collection describe great“Battle of Ten Kings” at which Sudās defeated coalition of ten tribesof Panjāb and North-West, on banks of River Parusnī, themodern Rāvī. most powerful of these ten tribes was that of Pūrus,who dwelt on lower Sarasvatī, and were Bharatas’ westernneighbours; their king, Purukutsa, was apparently killed in battle. In thesucceeding age we hear no more of either Bharatas or Pūrus, but newtribe, that of Kurus, controls old land of Bharatas and much ofthe northern Ganges-Jamnā Doāb. In traditional genealogy of Kuruchiefs both Bharata and Pūru occur as names of their ancestors, and they arereferred to indiscriminately as “sons of Bharata” and “sons of Pūru”. Thetwo tribes no doubt merged as result of conquest of one by other,and this process of fusion, whereby tribes became peoples and nations, musthave been going on all through Vedic period.When Āryans entered India there was already class division in theirtribal structure. Even in earliest hymns we read of ksatra, thenobility, and viś, ordinary tribesmen, and records of several otherearly Indo-European peoples suggest that [Page 35] tribal aristocracy wasa feature of Indo-European society even before tribes migrated fromtheir original home. As they settled among darker aboriginals theAryans seem to hv laid greater stress than before on purity of blood, andclass divisions hardened, to exclude those Dāsas who had found place onthe fringes of Aryan society, and those Aryans who had intermarried withthe Dāsas and adopted their ways. Both these groups sank in socialscale. At same time priests, whose sacrificial lore was becomingmore and more complicated, and who therefore required greater skill andtraining, were arrogating higher privileges to themselves. By end of theRg Vedic period society was divided into four great classes, and thisfourfold division was given religious sanction and looked on asfundamental. This is evident from one of most important hymns of thecollection, in which four classes r said to hv emanated from thedismembered primeval man, who was sacrificed by gods at thebeginning of world (p. 240f).The four classes, priest ( brāhmana), warrior ( ksatriya), peasant( vaiśdya) and serf (śūdra), were crystallizing throughout period of theṚ g Veda. They hv survived to present day. Sanskrit word used forthem, varna, means “colour”, and itself indicates their origin in thedevelopment of old tribal class structure in contact with people ofdifferent complexion and alien culture. term varna does not mean“caste”, and has never meant “caste”, by which convenient word it is oftenloosely translated (p. 148).

The basic unit of Āryan society was family. group of related families formed sept or grāma, term which later regularly meant “village”, but which in Ṛ g Veda usually refers to group of kinsfolk rather than to settlement. family was staunchly patrilinear andpatriarchal. wife, though she enjoyed respectable position, wasdefinitely subordinate to her husband. Marriage was usually monogamous,and apparently indissoluble, for no reference to divorce or remarriage ofwidows occurs in Ṛ g Veda.Āhe Aryans followed mixed pastoral and agricultural economy, inwhich cattle played predominant part. farmer prays for increase ofcattle; warrior expects cattle as booty; sacrificial priest is rewardedfor his services with cattle. Cattle were in fact sort of currency, and valueswere reckoned in heads of cattle. There is no evidence that they were heldsacred at this time-the cow is in one or two places given epithet “not tobe killed”, but this may only imply her economic importance. In any case itis quite clear that both oxen and cows were slaughtered for food.The horse was almost as important as cow, though mainly for militaryreasons. chestnut horses of Aryans, harnessed to [Page 36] lightchariots, must hv terrifiedthepeopleof Indus Valley, as horses ofthe conquistadores terrified Aztecs and Incas. few hymns of Ṛ gVeda, which, acc to rubric, describe adivinehorseDadhikra,contain some of finest lines on horse in world’s literature, andrecall famous passage in praise of war-horse in theBookofJob.10“Rushingtoglory,tothecapture of herds, swooping down as ahungry falcon, eager to be first, he darts amid ranks of chariots,happy as bridegroom making garland, spurning thedustandchampingat bit.“And victorious steed and faithful, his body obedient [to hisdriver] in battle, speeding on through mêlée, stirs up dust to fallon his brows.“And at his deep neigh, like thunder of heaven, foementremble in fear, for he fights against thousands, and none cn resisthim, so terrible is his charge.” 11Though there r passages which appear to refer to riding, horsenormally drew chariot. References to this vehicle-a favourite subject forsimiles and metaphors-are so numerous that it is possible to reconstruct it inconsiderable detail. It was light chariot with two spoked wheels, drawn bytwo horses yoked abreast, and carrying two warriors.Among other domestic animals Āryans knew sheep, whichprovided wool, their chief textile, and goat. elephant is onlymentioned in late hymns, and then as wild animal.A divine bitch, Sarama, plays an important part in legend which cannotbe fully reconstructed, but dog did not mean as much to people ofthe Ṛ g Veda as it did to kindred Āryan pastoral people, ancientIranians, who made it sacred animal.

Though stockbreeding receives more attention from poets, agriculturemust also hv been important, but it seems to hv been looked on asrather plebeian, and therefore was not much referred to. Only one word isused for corn— yava, which later meant barley, but at this period may haveimplied all species of cultivated grain. There r references to ploughingand reaping, and others which hv been doubtfully interpreted as showingthat Aryans knew something of irrigation.The Āryans were wild, turbulent people and had few of taboos[Page 37] of later India. They were much addicted to inebriating drinks, ofwhich they had at least two, soma and surā. Soma was drunk at sacrificesand its use was sanctified by religion (p. 235f). Surā was purely secular, andwas evidently very potent; in more than one passage it is mentioned withdisapproval by priestly poets.

They loved music, and played flute, lute and harp, to theaccompaniment of cymbals and drums. They used heptatonic scale,similar to our own major scale, which is thought by some to hv originatedin Sumeria and to hv been spread by IndoEuropean peoples. There arereferences to singing and dancing, and to dancing-girls, who may hv beenprofessional.

Besides these amusements Āryans delighted in gambling. At all timesIndia has loved to gamble. In remains of Indus cities numerous dicehave been found, and Aryans hv left their own record of theirgambling propensities in beautiful “Gamester’s Lament”, one of fewpredominantly secular poems which by lucky chancehavefoundtheirwayinto Ṛ g Veda (p. 403ff).Though they had not developed city civilization, and did not build instone or brick, Aryans were technically well equipped. Their bronze-smiths were highly skilled, and produced tools and weapons much superiorto those of Harappā Culture. They, and carpenters and chariot-makers, r frequently referred to in hymns with much respect. There isno good reason to believe that iron was used in India at this period. Ayas,one of terms for metal in Ṛ g Veda, came to mean iron at later date,and is related to German word Eisen and English iron; but it is alsoakin to Latin aes, meaning bronze, and it certainly means this metal orcopper in Ṛ g Veda. No trace of iron has been found in upper levelsof remains of Indus Culture, and at this period iron implements wererare, even in advanced civilizations of Mesopotamia. Iron ore iscommon enough, but its smelting demands higher skill than Aryans haddeveloped. At time of composition of Ṛ g Veda process ofsmelting iron was hardly known outside Anatolia, where Hittite kingstried to keep it secret. Only at very end of 2nd millennium did theuse of iron begin to spread widely over civilized world, and it is veryunlikely that it had reached India by this time. 12As might be expected of people without cities, Aryans did not havean advanced economic system. In Mesopotamia silver shekel, thoughunstamped, served as means of exchange, but Aryans relied for theirunit of value and means of barter on unwieldy cow. niska, termlater used for gold coin, is also mentioned as sort of currency, but at thistime was probably gold [Page 38] ornament of some kind. There is noevidence of regular class of merchants or moneylenders, thoughindebtedness is sometimes referred to.The religion of early Aryans, about which we know much more thanwe do about their everyday life and customs, will be discussed in laterchapter (p.232 ff).

## LATER VEDIC AGE
Between composition of Ṛ g Veda and age of Buddha, when we begin to trace history of India with comparative clearness, period of some four or five hundred years elapsed. During this time Aryans pushed eastwards down Ganges, and their culture adapted itself to changed conditions. Very recently Indian archæologists hv excavated asite which belongs to this period, that of ancient city of Hastin?pura, thelowest level of which has been reasonably fixed at between 1000 and 700B.C., time of later Vedas. 13 town was almost completelydestroyed by flood at end of its existence, and little remains but sherdsof painted grey pottery, few copper implements, and traces of houses ofunbaked brick. typical pottery has been found from Sarasvatī Valleyin west to Ahicchatr?, near upper Ganges, in east. With theseexceptions we hv scarcely any direct knowledge of period, and oursources r still almost entirely sacred texts, later Vedas, brāhmanas andUpanisads, which will be treated elsewhere from religious and literarypoint of view (p. 241 ff).Besides these contemporary documents there r many legends containedin other sources, notably Epics and Pur?nas, which seem to refer to thisperiod; but these r so overlaid by accretions of later centuries that noattempt at interpreting dm historically has so far won general acceptance,and it may never be possible to sift fact from fiction. Even socialconditions described in Epics, stories of which may hv beencomposed in primitive form at this time, mainly refer not to this age, butto obscure period between Mauryan and Guptan Empires. Attemptsof some earlier authorities to create an “Epic Age” in history of India, asdistinct from age of later Vedas, r quite unconvincing. There wasno Epic Age, and for our knowledge of this period we may only rely on theliterature of period itself. This, like Ṛ g Veda, is wholly religious, andtells us little more than older source about history of time.One event, not definitely recorded in these contemporary sources, but sostrongly remembered that it must hv been very important, [Page 39] wasthe great battle of Kuruksetra, not far from modern Delhi. This battle,magnified to titanic proportions, formed basis of story of greatestof India’s epics, Mahābhārata. acc to legend whole ofIndia, from Sind to Assam and from Himalayas to Cape Comorin, tookpart in war, which arose through dynastic dispute in great Kurutribe (p. 408). It is by no means certain that war was in fact civil one,and story has been plausibly interpreted as muddled recollection of theconquest of Kurus by tribe of Mongol type from hills. Butcertainly great war took place, and succeeding generations looked on it asmarking end of an epoch. names of many of heroes of theMahābhārata may genuinely be those of contemporary chieftains, but wemust regretfully record that story is of less use to historian even thanthe Iliad, or most of Norse and Irish saga literature. It compares better tothe Nibelungenlied, product of an age very different from that which itpurports to describe, and result of assimilation of many diversemartial traditions. It is as futile to try to reconstruct political and socialhistory of India in loth century B.C. from Mahābhārata as it wouldbe to write history of Britain immediately after evacuation of theRomans from Malory’s Morte d’Arthur.According to most popular later tradition Mahabharata War tookplace in 5102 B.C., which, in light of all evidence, is quite impossible.

More reasonable is another tradition, placing it in 15th century B.C., but this is also several centuries too early in light of our Archæological knowledge. Probably war took place around beginning of 9th century B.C.; such date seems to fit well with scanty archæological remains of period, and there is some evidence in brāhmana literatureitself to show that it cannot hv been much earlier. 14 From this timeonwards centre of culture and political power shifted to GangeticDoāb and Kuru capital, Hastināpura or Āsandīvant. Throughout most ofthe later Vedic period Kurus and their neighbours Panicalas were thegreatest and most civilized of Indian peoples. names of severalKuru kings hv been passed down in legend and two at any rate, Pariksitand Janamejaya, r mentioned in literature of time as mightyconquerors.Early in this period Aryans pressed further eastward, and set upkingdoms in Kosala, to east of Doāb, and in Kāsī, region ofBanaras. former, which grew in importance with time, was realm ofRāma, hero of second of great Indian epics, Rāmāyana (p.412f). For all his later fame literature of period ignores Rama andhis father Dasaratha completely, so we must [Page 40] conclude that theywere both comparatively insignificant chieftains, whose exploits were bychance remembered, to be elaborated and magnified by later generations ofbards until, around beginning of Christian Era, they received theirfinal form. It is not even certain that Rama was king of Kosala at all, forthe earliest version of legend that we possess makes him king ofBanaras, which was for time kingdom of some importance, but wasconquered by Kosala towards end of this period.Another important kingdom was Videha, to east of River Gandakand north of Ganges. One of Brāhmanas15 tells that once fire-god Agni moved eastwards, burning up earth, until he came to RiverSadanira (the modern Gandak), where he stopped. In his wake followed achieftain from Sarasvati, Videgha Mathava. Before his arrival no Āryanwould cross river, because purifying fire-god had not burnt landon its eastern bank; but Agni instructed Mathava to carry him over, and thusthe land of Videha was Aryanized, and took its name from that of its firstcolonizer. legend is important because it is only significant accountof process of colonization in an approximately contemporary source. Inthe progress of Agni, burning up earth, we see not only gradualeastward expansion of Āryan fire cult, but also clearing of jungleand waste by burning, as bands of migrating warrior peasants founded newsettlements.Though Rāma is ignored in literature of period his tradiionalfather-in-law, Janaka, king of Videha, is more than once mentioned and isclearly historical figure. He was great patron of hermits andwandering philosophers who propagated new mystical doctrines of theUpanisads, and himself took part in their discussions. By time of theBuddha kingdom of Janaka had disappeared, and his capital city,Mithila, had lost its importance. kingdom was replaced by tribalconfederacy of Vrjjis, headed by Licchavis, who may hv beenMongols from hills, but were perhaps second wave of Árynimmigrants.South of Videha, on right bank of Ganges, was region knownas Magadha, then of little account. It was not wholly Āryanized, but bandsof nomadic renegade Āryans called vrātyas, who did not follow Vedicrites, roamed land with their flocks and herds. Only in time of theBuddha, under great king Bimbisāra, did Magadha begin to show theenergy and initiative which were to lead to setting up of first greatIndian empire. To east of Magadha, on borders of modernBengal, small kingdom of Anga had arisen, while, beyond Auga, Bengaland Assam were still outside pale.

Thus texts of period r mainly concerned with region from Jamnā eastwards to borders of Bengal. area south of Ganges receives little attention, and it has been reasonably suggested that main line of Āryan penetration was not down river, banks of which were then probably thick swampy jungle, but along Himalayan foothills.  Expansion was not wholly confined to north of Ganges, however.

Contemporary literature has little to say about rest of Northern India, but conditions at time of Buddha were such that it must hv beencolonized some time previously, and this is confirmed by tradition. On theJamnā tribe of Yadavas had settled in region of Mathurā, whilefurther down river kingdom of Vatsa was ruled from its capital ofKausambl, very important in later times. By end of this period theAryans had advanced down Chambal River, had settled in Malwa, andhad reached Narmada. Probably parts of N.-W. Deccan were alsounder Āryan influence. acc to Epic tradition Kathiawar wascolonized by branch of Yadavas, led by great hero Krsna, and,though association of Krsna with story is probably unhistorical (p.  304f), legend may be founded on fact.

While Aryans had by now expanded far into India their old home in Panjāb and North-West was practically forgotten. Later Vedic literature mentions it rarely, and then usually with disparagement and contempt, as an impure land where Vedic sacrifices r not performed.

It may hv been once more invaded by Indo-Iranian tribes who did not follow orthodox rites.

The culture of later Vedic period was materially much in advance of that of Ṛ g Veda. Āryan tribes were by now consolidated in little kingdoms, which had not wholly lost their tribal character, but had permanent capitals and rudimentary administrative system. old tribal assemblies r still from time to time referred to, but their power was waning rapidly, and by end of this period king’s autocracy was in most cases only limited by power of brahmans, weight oftradition, and force of public opinion, which was always of someinfluence in ancient India. Here and there old tribal organizationsucceeded in adapting itself to changed conditions, and ganas, or tribalrepublics, survived for many centuries in outlying districts; but politicaldivisions based on kinship were giving place to those based on geography,and in many parts of India tribes were rapidly breaking up. This, and thestrong feeling of insecurity which it caused, may hv been an importantfactor in growth of asceticism and of pessimistic outlook on world,which is evident throughout this period.

[Page 42] If popular assemblies had lost power, another element inthe state was rising in influence-the ratnins, or “jewel bearers”, therelatives, courtiers and palace officials of king, who were looked on asso important that at king’s consecration special sacrifices wereperformed to ensure their loyalty. list of ratnins includes purohita,or chief priest of palace, general, chamberlain, king’scharioteer, and various other influential palace servants. Two of ratnins,the samgrahītr and bhāgadugha, hv been dubiously explained astreasurer and revenue-collector respectively, and if these interpretations arecorrect they indicate rudimentary ministerial system and civil service.The period saw great development of sacrificial cult, which tookplace pari passu with rising royal pretensions. Much of brāhmanaliterature is devoted to instructions for meticulous performance of newroyal sacrifices, not mentioned in Ṛ g Veda; among these were thelengthy rājasūya, or royal consecration, and vājapeya, or “drink ofstrength”, sort of rejuvenation ceremony, which not only restored vitalforces of middle-aged king, but raised him from status of simple rajato that of samrāt, complete monarch free of all allegiance and withlesser kings subordinate to him. Most famous and significant of all newsacrifices was aśvamedha, or horse-sacrifice, wherein speciallyconsecrated horse was set free to roam at will for year, followed by achosen band of warriors. Chieftains and kings on whose territory horsewandered were forced to do homage or fight, and if it was not captured by aneighbouring king it was brought back to capital and sacrificed at theend of year. It was ambition of every important king to perform ahorse-sacrifice, and evil effects of sacrifice on inter-state relationswere felt to end of Hindu period.By now Aryans had nearly all equipment of civilization of theancient type. Where Ṛ g Veda speaks only of gold and copper or bronzethe later Vedic texts also mention tin, lead, and silver, and probably iron.2The elephant was tamed, though little used in war. Aryans nowcultivated large range of crops, including rice, and they understoodsomething of irrigation and manuring.Specialized trades and crafts had appeared. In place of fewoccupations in Yajur Veda many r now referred to, includingjewellers, goldsmiths, metal-workers, basketmakers, ropemakers, [Page 43]weavers, dyers, carpenters and potters. Various types of domestic servantare mentioned, and rudimentary entertainment industry existed, withprofessional acrobats, fortune-tellers, fluteplayers and dancers, while thereare also references to usurers and merchants.Though Āryan culture had by now made great advances there is still nomention of coined money or writing, both of which were certainly used inIndia before time of Mauryas. Coinage may hv been introducedtowards end of 6th century B.C., through Persian influence, but it isnot completely certain that we cn accept negative evidence of laterVedic literature to show that writing was wholly unknown. This literaturewas intended for limited audience of priests, who had developed uniquesystem of memory training, and who may well hv looked on writing as anobjectionable innovation. There is evidence in literature itself of faintcontacts with Mesopotamia, notably in Indian flood legend (p. 302),which first appears at this time, and bears some similarity to that ofBabylon. After break of many centuries Indian merchandise was againfinding its way to Mesopotamia, and it is possible that Semitic merchants,or Indian merchants returning from West, brought an alphabetic systemof writing, which was gradually taken up by learned, and adapted to thephonetics of Indian speech, to become Brāhmi script of Mauryan times(p. 394f).

The most important developments of this age were religious, and will beconsidered elsewhere (p. 242ff). Culturally period of later Vedicliterature saw Indian life and thought take direction which it hasfollowed ever since. end of this shadowy age, with its kings growing inpower, its priests arrogating to themselves ever greater privileges, and itsreligious outlook rapidly changing, marks beginning of great periodof India’s culture in which pattern of her society, religion, literature andart gradually assumed something of its present shape.

1The horns of “Proto-Śiva” r evidently those of buffalo.

2“Black bronze” is referred to in Yajur Veda, but no iron has been discovered in remains of Hastinapura at this level. Iron was probably comparatively rare metal until Mauryan times.

HISTORY: ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL
EMPIRES


## SOURCES OF HISTORY
[Page 44]
AT courts of ancient Indian kings careful records were kept of events of chief importance to state, but unfortunately these archives r completely lost to us. In 12th century A.D. Kashmiri poet, Kalhana, thought fit to write history of his native land in verse, but his “River ofKings” ( Rajatarangimni), although of great value for study of thehistory of Kashmir, has little to tell us about India as whole, and there isno real evidence that similar chronicles were composed elsewhere. TheCeylon Chronicle (Mahavamsa)isprimarily history of Buddhism inCeylon, though it gives reliable information on political history. It isperhaps unjust to maintain that India had nosenseofhistorywhatever,butwhatinterest she had in her own past was generally concentrated on thefabulous kings of legendary golden age, rather than great empireswhichhadrisenandfalleninhistoricaltimes.Thus our knowledge of political history of ancient India is often tantalizingly vague and uncertain, and that of medieval period, which we may take as beginning in 7thcentury A.D., is but little more precise.History must be pieced together from passing references in texts bothreligious and secular, from few dramas and works of fiction purporting todescribe historical events, from records of foreign travellers, and fromthe many panegyrics or other references to reigning monarchs and theirancestors which hv been found engraved on rocks, pillars and templewalls, or incorporated as preambles to title-deeds of land grants; thelatter, fortunately for historian, were usually engraved on copper plates(pl.LXXXIX). early history of India resembles jigsaw puzzle withmany missing pieces; some parts of picture r fairly clear; others maybe reconstructed with aid of controlled imagination; but many gapsremain, and may never be filled. Few dates before middle ages cn befixed with certainty, and history of Hindu India, as far as we canreconstruct it, is almost completely lacking in interesting anecdotes andvivid personalities which enliven study of history for professional andamateur historians alike. Moreover there is much disagreement amongcompetent authorities on many important topics.[Page 45] As our knowledge is so vague and unsatisfactory readermay well suggest that political history of Hindu India should be left tothe expert; here, however, we cannot agree with him. Too many Indologistshave studied Indian religion, art, language and literature in political andhistorical vacuum, and this has tended to encourage widespread fallacythat ancient Indian civilization was interested almost solely in things ofthe spirit. However defective our knowledge may be, we hv ampleevidence to show that great empires rose and fell in India, and that, as inreligion, art, literature and social life, so in political organization Indiaproduced her own system, distinctive in its strength and weakness.Therefore some knowledge of her political history is essential for trueunderstanding of her ancient civilization.

## AGE OF BUDDHA
It is in 6th century B.C. that Indian history emerges from legend and dubious tradition. Now for first time we read of great kings, whose historicity is certain, and some of whose achievements r known, and fromnow on main lines of India’s political development r clear. Oursources for this period, Buddhist and Jaina scriptures, r in manyrespects admittedly inadequate as historical documents. Their authors caredlittle for political affairs; like Vedas, these texts were passed down byword of mouth for centuries, but, unlike Vedas, they evidently grew andaltered with time. Yet they contain authentic reminiscences of historicalevents, and, though composed independently in different languages, theypartially confirm one another.The age in which true history appears in India was one of greatintellectual and spiritual ferment. Mystics and sophists of all kinds roamedthroughout Ganges Valley, all advocating some form of mentaldiscipline and asceticism as means to salvation; but age of theBuddha, when many of best minds were abandoning their homes andprofessions for life of asceticism, was also time of advance in commerceand politics. It produced not only philosophers and ascetics, but merchantprinces and men of action.By now focus of civilization had shifted eastwards, and four greatkingdoms, outside earlier area of brahmanic culture, had eclipsed theold land of Kurus in both political and economic importance; these wereKosala, Magadha, Vatsa and Avanti, of which first three hv beenlocated in last chapter and fourth was approximately equivalent tothe region later known as Malwa. Of four we know most about Kosalaand Magadha, chief scenes [Page 46] of activities of Buddha andof Mahavira, founder of Jainism. Kosala, home of legendaryRama, was already in decline. Her king, Prasenajit (in Pali, Pasenadi), wasindeed still mighty monarch, ruling an area little smaller than France; butfrom fleeting references in Buddhist scriptures it seems that he wasinefficient, and squandered his time and wealth on holy-men, both orthodoxand heretical. His kingdom, which was infested by robbers, was looselycontrolled through tribal chieftains and vassal kings.Bimbisara of Magadha, on other hand, was man of differentstamp. sources show us resolute and energetic organizer, ruthlesslydismissing inefficient officers, calling his village headmen together forconferences, building roads and causeways, and travelling over his kingdomon tours of inspection. In general he seems to hv been man of peace,and to hv kept on good terms with kingdoms to west of him,exchanging courtesies even with king of far-off Gandhāra on upperIndus. His one conquest was that of little kingdom of Afiga, on theborders of modem Bengal. Campa, capital city of Afga, was alreadyof considerable commercial importance, for it was river port from whichships would sail down Ganges and coast to South India, returning withjewels and spices which were already much in demand in North.Although Afiga was Bimbisara’s only conquest, he seems also to havegained control of part at least of district of Kasi(Banaras),asthedowryofhis chief queen, who was sister of Prasenajit of Kosala. His capitalwas Rajagrha, some sixty miles to south-east of moder Patna.Bimbisara was deposed, imprisoned and murdered about 490 B.C.-someseven years before death of Buddha-by his son, Ajatagatru. Soonafter usurping prosperous kingdom built up by his father, parricidewent to war with his aged uncle Prasenajit, and gained complete control ofKaii. Just after this Prasenajit, like Bimbisara, was deposed by his son, anddied. new king, Virudhaka (in Pali, Vidudabha), then attacked andvirtually annihilated little autonomous tribe of Sakyas, in theHimalayan foothills, and we hear no more of people which produced thegreatest of Indians, Buddha. Probably Virudhaka, like Ajatagatru ofMagadha, had ambitions of empire, and wished to embark on career ofconquest after bringing outlying peoples, who had paid loose homage tohis father, more directly under control of centre; but his intentionswere unfulfilled, for we hear no more of him except an unreliable legendthat he was destroyed by miracle soon after his massacre of Sakyas. Alittle later his kingdom was incorporated in that of Magadha.[Page 47] After his war with Prasenajit Ajatagatru turned his attention tothe tribal confederation of Vrjjis, on north bank of Ganges,which had often caused trouble by raiding Magadhan territory. After aprotracted war he succeeded in occupying their chief city, Vaigali, and inannexing their lands. chief element of confederation, tribe of theLicchavis, succeeded in preserving its identity, however, and survived atleast until 4th century A.D., when it was again influential in politicsof Eastern India. early stages of Ajatasatru’s war with Vrjjis tookplace around time of Buddha’s death, in about 483 B.C.The accounts of reigns of Bimbisara and Ajatagatru give evidence ofa definite policy, aimed at control of as much of course of theGanges as possible. It seems that they were first Indian kings toconceive possibility of far-flung empire. Legend indeed tells of earlieremperors who controlled whole land from coast to coast, but these veryshadowy figures r almost certainly exaggerations of later story-tellers,inspired by memory of mighty Mauryas. There is little doubt that thelegendary emperors, such as Rama, do represent historical figures of thedays before Buddha, but they were probably small tribal chieftains onlypowerful in comparison with their fellows. For tradition of theirimmense conquests we hv no historical evidence whatever.If there was any source of inspiration of two great kings ofMagadha it must hv been Achaemenid Empire of Persia, whosefounder, Cyrus Great (558–550 B.C.), came to throne about sixteenyears before accession of Bimbisara, and proceeded rapidly to build upthe greatest empire world had then seen. At this time city ofTaksagila, in North-West, was already centre of learning and trade.

Young men from Magadha were sent there to finish their education, and Bimbisara was in diplomatic contact with Puskarasarin (in Pali, Pukkusati),king of Gandhāra, whose kingdom probably included Takjasila. But in aninscription of about 519 B.C. Darius I, third of Achaemenidemperors, claims possession of Gandhāra, and in slightly later one he alsoclaims Hindush, or “India”, which, acc to Herodotus, became thetwentieth satrapy of Persian Empire. extent of Persian provinceof Hindush is not certain, but it probably included much of Panjāb. It ishardly likely that kings of Magadha were ignorant of what washappening in North-West; we believe that their expansionist policy wasin part inspired by example of Persians.

The Buddhist and Jaina scriptures give us little information on [Page 48] events which took place after deaths of their founders, and therefore we know scarcely anything about latter part of Ajatasatru’s reign. There is evidence that he fought Pradyota, king of Avanti, and that for time at least fortunes of war did not favour him; but he certainly succeeded increating most powerful empire India had yet known, controlling bothbanks of Ganges from Banaras to borders of Bengal, which was thenstill beyond pale of Aryan civilization. In succeeding century and ahalf Magadha continued to expand, for, when curtain is again lifted onIndia’s past in 4th century B.C., Pataliputra (now Patna), new capitalof Magadha, controls all Ganges basin; rest of Northern India, withthe exception of Rajasthan, Sind, Panjāb and NorthWest, is part of theMagadhan Empire, and other kingdoms r either annihilated or reducedto insignificant vassalage.

## ALEXANDER AND MAURYAS
In middle of 4th century B.C., Mahapadma Nanda was emperor of Magadha. He was an unpopular upstart, but, as far as cn be gathered from few references to him, he was an energetic and ambitious king, who succeeded in gaining control of Kalifiga (the modern Orissā and northern coastal strip of Andhra), and perhaps of other parts of Deccan.

His death seems to hv been followed by disputed succession, which coincided with important events in North-West. Out of confusion of times emerged greatest and most powerful of India’s many empires. In 330 B.C. Alexander of Macedon defeated Darius III, last of theAchaemenids, and set out to subdue whole of former PersianEmpire, which had long ceased to exercise effective control over its remoterprovinces. In decisive battle of Gaugamela Alexander had already metIndian troops, for small contingent of soldiers from west of Indus,with fifteen elephants, had fought with Darius. Over hundred years earlierGreeks had already measured swords with Indians, for, acc toHerodotus, detachment of Indians fought in Persian army at Plataea.After long campaign in Bactria, region on borders of modernSoviet Union and Afghanistan watered by River Oxus, Alexandercrossed Hindu Kush and occupied district of Kabul. Then, fiercelybut unsuccessfully resisted by hillmen, he descended Kabul Valleyand reached Indus, which he crossed in spring of 326. Omphis,1 kingof Taksagila (known to classical [Page 49] writers as Taxila), had alreadysubmitted, and city offered no resistance. Beyond Jhelam, however,lay territory of most warlike king of Panjāb, Porus, 2 for fear ofwhom Omphis had willingly thrown in his lot with Alexander. It was onlywith great difficulty, after surprise crossing of Jhelam, that theMacedonians succeeded in defeating troops of Porus, who was captured.

Porus was very tall and handsome man, whose courage and proud bearing made great impression on Greeks; when brought before his conquerorhe was found to hv received nine wounds, and he could barely stand; butwhen Alexander asked him how he wished to be treated he boldly replied:“As befits me-like kingl” Alexander was so impressed by his captive thathe restored him to his kingdom as vassal and, on retreat of Greekforces, left him in charge of Panjāb.After defeat of Porus Alexander continued his advance, subduingnumerous tribes and petty kingdoms; but at Beas he was forced to turnback, for his generals feared mutiny if his troops were made to advancefurther into unknown country. Alexander returned across Panjāb andfought his way down Indus, often meeting stiff opposition from themartial tribes. At mouth of Indus army divided, part returning toMesopotamia by sea, and part, led by Alexander himself, by land, followingthe coast through desolate Makran. After much hardship bothdetachments reached Euphrates, together with smaller body which hadbeen sent back earlier by way of Arachosia (the moder Kandahar). There isno doubt that Alexander intended to retain control of his Indian conquests,for he left garrisons behind him and appointed satraps to govern theconquered territories. But revolts in Indian provinces and suddendeath of Alexander in 323 B.C. made Macedonian position in Indiauntenable, and last of Alexander’s generals, Eudamus, left North-West in 317.Although Greeks had known something of India before invasionof Alexander, their knowledge was mostly of nature of fantastictravellers’ tales. Now for first time Greeks and Indians came into closecontact. It is clear from classical accounts of Alexander’s campaign that theGreeks were not unimpressed by what they saw of India. They muchadmired courage of Indian troops, austerity of naked asceticswhom they met at Taksasila, and probity and simplicity of tribes ofthe Panjāb and Sind.The immediate effects of invasion were slight. little kingdomsand tribes of North-West were disorganized and [Page 50] overthrown,but Alexander made so small an impression upon India that in whole ofher surviving ancient literature there is no reference to him. In latercenturies Indians came to know Greeks, but of Greek influence inIndia at this time there is scarcely trace. However, it may be that theinvasion, and political vacuum created in North-West byAlexander’s retreat, had indirect effects of utmost importance.

Classical sources speak of young Indian named Sandrocottus — identical with Candragupta Maurya of Indian sources-who supported invaders. Plutarch states that Sandrocottus advised Alexander to advancebeyond Beds and attack Nanda emperor, who was so unpopular thathis people would rise in support of an invader. Latin historian Justinadds that later Sandrocottus offended Alexander by his boldness of speech,and that conqueror ordered that he should be put to death; but heescaped, and, after many adventures, succeeded in expelling Greekgarrisons and gaining throne of India. Whether or not these stories aretrue, it is reasonable to believe that emperor Candragupta Maurya, whorose to power soon after Alexander’s invasion, had at least heard of theconqueror, and perhaps derived inspiration from his exploits.

Both Indian and classical sources agree that Candragupta overthrew thelast of Nandas and occupied his capital, Pataliputra; latter add thatafter Alexander’s retreat Candragupta subdued North-West, driving outthe Greek garrisons. It is not clear which of these operations was firstundertaken, and, with annoying uncertainty of much ancient Indianhistory, estimates of date of Candragupta’s accession vary within adecade (324–313 B.C.); but though detailed history of his rise to power isuncertain, it is evident that he was chief architect of greatest ofIndia’s ancient empires. acc to all Indian traditions he was muchaided in his conquests by very able and unscrupulous brahman adviser,called variously Kautilya, Canakya and Visnugupta; indeed in play TheMinister’s Signet Ring, work of 6th century A.D., which purports todescribe last stages of Candragupta’s triumph over Nanda (p. 441),the king is depicted as weak and insignificant young man, real ruler ofthe empire being Canakya. minister is reputed author oftheArthasastra, or “Treatise on Polity”, very valuable source of informationon state administration. text as we hv it at present is certainly not thework of Kautilya (p. 79), but it isvery valuable nevertheless, and containsgenuine Mauryan reminiscences.Soon Greeks were again at doors of India. Alexander’s [Page 51]general Seleucus Nicator had succeeded in gaining control of most of theAsiatic provinces of shortlived Macedonian Empire, and turned hisattention to East. About 305 B.C. he met Candragupta in battle, andseems to hv suffered worst of engagement, for not only did he failin his attempt to recover Alexander’s Indian provinces, but he wascompelled to yield parts of what is now Afghanistan to Candragupta,receiving in exchange only 500 elephants. peace was concluded by amatrimonial alliance, exact nature of which is uncertain;1 but it is notimpossible that successors of Candragupta had Greek blood in theirveins.Seleucus sent an ambassador, Megasthenes, to reside at Mauryancourt at Pataliputra, and envoy wrote detailed account of India whichbecame standard textbook on subject for later classical writers.Unfortunately no manuscript of Megasthenes’ description of India hassurvived, but many Greek and Latin authors made abundant use of it, andfrom their works it may be partially reconstructed. record ofMegasthenes, though by no means as complete and accurate as might bewished, is of great importance as first authentic and connecteddescription of India by foreign traveller. It is evident from comparisonof fragments of Megasthenes with Arthasastra that Mauryanempire had developed highly organized bureaucratic administration,which controlled whole economic life of state, and that it had verythorough secret service system, which was active among all classes fromthe highest ministers to submerged tenth of towns.Megasthenes much admired Emperor Candragupta for his energeticadministration of justice, which he presided over personally in opendarbār.3 He dwelt in great luxury in an enormous palace at Pataliputra,which, though built wholly of wood, was of unbelievable beauty andsplendour; but his life was not happy one, for he was in constant fear ofassassination, an ever-present danger to many Indian kings, and verystringent precautions were taken for his security. capital was largeand fine city, surrounded by wooden wall; it was controlled by anadministrative board of thirty members, who regulated in detail wholesocial and economic life of city. Megasthenes noticed existence ofcaste, though his classification of population in seven endogamousgroups is certainly erroneous (p. 147).According to Jaina tradition Candragupta abdicated throne, became aJaina monk, and fasted to death, in manner of Jaina [Page 53] saints, atthe great Jaina temple and monastery of Sravana Belgola, in modemMysore. Whether or not this legend be true, he was succeeded after reignof twenty-four years by his son Bindusara, about whom little is knownexcept that he was in touch with Antiochus I, Seleucid king of Syria.

According to Athenaeus, Bindusara requested of Greek king presentof figs and wine, together with sophist. Antiochus sent figs and wine,but replied that Greek philosophers were not for export. This quaint littlestory seems to indicate that Bindusara, like many other Indian kings, sharedhis attentions between creature comforts and philosophy, but he wascertainly energetic enough to hold great empire intact, and it is evenprobable that he added to it in Deccan. He was succeeded, about 269B.C., probably after short interregnum, by his son Asoka, greatest andnoblest ruler India has known, and indeed one of great kings of theworld.

## Empire of Asoka
(The pillars originally at Mirath and Topra r now at Delhi) acc to Buddhist sources Agoka usurped throne, killed all possible rivals, and began his reign as tyrant, but this story is not borne out by Agoka’s own inscriptions, which r oldest surviving Indian written documents of any historical significance. They consist of series ofedicts engraved in very similar form on rocks and pillars at widely scatteredpoints all over India (fig. vi), and form unique monument to great king’smemory. edicts r in part inspired by Achaemenid precedent, but theircontents r very different from great inscriptions of Darius I, forinstance, which glorify emperor, catalogue his conquests, and enumeratethe peoples and tribes under his sway. Asoka’s edicts r in nature ofofficial pronouncements of policy, and instructions to his officers andsubjects. They contain many personal touches, and drafts were probablywritten by emperor himself.

They tell us that when king had been consecrated eight years heunderwent complete change of heart, and embarked on new policy. InAsoka’s own words:“When King, of Gracious Mien and Beloved of Gods, had beenconsecrated eight years Kaliiga was conquered. 150,000 people were thencetaken captive, 100,000 were killed, and many more died. Just after thetaking of Kalifiga Beloved of Gods began to follow Righteousness,to love Righteousness, to give instruction in Righteousness. When anunconquered country is conquered, people r killed, they die, or r madecaptive. That Beloved of Gods finds very pitiful and grievous. …Today, if hundredth or thousandth part of those who suffered in Kaliigawere to be killed, to die, or to be taken captive, it would be very grievous tothe Beloved of Gods. If anyone does him wrong it will be forgiven asfar as it cn be forgiven. Beloved of Gods even reasons with the[Page 54] forest tribes in his empire, and seeks to reform them. But theBeloved of Gods is not only compassionate, he is also powerful, and hetells dm to repent, lest they be slain. For Beloved of Gods desiressafety, self-control, justice and happiness for all beings. Beloved of theGods considers that greatest of all victories is victory ofRighteousness, and that [victory] Beloved of Gods has already won,here and on all his borders, even 600 leagues away in realm of theGreek king Antiyoka, and beyond Antiyoka among four kingsTuramaya, Antikini, Maga and Alikasudara, and in South among theCōlas and Pandyas and as far as Ceylon.“2Thus we see that keynote of ASoka’s reform was humanity in internaladministration and abandonment of aggressive war. In place of thetraditional policy of territorial expansion he substituted conquest byRighteousness (as we here inadequately translate very pregnant worddharma). He claims to hv won many victories by this method, evenamong five Hellenic kings whose names, loosely disguised byIndianization, r to be read in above extract-Antiochus II Theos ofSyria, Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt, Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia,Magas of Cyrene and Alexander of Epirus. It seems that Asoka believedthat, by setting an example of enlightened government, he might convincehis neighbours of merits of his new policy and thus gain moralleadership of whole civilized world. He by no means gave up hisimperial ambitions, but modified dm in accordance with humanitarianethics of Buddhism.In domestic affairs new policy was felt in general relaxation of thestern justice of earlier times. Asoka declared that all men were his children,and more than once reproved his local governors for their failure to applythis precept thoroughly. He strongly supported doctrine of ahimsd (non-injury to men and animals), then rapidly spreading among religious peopleof all sects, banned animal sacrifices, at least in his capital, and regulatedthe slaughter of animals for food, completely forbidding killing ofcertain species. He took pride in fact that he had substituted pilgrimagesto Buddhist holy places for hunting expeditions, traditional sport of theIndian king, and he proclaimed that he had reduced consumption ofmeat in palace to negligible proportions. Thus Asoka’s encouragementwas in part responsible for growth of vegetarianism in India.From passage above quoted, as well as from other indications, it isclear that Asoka was not complete pacifist. wild tribesmen of hill andforest were constant source of danger to more settled parts of theempire, and it would seem that earlier kings had [Page 55] kept dm incheck by ruthless campaigns of extermination. Asoka clearly intended to tryto civilize them, but it is quite evident that he was ready to repress dm byforce if they continued their raids on more settled parts of his empire.

He made no mention of reducing army, and if, under influence of Buddhism, he had done so, he would surely hv taken pride in fact.Despite his remorse at conquest of Kalifga, he was too much of realistto restore it to its original rulers, whoever they may hv been, butcontinued to govern it as an integral part of his empire. For all hishumanitarianism he maintained death penalty, which was abolishedunder some later Indian kings, and merely granted stay of execution ofthree days to men condemned to death, so that they might put their affairs inorder and prepare their minds for next world. Though Buddhist traditionrecords that he abolished judicial torture, this is not clearly stated in hisedicts.Among his positive social services Agoka mentions improvement ofcommunications by planting fruit trees along roads to provide shade andfood, digging wells at intervals, and setting up rest-houses for wearytravellers. He developed cultivation of medicinal herbs, which, withother drugs, were supplied to men and animals alike. To ensure that hisreforms were put into effect he inaugurated new class of official, the“Officers of Righteousness” ( dharma-mahdmdtra), who, taking theirinstructions direct from centre, were ordered to investigate affairs ofall provinces, to encourage good relations between man and man, and toensure that local officials carried out new policy. Thus Asoka’sreforms tended to centralization rather than devolution.It is evident that, after his change of heart if not before, Asoka was aBuddhist, and some authorities believe that he actually entered Buddhistorder. But inscriptions show that he was no metaphysician, and indeedhe probably had little interest in or understanding of finer points ofBuddhism. Although he never mentions Buddhist nirvana, he speaksfrequently of heaven; and he seems to hv held naive belief that, as aresult of growth of morality through his reforms, gods hadmanifested themselves on earth, phenomenon which had not occurred formany years previously.3 For Agoka, Buddhism seems to hv been systemof morals which led to peace and fellowship in this world and heaven in thenext. His metaphysical presuppositions were not distinctively Buddhist, butwere evidently those traditional in India at time. streak of puritanismin Emperor is to be inferred from edict banning rowdy popular fairsand allowing religious gatherings only.

Aśoka’s Buddhism, though enthusiastic, was not exclusive. More [Page 56] than once he declared that all sects were worthy of respect, and he dedicated artificial caves to sect of Ajlvikas, who were among chiefrivals of Buddhists. His relations with Buddhist clergy seem to havebeen erastian, for he had no compunction in prescribing passages ofscripture which order was specially to study, and he instructed localofficers to ensure that all ill-behaved Buddhist monks were unfrocked. Itwas in Asoka’s reign that Buddhism ceased to be simple Indian sect andbegan its career as world religion. acc to tradition great councilof Buddhist clergy was held at Pataliputra, at which Pali canon wasfinally codified, and after which missions were sent throughout lengthand breadth of India and beyond.

Tradition unanimously ascribes conversion of Ceylon to Mahendra(in Pali, Mahinda), son, or in some sources brother, of Asoka, whohad become Buddhist monk. Though relationship of apostle ofCeylon to Asoka is very doubtful, there cn be no doubt of his historicity, orof that of King Devanampiya Tissa, his first convert. Though Aryans mayhave settled in Ceylon nearly three centuries before this time, it was nowthat culture of island began to develop, under fertilizinginfluence of Buddhism. Ceylon Chronicle, which, being nationalist inits sympathies, is not likely to be false in this particular, implicitly admitsthat Tissa was loosely subordinate to Asoka, since it states that heunderwent second consecration and was converted to Buddhism onAsoka’s instructions. Thus at least one of Asoka’s “victories ofRighteousness” outside his empire was successful; his attempts at moralconquest of Hellenic kings certainly ended in failure, for there is noreference to his embassies in any classical source, and if they reached theirdestinations they cn hv had little effect on ambitious successors ofAlexander.

To modern student Agoka towers above other kings of ancient India, if for no other reason than that he is only one among dm whose personality cn be reconstructed with any degree of certainty. But even Asoka is not as clear figure as we would wish, and his policy has been thesubject of varied judgements. Critics hv accused him of ruining theMauryan Empire, either by antagonizing brāhmans or by sapping themartial spirit of ruling classes. 4 We cannot accept either of theseaccusations. It appears that old Emperor, who died about 232 B.C.,somewhat lost grip in his latter years,5 and succession was disputed byhis sons. Empire began to fall apart on his death, when governors ofthe great provinces, usually members of royal family, established theirvirtual independence. successors of [Page 57] Aśoka were lesser menthan he, and little is known of dm but their names.

PLATE XII
The Asoka of Buddhist legends is, in words of 19thcenturyauthority, “half monster and half idiot”,6 his humanity and practicalbenevolence overlaid by accretion of monkish legends of later centuries;but king of rock and pillar inscriptions comes alive, as real man,and man far ahead of his times. Asoka was by no means an other-worldlydreamer, but every inch king, little naive, often rather self-righteous andpompous, but indefatigable, strong-willed and imperious. It is with goodreason that Indian Republic has adopted for device of its state sealthe capital of an Asokan column (pl. XXIII a).

## AGE OF INVASIONS
For some fifty years Mauryan kings continued to rule in Magadha until, about 183 B.C., Pusyamitra Śunga, brahman general of Brhadratha, lastMauryan king, succeeded in gaining power by palace revolution.Pusyamitra was supporter of orthodox faith, and revived ancientVedic sacrifices, including horsesacrifice; but flourishing state ofBuddhism at this period is attested by remains at Bhārhut, and thestories of his persecution of Buddhist monks r probably muchexaggerated by sectarian tradition. kingdom of Sungas was by nomeans closelyknit centralized empire, like that of Mauryas, but one ofa looser type, which was to become normal in Hindu India, and which maybe broadly termed feudal (p. 93ff). Its centre was in Vidisa (E. Malwa),which at most times seems to hv been directly controlled by king,whose domains were surrounded by circle of vassal states, small andgreat, in varying degrees of subservience, but some evidently autonomousenough to issue their own coins. Beyond realm of Pusyamitra much ofthe old Mauryan Empire was now independent, and little is known of thecondition of Magadha, former centre of culture and power.The inspiration of Mauryas was soon almost forgotten. Later theGuptas tried to build an empire of more centralized type, and directlycontrolled much of North India for over hundred years, but, with thismajor exception and few minor ones, all later Hindu imperialism was ofthe quasi-feudal type, loose and unstable. memory of Asoka’srenunciation of further conquest was soon forgotten, and aggressive waragain became sport of kings, and was looked upon by theorists as anormal activity of state. In general history of post-Mauryan India isone of struggle of one [Page 58] dynasty with another for regionaldominance, and political, though not cultural, unity of India was lostfor nearly two thousand years.Pusyamitra is mentioned in several sources, and his name is recorded inone brief inscription, referring to an obscure descendant.7 He did not takeregal titles, but was throughout his reign referred to by simple titlesendpati, or “general”. Agnimitra, his son, who seems to hv been kingduring his father’s lifetime, is known from Kalidasa’s drama Mdlavikd andAgnimitra, while his grandson Vasumitra is recorded in same source ashaving defeated Greeks. An inscription on column at Besnagar (pl. Xc), near Bhilsa, records that Śunga king Bhāgabhadra received anambassador named Heliodorus from Greek king of Taksaśilā, Antialcidas.Otherwise Śungas r mere names, recorded, usually in garbled form,among muddled king-lists of Purānas, religious texts dating fromGupta times onwards.

Meanwhile events were taking place on India’s north-western borders which were to hv profound effect both on her own history and on that of Asia generally. series of invasions, all inadequately documented, brought whole of what is now West Pākistin, Malwa and Kathiāwār, much of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and even for while part of Western Deccan, under control of alien kings.

The first invaders were Bactrian Greeks. Small colonies of Asiatic Greeks had been settled in Bactria by Achaemenids, and these werestrengthened by settlements established by Alexander and Seleucus Nicator.About middle of 3rd century B.C. Diodotus, governor of Bactria,declared himself independent of Seleucid Empire, and Iranianprovince of Parthia became independent at about same time. Diodotuswas succeeded by his son, also named Diodotus, who was soon overthrownand replaced by usurper, Euthydemus. Euthydemus came to terms withthe Seleucid emperor, Antiochus III, who had vainly attempted to regain thelost province; now with his flank secure, he began to expand over HinduKush, and gained foothold on N.-W. Frontier, which had probablyalready broken away from Mauryan Empire. Demetrius, son andsuccessor of Euthydemus, early in 2nd century B.C. pressed further intoIndia. He and his successors occupied most of Indus Valley and thePanjāb, and led great raids far into India, at least one of which, perhaps ledby King Menander, reached Pataliputra. Soon home domains of theBactrian Greeks were wrested from dm by another usurper, Eucratides,but descendants of Euthydemus continued to rule in Panjāb and parts ofthe North-West. Then Eucratids, too, were tempted to try their fortunesbeyond mountains, and gained control of Kabul [Page 59] Valleyand district of Taksagila. Greek domains in India were divided intoseveral petty kingdoms, those of Kabul Valley and N.-W. Frontierchiefly ruled by kings of line of Eucratides, and those of Panjābunder line of Euthydemus.Little is known of history of Greeks in India, and their fortunescan only be faintly reconstructed from their remarkable coins (pl.LXXXIV), most of which bear legends in Greek on obverse and inPrakrit on reverse. From now on, however, ravanas (a termborrowed by India through Persian from Greek) r mentioned fromtime to time in Indian literature. Through Greco-Bactrian kingdomsWestern theories of astrology and medicine began to enter India, andperhaps development of Sanskrit drama was in part inspired fromthis source. More than one Indian tradition speaks of great Yavana raids.One of Greek kings of Panjāb is specially remembered byBuddhism, as patron of philosopher-monk Nagasena; this wasMilinda, or Menander, who ruled at gakāla (?Siālkot), and whose longdiscussions with sage r recorded in well known Pali text, theQuestions of Milinda. Menander is said to hv become Buddhist, but theBesnagar column, to which we hv already referred, shows that Greeksalso sometimes supported orthodox creeds, for it was erected by theambassador Heliodorus in honour of early Vaisnavite deity Vasudeva.Thus some of Greeks, while not completely merging with Indianpopulation, soon felt influence of their ways of thought, and made manycompromises with their culture. author of law-book of Manu,writing probably century or two later than Heliodorus, describes theYavanas as degenerate ksatriyas, or members of warrior class, and thusgives dm place in Hindu society.

The Greco-Bactrian kingdoms, however, did not long survive. Bactria itself was occupied by Parthians early in second half of 2nd century B.C., and Greeks were confined to their possessions in India andAfghanistan. Then fresh invaders appeared from north. complexchain of causes, climatic and political, led to new movements of peoplesof Central Asia. consolidation of Chinese Empire under greatemperor Ch’in Shih Huang Ti (247–210 B.C.), and perhaps also dryingup of their pasture lands, had driven large bands of nomads westwards,from confines of China to region east of Caspian. Soon anomadic people, called by Chinese Yieh-chih, was bearing heavily onthe Scythian tribesmen on borders of Bactria. Scyths, whom Indiawas to know as Sakas, were driven by pressure from north and east to attack Bactria, which they occupied, soon to be followed by [Page 60]Yiieh-chih. Sakas moved on from Bactria to attack first Parthianrulers of Iran, and then Greeks in India. By middle of 1st centuryB.C. only few petty Greek chiefs still ruled in India, and power of thegakas reached as far as Mathurā. gakas continued earlier practice ofissuing coins with inscriptions in Greek and Prakrit. earliest gaka kingknown to hv ruled in India was Maues (? c. 80 B.C.).Towards end of 1st century B.C. line of kings with Iraniannames, usually known as Pahlavas, gained brief suzerainty of N.-W.India. One of them, Gondophernes, is worthy of mention, as ruler towhose kingdom St. Thomas is said to hv brought India’s first knowledgeof Christianity (p. 342). Some authorities hv cast doubt on truth of thelegend, maintaining that Gondophernes’ date was too early for him to havebeen St. Thomas’s contemporary;8 but at any rate he was important enoughfor his fame to reach West, and that St. Thomas preached in India is byno means impossible.The Pahlavas were in turn conquered by Yiieh-chih. racialaffinities of these people r uncertain; physically they were of Turkishtype, but they perhaps spoke an Iranian language, like Sakas. For acentury or more they dwelt in Bactria and neighbouring regions ofCentral Asia, divided into autonomous tribes, until control was consolidatedin hands of Kujula Kadphises, of tribe of Kusanas. At some timein first half of 1st century A.D. Kujila led his warriors over themountains, and he and his son Vima Kadphises between dm gainedcontrol of N.-W. India. Kujula was perhaps responsible for extinction ofthe last of Greek kings, Hermaeus, whose line had held out in Kabulagainst Sakas.Vima Kadphises was succeeded, probably after short interregnum, byKaniska, who controlled all western half of Northern India at least as faras Banaras, and whose dominions in Central Asia were very extensive. TheChinese annals speak of Kusana king, either Kaniska or one of theKadphises, demanding hand of princess of imperial house of Hanin marriage, and being soundly defeated for his arrogance by greatgeneral Pan Ch’ao, who, at end of 1st century A.D., carried Chinesearms as far as Caspian.This period was very important one in history of Buddhism, andKaniska is remembered in Northern Buddhist tradition as great patron ofthe faith. Numerous remains testify to importance and popularity ofBuddhism at time, and it was now that it began to spread to Central Asiaand Far East. Some intimations of Indian religion had alreadyreached China, but it exerted no real influence until now, when Kusanaand Chinese empires were in [Page 61] close contact. period is alsonoteworthy for Gandhāra school of art, which was influential not only inIndia but also, indirectly, in Far East (p. 368f).Professor B.

Bashamb## Caves of AjantaThe date of Kaniska, like chronology of whole gakaKusanaperiod, is very uncertain, and estimates of year of his accession havevaried from 58 B.C. to A.D. 288. At present opinions of most competentauthorities r divided between A.D. 78 and 144. former date is that ofthe foundation of one of most widespread Indian systems of dating, laterknown as gaka Era. Kaniska was not, strictly speaking, gaka, but theterm was very loosely applied, and he is known to hv founded an era.Though date A.D. 78 fits well with other Indian evidence, certaincomplicated synchronisms mainly based on non-Indian sources suggest thathe reigned some decades later than this, and question cannot be finallysettled until new evidence appears. successors of Kaniska continued toreign in N.-W. India, but their empire was soon much reduced. About themiddle of 3rd century Vasudeva, one of Kaniska’s successors, wassoundly defeated by Shapur I, of new Sasanian dynasty of Persia, andfrom now on North-West came much under Iranian influence.Meanwhile new kingdoms had been set up in Peninsula. In Orissa agreat conqueror, Kharavela, appeared about middle of 1st centuryB.C.; he raided far and wide over India and was great patron of Jainism;but his empire was short-lived, and we know nothing of his successors. Atabout same time an important kingdom arose in N.-W. Deccan fromthe ruins of that of Mauryas-the kingdom of Satavahanas orAndhras, centred on Pratisthana (modern Paithan). This survived for 300years or more, until 5rd century A.D., its power often reaching beyondthe Narmada into Malwa and, in 2nd century A.D., from coast to coast.Traditionally first Sātavāhana king, Simuka, put an end to lastinsignificant unfigas and to Kanva kings, who reigned for short timein part of old unfiga Empire. For while, around beginning of the2nd century A.D., Satavahanas were driven from N.-W. Deccan byinvading gakas of clanof Ksaharata, whose great satrap Nahapana left anumber of inscriptions; but Satavahanas, under greatest of theirrulers, Gautamiputra Satakarnin, recovered their landsaboutA.D. 130, andnothing more is heard of Ksaharatas.Another gaka dynasty, generally known as “Western Satraps”, gainedcontrol of Kathiawar and Malwa at about same time, and ruled untilsoon after A.D. 388, at its height governing much of Rajasthan and Sind. Thegreatest ruler of this line [Page 62] was Rudradaman, who has left theearliest important inscription in correct Sanskrit, long panegyric whichrecords his martial exploits and his reconstruction of great artificial lake atGirnar in Kathiawar, which had been excavated under Candragupta andimproved in time of Asoka. This inscription is among earliestcertainly dated records of ancient India, and proves that Rudradaman wasreigning in A.D. 150.At this time Dravidian South first begins to appear in light ofhistory. Traditionally Tamil country has always been divided into threekingdoms-C6la (the Coromandel Coast), Kerala or Cera (Malabar), andPandya (the southern tip of Peninsula). These three r mentioned byAsoka as scenes of his “victories of Righteousness” beyond his owndominions, and few rough inscriptions indicate that Buddhist and Jainaascetics visited Tamil land before beginning of Christian era. Inthe earliest stratum of Tamil literature, which was probably composed in theearly centuries A.D., we find three kingdoms in state of almostcontinual warfare. Their kings, and numerous lesser chieftains who arealso mentioned, seem to hv been more bloodthirsty than those of theNorth, and literature contains hints of massacres and other atrocitiessuch as r rarely heard of in Sanskrit literature; one passage even suggestscannibal feasts after battle. 9 ancient Tamil, by no means perfectlyAryanized, was man of very different stamp from his gentle andthoughtful descendant. Wild and ruthless, delighting in war and drink,worshipping fierce gods with bacchanalian dances, passionate in love, hecompares strikingly with grave and knightly warriors of Sanskritepics, which were probably receiving their final form at time when thepoems of Tamil anthologies were being written. few centuries were toalter picture somewhat, and next stratum of Tamil literature shows amuch deeper penetration of Āryan ideals and standards, but streak ofruthlessness and disregard for individual life is evident in Dravidiancharacter down to fall of Vijayanagara.Very early Tamils took to sea. Even in end century B.C. theytwice invaded Ceylon, first time soon after death of great kingDevanampiya Tissa, and second little later. latter invasion resultedin long occupation of whole of northern half of island by theTamil king Elara, who was expelled with great difficulty by Sinhalesenational hero, King Dutugamunu (in Pali, Dutthagamani) (161–137 B.C.).Tamils probably found their way to S.-E. Asia at about same time, andin 1st century A.D. were in close contact with Egypt and RomanEmpire, through flourishing trade with West (p. 227ff).## GUPTAS AND HARSA[Page 63] We know little of events in North India after decline of theKusanas, but it seems that by 3rd century A.D. all India east of thePanjāb and Malwa was in hands of small Indian kings and tribal chiefs.Some authorities hv tried to depict great Gupta emperors as liberatorsof India from foreign yoke, but it seems that by this time invadershad become thoroughly Indianized, and that their expulsion was work ofthe little known predecessors of Guptas.In A.D. 320 new Candra Gupta,4 arose, whose successors in greatmeasure restored splendour of Mauryas. He owed his rise to powerlargely to his marriage with princess Kumaradevī, of tribe of theLicchavis, who now reappear on scene, eight centuries after their defeatby Ajatasatru. From prominence given to Licchavi princess in thegenealogies of later Gupta kings, and minting of special coins tocommemorate her marriage to Candra Gupta (fig. xxiv a, p. 381), it seemsthat Licchavis had profited by absence of any strong central controlto carve new kingdom, and were very influential in Magadha at time.Candra Gupta I possessed fairly large domains, including regions ofMagadha and Kosala.Under his successor, Samudra Gupta (c. A.D. 335–376), Pataliputra oncemore became centre of great empire. Samudra’s power reached fromAssam to borders of Panjāb. He aimed at establishment of aclosely knit empire of Mauryan type, for in his great Allahabadinscription he is said to hv “violently uprooted” no less than nine kings ofNorthern India, and to hv annexed their kingdoms to his own. martialtribes of Rajasthan, however, merely rendered him homage, as did severalkingdoms on his frontiers, while in Eastern Deccan, where Samudra leda very successful expedition as far as Kāñcī (Conjeeveram), defeatedkings were reinstated on giving homage and tribute, and probably heard nomore of their titular overlord.Samudra Gupta’s main effort was in direction of west, where theSakas had ruled for over 200 years and land was enriched by thelucrative western trade. From their capital of Ujjayini (modern Ujjain) theŚakas still controlled Malwa and Kathiawar, and were power to bereckoned with. Though Samudra’s inscription makes vague reference tohis receiving homage from “the Saka Lords”, it is probable that he did notmeasure swords with them, or, [Page 65] if he did, was unsuccessful, for itis unlikely that he would hv allowed dm to remain independent if hecould hv prevented it. There is indeed story that on his death gakasactually succeeded in shaking Gupta Empire, and forced weak king,Rama Gupta, to conclude dishonourable peace. Most authorities reject thestory, and deny historicity of Rama Gupta, but recent discovery ofcopper coins bearing this name tends to strengthen our belief that it has abasis of fact. 10

[Page 64]

Fig. vii. Gupta Empire
It was Candra Gupta II (c. 376–415), son of Samudra and younger brother of shadowy Rama Gupta, who finally defeated Sakas, soon after A.D. 388. Thus he became paramount sovereign of all NorthernIndia, with exception of NorthWest; and he had some control overmuch of Northern Deccan, thanks to marriage of his daughterPrābhavatī with Rudrasena, king of Vakatakas, who ruled largekingdom in modern Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad. Rudrasena diedyoung, and his widow reigned until her sons came of age. It is evident fromPrābhavatī’s charters that during her regency Vakataka court was muchunder Gupta influence.The reign of Candra Gupta II perhaps marks high watermark ofancient Indian culture. Later Indian legend tells of great and good KingVikramaditya, who drove Sakas out of Ujjayini, and ruled over all India,which in his reign was most prosperous and happy. Vikramaditya wascertainly one of titles of Candra Gupta II, and legend seemstherefore to refer to him. only important discrepancy is that thetraditional Vikramaditya is said to hv founded Vikrama Era, mostimportant of India’s many systems of dating, which is still widely current inNorth India, and which commences in 58 B.C.; thus legend places him some400 years too early. Kalidasa, greatest of India’s poets and dramatists, istraditionally associated with Vikramaditya, and internal evidence of hisworks points to fact that he wrote at about this time.The prosperity and happiness of Candra Gupta’s empire is attested by another foreign traveller, unfortunately not as observant and informative asMegasthenes. This was Fa-hsien, Chinese Buddhist monk who travelledto India in order to obtain authentic copies of scriptures. account ofhis travels gives much information about temples and monasteries, andrepeats many Buddhist legends, but only few passing phrases mentionsocial conditions, and nothing at all is said about Candra Gupta himself,although Fa-hsien was in India for some six years of his reign. pilgrimdid, however, note peacefulness of India, rarity of serious crime, andthe mildness of administration. He stated that it was possible to [Page66] travel from one end of country to other without molestation, andwithout need of passports. In his remarks on social custom he noted thatall respectable people were now vegetarians, meat eating being confined tolow castes and untouchables, in regard to whom he gives us earliestclear reference to “pollution on approach”. He found Buddhism flourishingstill, but theistic Hinduism very widespread.The record of Fa-hsien shows that India had changed much since thedays of Megasthenes, some 700 years earlier. mild ethics of Buddhismand Jainism had gradually leavened Indian society, which was now moregentle and humane than in days of Mauryas. tn place of oldsacrificial Brahmanism, Hinduism had appeared, in form not very greatlydifferent from that of recent centuries. Soon harsher and.more primitiveelements were to re-emerge, but in best days of Gupta Empire Indianculture reached perfection which it was never again to attain. At this timeIndia was perhaps happiest and most civilized region of world, forthe effete Roman Empire was nearing its destruction, and China waspassing through time of troubles between two great periods of theHans and T’angs.

Candra Gupta II was succeeded by his son Kumara Gupta I (c. 415–454),who, like Samudra Gupta, performed Vedic horsesacrifice, which, intheory at least, might only be performed by great conquerors. There is noevidence, however, that he added to his empire, although for most of hisreign he preserved it intact. But in last years of Kumara Gupta I theempire suffered severe blow; as with many other important events of earlyIndian history, details r annoyingly absent, but it is clear that among thechief enemies with whom Guptas had to contend were new invaders,called in India Hūnas. They were Central Asian people, known toByzantine writers as Hephthalites or White Huns, and it is usuallyconsidered that they were branch of great group of TurkoMongolpeoples who were threatening Europe at about same time; certainmodern scholars, however, claim that they were in no way related to theHuns of Attila, but were of Iranian stock.11 Hūnas had occupied Bactriasome time before, and now, like earlier Greeks, gakas and Kusanas, theycrossed mountains and attacked plains of India; it is probable thatkindred Central Asian tribes came in their train.Once more Western India was prey of fierce raiders, who were withthe greatest difficulty kept at bay by Emperor’s son, Skanda Gupta.During war with Hūnas Kumara Gupta died, and Skanda Gupta (c.455–467) assumed power, though not born of [Page 67] chief queen andtherefore not regular heir to throne. He succeeded in re-establishingthe Gupta Empire, and by end of 455 it was again at peace; but hereigned for little more than twelve years, and on his death great days ofthe Guptas were over. empire continued, but central control weakened,and local governors became feudatory kings with hereditary rights. BeyondMagadha and Bengal Gupta emperors now exercised little more thantitular control.At close of 5th century fresh Hūna inroads occurred, and this timewere even more difficult to repel. empire was disunited, and no strongman of calibre of Skanda Gupta came forward to drive out invader.For some thirty years, from A.D. 500 onwards, Western India was in thehands of Huna kings, two of whom, Toramana and his son Mihirakula, wereapparently mighty monarchs. latter is remembered by 7th centuryChinese traveller Hsiian Tsang as fierce persecutor of Buddhism, and inKashmir, one of centres of his power, memories of his sadistic tyrannywere still alive in 12th century, when they were recorded by thehistorian Kalhana. Mihirakula seems to hv been driven from plain ofthe Ganges by Narasimha Gupta, who had cognomen Baladitya, underwhich his triumph is recorded by Hsüan Tsang; about 530 Mihirakula wasalso defeated in Western India, this time by Yasodharman, an energetic kingof Mandasor, who built large kingdom which did not survive his death.Though Mihirakula apparently retained his hold on Kashmīr and parts ofthe North-West, Hūna power never again seriously threatened India, and theHūnas soon lost their individuality.

These incursions were death-blow of Gupta Empire, which by A.D.550 had completely vanished. new Gupta line, probably not related to thegreat one, ruled in Magadha until 8th century. North of Gangesanother kingdom, that of Maukharis, rose to prominence, and first gaveimportance to city of Kanyakubja, modern Kanauj, which was tobecome cultural centre of Northern India until coming of theMuslims, and its largest and most prosperous city. In Gujarat line ofGupta feudatories, Maitrakas, became strong and independent.Evidently all semblance of political unity had again vanished. It is at thistime that we first hear of Gurjaras, new people who were to provideone of strongest dynasties of Middle Ages. invasions of theHūnas destroyed or dispersed older martial tribes of Rajasthan, and theirplaces were taken by newcomers, probably acclimatized invaders, fromwhom most of Rajput clans of Middle Ages were descended.[Page 68] centre of interest now shifts for time to Sthanvlsvara(modern Thanesar), in watershed of Satlaj and Jamna, which isso important for India’s security, and where so many decisive battles havebeen fought. Here local king, Prabhakaravardhana of family ofPusyabhuiti, had grown in power as result of successful raids on WesternIndia and against Hūnas, who still held parts of Panjāb. His motherwas princess of second Gupta line, and his daughter, Rajyasri, wasmarried to Maukhari king, Grahavarman. Thus Prabhakaravardhanakept on good terms with his neighbours in east, while he gatheredstrength in west. But Guptas and Maukharis were hereditaryenemies, and, at about time of Prabhakaravardhana’s death, war brokeout between them. Rajyavardhana, new king of Sthanvilvara, hurried tothe support of Maukharis, while Guptas had assistance ofSasiaka, king of Bengal. In war both Grahavarman of Kanyakubjaand Rajyavardhana of Sthanvlsvara were killed. former died without anheir, and two kingdoms were combined under Harsavardhana or Harsa,the second son of Prabhakaravardhana and brother-in-law ofGrahavarman.Harsa ascended throne in 606 at age of sixteen, and in forty-one years of his reign he succeeded in partially restoring glories of theGuptas. Some of his fame is due to fact that, in comparison with mostother early Indian kings, his reign is remarkably well documented. poetBāna, who was patronized by Harsa, has left florid account of eventsleading up to his rise to power (p. 446ff), while in latter part of his reignIndia was visited by another Chinese pilgrim, Hsiian Tsang, who wrote avery valuable description of India, which, unlike account ofMegasthenes, has survived intact. While his main purpose, like that of Fa-hsien, was to obtain Buddhist manuscripts and visit sacred sites, HsüanTsang was less other-worldly than earlier pilgrim, and he was in closetouch with Harsa, whom he much admired and who gave him an honouredplace at his court. His work is therefore of much greater historical valuethan that of Fa-hsien.

Although Harsa gained control of most of Northern India, fromKāthiāwār to Bengal, his empire was feudal in structure. Outside theimmediate domains of Kānyakubjaand Sthanvisvara, many of old kingsretained their thrones. Śaśnka, fierce anti-Buddhist king of Bengal, whooverran Magadha at time of Harsa’s accession, was driven back to hisown domains and his kingdom fell to Harsa, but Deva Gupta, king whohad been chiefly responsible for downfall of Harsa’s brother-in-lawGrahavarman Maukhari, was replacedbyarelative,Madhava Gupta, andthe Maitraka king of [Page 69] Kathiawar, after being defeated by Harsa,was allowed to retain his throne as vassal. Harsa controlled his greatempire by ceaselessly travelling from province to province, both in his owndomains and in those of his feudatories, who seem to hv spent much timein attendance on their overlord. When he died without heirs it is notsurprising that his empire fell to pieces.

Harsa seems to hv been man of great gifts and intense energy. As Candragupta by Megasthenes, he is described by Hsüan Tsang as hearingthe complaints of his humbler subjects with unwearying patience, not in hisaudience hall, but in small travelling pavilion by roadside. He lovedpomp, however, and in his progresses he was accompanied by tremendoustrain of attendants, courtiers, officials, Buddhist monks, and brahmans. Hewas loyal and warm friend, and, if we cn believe sources,fantastically generous to those whom he favoured. He loved philosophy andliterature, and in his leisure found time to write three very competentdramas (p. 441).

His empire was very extensive. Even Bhaskaravarman, king ofremote Assam, attended his court, and if not technically feudatory to himwas much under his influence. It would seem that Bhaskaravarman assistedHarsa against Sas’ika at beginning of his reign, and two kings werelifelong friends. Only in Deccan Harsa could make no progress. Here heattacked Calukya king Pulakegin II, but was thoroughly defeated, andcould never again pass Narmada.

Hsian Tsang shows that Buddhism was definitely declining in India at this time, although in latter part of his reign Harsa fell increasinglyunder its influence. Now certain elements of later Hinduism, of which thereare few traces in time of Guptas, were strongly in evidence. Thegrowth of tantric cults (p. 337) and of such practices as sati (p. 187f) showsthat cultural decline had already set in. Law and order were not as wellmaintained as in Gupta times, for, in contrast to Fa-hsien, who was soimpressed by peaceable and law-abiding state of India, Hsiian Tsangwas twice robbed by bandits in Harsa’s domains, and on one occasion wasnearly sacrificed to goddess Durga by river pirates, in very heart ofthe empire.

## MIDDLE AGES IN NORTH
The history of succeeding centuries is rather drab story of endemicwarfare between rival dynasties. It cn be followed in some detail, thanks tothe numerous inscriptions and copper-plate charters [Page 70] of period,but detail is monotonous and uninteresting to all but specialist.On Harsa’s death there was great confusion. usurper, Arunāśva,temporarily seized Kānyakubja, and attacked Wang Hsüan-ts’ê, who hadcome with small detachment of troops as ambassador to Harsa from theChinese emperor, T’ai-tsung. Wang escaped with his little force andgathered reinforcements from Tibet, Nepal and Assam; with aid of thesehe captured Arunāśva, who was taken back to China to end his days inattendance on T’ang Emperor. After this Bhāskaravarman of Assamextended his power westwards, and occupied part of Magadha. Meanwhilethe second Gupta dynasty revived, and Adityasena Gupta was mostimportant monarch of latter half of 7th century, and one of lastgreat Indian kings to perform Vedic horse-sacrifice. Early in 8thcentury an upstart named Yasovarman established an empire at Kanyakubja,which for while controlled much of North, but which soon fell toLalitaditya, one of few Kashmīr kings to play an important part in thepolitics of Gangetic Plain. In following two centuries two greatdynasties, Palas of Bihār and Bengal, and Gurjara-Pratiharas ofKanyakubja, divided hegemony of Northern India between them.The Palas of Eastern India were first to gain ascendancy, and for awhile, in early part of 9th century, were masters of Kānyakubja.The long reign of great king Dharmapala (c. 770–810) marks apogeeof Pala power; by time of his death control of Kānyakubjawas lost, buthis successor, Devapala (c. 810–850), was still very important king, whowas in diplomatic contact with Śailendra kings of Sumītra. Palakings r chiefly notable for their patronage of Buddhism, which, in rathercorrupt form, flourished in their dominions during three centuries oftheir rule. It was from Pala empire that Buddhism was introduced intoTibet, where, combined with many native beliefs, it survives to presentday.In 9th and 10th centuries Gurjara-Pratiharas, who probablyoriginated in Rajasthan, were masters of Kanyakubja, and mostpowerful kings of Northern India. They successfully resisted Arabs,who, in 712, had occupied Sind, and who for over century made frequentattacks on their eastern neighbours. two most powerful Pratihara kings,Mihira Bhoja (c. 840–885) and Mahendrapala (c. 885–910), pushed backthe Palas, and were overlords of most of Northern India as far as bordersof Bengal. But they were weakened by repeated invasions of theRāstrakūtas of Deccan, who, in 916, temporarily occupied Kānyakubja.

These [Page 72] persistent raids from south seem to hv turned attention of Pratihara kings away from North-West, where new forces were gathering which were ultimately to overthrow Hindu India.

Though Pratihāras regained their capital after its occupation by Rastrakutas, they never regained their strength, and throughout loth century Pratihara feudatories grew more and more powerful at expense of their former masters.

In Afghanistan line of Turkish chieftains had established powerfulkingdom at Ghazni, and began to look covetously at rich plains of India.In 986 one of their amirs, Sabuktigin, made his first raid on mostimportant king of N.-W. India, Jayapala; in second raid he occupiedPeshawar. In 997 he was succeeded by his son Mahmūd, who soonembarked on deliberate policy of raiding rich and divided kingdoms ofIndia. In 1001 he defeated and captured Jayapala, who committed suicide.Jayapala’s son, Anandapala, formed league of Hindu princes against theinvader, but unwieldy and disunited Indian forces, basing their strategyand tactics on ancient precepts and relying on unpredictable morale ofthe fighting elephant, were defeated near Peshāwar by smaller and moremobile Muslim army, and whole of India lay open to invader.Between 1001 and 1027 Mahmid made seventeen great raids on India. Thewhole western half of land felt force of Turuskas; palaces andtemples were looted and desecrated, and enormous caravans of booty andslaves were taken back to Ghazni. raids reached as far as greatshrine of Somnath in Kathiawar, and kingdom of Candellas inBundelkhand. Among India’s great cities Kānyakubjaand Mathurā werecaptured and plundered.Mahmud did not remain in India, however, for, though Muslimchroniclers depict him as staunch propagator of Islam, intent onconverting infidel and bringing India under control of true faith,his expeditions were rather for purpose of plunder than of conquest. Butthe N.-W. Frontier and Panjāb were annexed to his kingdom, as were theArab kingdoms of Sind, which had long ceased to be menace to rest ofIndia. After sack of Kānyakubjathe great Pratihara dynasty, which hadbeen losing power for hundred years, soon disappeared. Its last importantking, Rajyapala, was defeated and dethroned by his neighbour Vidyadharathe Candella, whose kingdom had formerly been tributary to Pratiharas,and who profited by their discomfiture at hands of Muslim to extendhis own power; but Vidyadhara himself was too weak to resist Mahmūdeffectively, and was forced to pay him tribute.For about century and half Northern India retained its independence.In Banāras and Kānyakubjaa new ruling family, Gāhada [Page 73]valas, managed to build fairly prosperous kingdom. In Rajasthan thedynasty of Cahamanas rose in prominence and power. influence ofthe Candellas of Bundelkhand grew with fall of Pratiharas. InGujarat there ruled prosperous line of Caulukyas or Solankīs, muchunder influence of Jainism. In Mālwā Paramara dynasty flourishedunder King Bhoja (1018–1055), famous in legend, who was anaccomplished scholar and great builder of dams and artificial lakes forirrigation (p. 192f). Madhya Pradesh was in hands of Kalacuridynasty. In Bengal Palas were replaced by Senas, who were strongsupporters of orthodox Hinduism, and who inaugurated something of anantiBuddhist reaction.

As well as main dynasties, whose names we havementioned, there were many lesser lines, theoretically tributary to thegreater, but virtually independent in their own territories and always readyto revolt against their overlords. conservative kings of India had learntno lessons from Mahmiid’s raids. They were still incapable of serious co-operation, and their enormous armies were slow and unwieldy. At endof 12th century three chief kings of Northern India-PrthvīrājaCāhamāna, Jayaccandra Gahadavala, and Paramardideva Candella5 —werein state of tripartite war.A new Turkish ruling house supplanted line of Mahmūd inAfghanistan. In 1173 Ghiyas-ud-din of Ghor annexed Ghazni. His youngerbrother, Shihab-ud-din, usually known as Muhammad of Ghor, proceededto conquer Ghaznavid possessions in Panjāb and Sind, and thenturned his attention to Hindu states. initiative in resistance camefrom Prthviraja, who patched up his quarrels and prepared to meet theinvader. In 1191 Hindu army met Muhammad at Tarain, not far fromThanesar, once capital of great Harsa. invaders were defeated,but in following year they returned with larger force. This time themounted archers of Muslims overpowered Hindu army andPrthviraja was defeated and killed. He is remembered to this day by theRajputs as model of chivalry and courage, and is hero of many folkballads.Muhammad returned home, and left work of conquest to his generals.The chief of these, Qutb-ud-din Aibak, occupied Delhi, an important city ofthe Cahamana kingdom, and made it his headquarters. Another general,Muhammad ibn Bakhtiyar, pressed on down [Page 74] Ganges andoverran Bihār, where he put many Buddhist monks to sword. He thenoccupied Bengal with little difficulty. Candella kingdom ofBundelkhand fell in 1203. In 1206 Muhammad, who had succeeded hisbrother as sultan of Ghor, was assassinated, and his general Qutb-ud-din, amanumitted slave, became first sultan of Delhī.In Rajasthan and other outlying districts Hindu kingdoms continued,sometimes paying tribute to more energetic sultans, but often virtuallyfree, while regions with sharply defined natural boundaries, such asKashmir, Nepal, Assam and Orissā, retained their autonomy. Thesekingdoms had always been in effect independent, only occasionallyrendering tribute and homage to greater kings of Plains, and ingeneral they had little political effect on India as whole, and were littleaffected by it politically. From now on, until 18th century, Muslimrulers dominated Northern India, and great days of Hindu civilizationwere at an end.


## MIDDLE AGES IN PENINSULA
While in Northern India standards of Hindu culture declined somewhat after Gupta age, in Deccan they flourished and advanced.  By this time Āryan influence had penetrated whole of Peninsula, and contact of Āryan and Dravidian produced vigorous cultural synthesis, which in turn had an immense influence on Indian civilization as whole.

Power was generally centred on two foci, one in Western Deccan and other in Cōla country, Coromandel coast. political history ofthe medieval Deccan is largely concerned with struggles between thedynasties controlling these two centres. Many lsser kingdoms also existed,however, often tributary to larger ones, but sometimes rising toconsiderable power.In Northern Deccan Vakatakas vanished at about same time asthe Guptas, and in middle of 6th century west and centre of thePeninsula came under control of Calukya Dynasty, ruling fromVātāpi (now called Badami) in Hyderabad. Its greatest king, Pulakegin II(c. 609–642), was approximate contemporary of Harsa, whom hesuccessfully resisted, only to be defeated at end of his reign byNarasimhavarman, Pallava king of Kāñcī (Conjeeveram). Pallavas,who had been ruling since 4th century, were great temple builders (p.355), and seem to hv much encouraged growth of Āryan institutionsin South.In 7th century Calukyas divided into eastern and western [Page75] branches, and in following century western branch was replacedby Rastrakutas of Manyakheta (modern Malkhed, in Hyderabad), whosemartial efforts were largely directed against North, and who made manyraids beyond Narmada. revived Calukya line, ruling from Kalyani,replaced Rastrakutas in 973, and controlled Deccan until end ofthe 12th century, when their empire was divided between Yadavas ofDevagiri in Northern Deccan, Kākatīyas of Warangal in Telugu-speaking areas of east, and Hoysalas of Dōrasamudra in Mysore.The Pallavas of Kanci persisted with declining fortunes until end ofthe 9th century, when their territories were annexed by Cola kings ofTanjore, Aditya I (c. 870–906), and Parāntaka. I (c. 906–953). Cōlakingdom, one of three great kingdoms of Tamil tradition, had beenvirtually submerged by Pallavas for centuries. Now it rose again, and forsome 300 years ruled Coromandel Coast and much of EasternDeccan, giving large measure of security to its people and supporting aflourishing social and cultural life. most notable of Cōla kings wereRajaraja I (985–1014) and Rajendra I (1014–1042), in whose reigns thepower of dynasty reached its zenith. former conquered Ceylon, andthe latter carried his power by land to mouth of Ganges, and sent outa great naval expedition, which occupied parts of Burma, Malaya andSumatra. This was perhaps despatched with intention of suppressing thepiratical activities of Indonesian kings, who interfered with theflourishing trade between South India and China. Cōla hold on S.-E.Asia does not appear to hv lasted long, however, and Rajendra’s navalexpedition is unique in annals of India.The Cōlas held Northern Ceylon until soon after 1070, when they wereexpelled by Sinhalese king Vijayabahu I (1070–1114). From now on theCōla power declined, and Pāndya kings of Madurai were continuallyattempting to regain their independence, while pressure from Calukyasincreased. Vijayabahu of Ceylon inaugurated period of success andprosperity for island, which culminated in reign of Parakramabahu I(1153–1186), greatest of Sinhalese kings (pl. LX a), whose splendourcan be seen in remains of his capital, Polonnaruva, whither seat ofgovernment had been transferred from earlier capital of Anuradhapuraat time of Tamil invasions. Parakramabahu for while turned thetables on Tamils, and Sinhalese troops, profiting by Pandyanrebellions against Cōlas, attacked Indian coast, and even temporarilyoccupied Madurai.

Though their power declined, Cōlas long maintained central [Page76] part of their empire, region around Kāñcī and Tanjore. politicalstability and freedom from attack afforded by their efficient governmentgreatly encouraged Tamil culture, and large number of donativeinscriptions of this period testifies to flourishing economy.Administratively Cōla Empire is remarkable for influence exertedby local autonomous bodies; village and district councils, under thesupervision of central government, introduced an element into thestructure of state which, if not democratic, was at least popular (p. 106).The Cōlas fell in 13th century when their territory was shared by theHoysalas of Mysore and revived Pandya dynasty of Madurai. Now theDeccan was soon to feel force of Islam, which was already master ofNorthern India. In reign of theablesultanofDelhi,Ala’-ud-din Khalji(1296–1315), series of brilliant raids, led by eunuch general MalikKafur, converted Hindu, crushed Deccan kingdoms, and for time aMuslim sultanatewasset up even in Madurai, in extreme south.The Dravidians were not finally subjugated, however. Within few yearsof Malik Kafur’s raids, in 1336, an independent Hindu kingdom wasfounded at Vijayanagara, on Tufigabhadra River. This kingdom, afterdesperately resisting Bahmani sultans of Northern Deccan,established its hegemony over whole Peninsula from Krsna Riversouthwards. Learning something of military strategy from their Muslimenemies, kings of Vijayanagara maintained their independence until themiddle of 16th century, and, in reduced form, even later. Of thesplendour and affluence of their capital we hv European accounts, fromthe Italian Nicolo dei Conti, who visited India in early 15th century andfrom Portuguese travellers Paes and Nuniz, who made contact with thekingdom of Vijayanagara about hundred years later from recentlyestablished Portuguese settlement of Goa. All were impressed by thesplendour of capital and wealth of court. great king KrsnaDeva Raya (1509–1529) (pl. LXXI), had he lived longer, might hv driventhe Muslims from Deccan altogether. Of him Paes wrote in terms rarelyused by European traveller of an oriental monarch:“He is most feared and perfect king that could possibly be, cheerfulof disposition and very merry; he is one that seeks to honour foreigners, …asking about all their affairs whatever their condition may be. He is greatruler and man of much justice, but subject to sudden fits of rage.… He isby rank greater lord than any, by reason of what he possesses in armiesand territories, but … he has nothing compared to what man like himought to have, so gallant and perfect is he in all things.” 12[Page 77] Paes, in reign of Krsna Deva Raya, remarked on theprosperity of people and cheapness of provisions; but Nuniz, thesecond Portuguese traveller, who visited Vijayanagara in reign ofKrsna’s successor Acyuta (1529–42), was less impressed, and stated thatthe underlings of king were overbearing and common people muchoppressed. It is evident that beneficient regime of Krsna Deva Raya wasnot continued after his death. His successors were weaker men than he, andembroiled themselves unnecessarily in intrigues of Muslimsultanates of Northern Deccan, relying on prestige gained for themby their more powerful predecessor. In 1565, at Talikota, de facto rulerof Vijayanagara, Rama Raja, was utterly defeated by coalition of Deccansultans, great city was mercilessly sacked, and greatness of theempire was at an end.This was last important Hindu kingdom of older type. That of theMarathas, which arose in Western Deccan in late 17th century andwas most forceful element in Indian politics in 18th, lies beyond ourprovince.

The ultimate importance of this period in history of Peninsula was
cultural and religious. Jainism was once very strong in Mysore and other
parts of South, and often, under royal patronage, it became virtually the
state religion. But in Tamil country at this period new ecstatically
devotional theism arose, looking for inspiration rather to hymns in the
vernacular than to Vedas or earlier sacred texts in Sanskrit. This was
subsequently to set standard for popular religion of whole of
India, through work of missionary theologians who travelled all over the
sub-continent in later middle ages. work and influence of great
medieval Dravidian saints and philosophers will be discussed in another
chapter.

This brief outline of political history of Hindu India shows that sheproduced many bold adventurers and imperious conquerors. As ourfollowing chapter tells, they were ruthless in gaining and retaining power,and looked on war as normal political expedient. Except during theMauryan period political unity was unknown, and highly organized andtightly controlled administration of ancient Indian state had nocounterpart in inter-state relations, where endemic anarchy was onlymitigated by tradition of fair play in warfare, which was by no meansalways followed. Here, and in conservatism of medieval period, laythe great weakness of Hindu India, which made her prey to successiveinvaders. Of these wild tribes of Central Asia were rapidly assimilated,but Muslims with their rigidly codified religion, were too much for eventhe omnivorous Hindu culture to digest. Interaction between two [Page78] religions and ways of life indeed took place, and once at least modusvivendi was almost reached (p. 480). It is not wholly surprising, however,that, when India began to reassert herself, two nations should hv replacedthe single British Raj; but all impartial students must regret that unity ofthe Indian sub-continent has been once more lost, and trust that twogreat nations of India and Pakistan may soon forget bitterness born ofcenturies of strife, in cooperation for common welfare of their peoples.

THE STATE: POLITICAL LIFE AND
THOUGHT


SOURCES
[Page 79]
FROM days of Plato and Aristotle European thought has turned its attention to such questions as origin of state, ideal form ofgovernment, and basis of law, and politics has long been looked on as abranch of philosophy. India also thought on such questions, but she had noschools of political philosophy in Western sense. problems whichform stock-in-trade of European political philosopher r answeredin Indian texts, but in take-it-or-leave-it manner, with little discussion;often indeed only argument in favour of proposition is citation ofan old legend, used much as Plato’s adaptations of older myths to reinforcehis theories.

Though India had no formal political philosophy, science of statecraft was much cultivated, and number of important textbooks on this topic hv survived. Dandanīti, administration of force, or rājanīti, conduct of kings, was severely practical science, and texts cursorilydismiss more philosophical aspect of politics, but give comparativelydetailed advice on organization of state and conduct ofgovernmental affairs. later Vedic literature tells us something,incidentally, about political life and thought in pre-Buddhist period, andwe cn gather much from Pāli scriptures of Buddhism; but earliestand most important textbook specifically devoted to statecraft is theKautilīya Arthaśāstra, which is attributed to Kautilya, famous ministerof Candragupta Maurya (p. 50). Some authorities still maintain fullauthenticity of work, but there r grave objections to this view. Thetext refers to people and places (notably China) which do not seem to havebeen known to Indians in 4th century B.C. It does not use much ofthe official terminology employed in Aśokan inscriptions or in Pāliscriptures, but it contains many governmental terms which apparently didnot become popular until post-Mauryan times. Yet it is certainly pre-Guptan, and is, we believe, elaboration of Mauryan original whichwas perhaps work of Kautilya himself. Whatever its age, Arthaśāstragives very detailed instructions on control of state, organizationof national economy, and conduct [Page 80] of war, and it is mostprecious source-book for many aspects of ancient Indian life.

The next important source, in chronological order, is great epic, Mahābhārata, of which twelfth book, known as Santi Parvan, is acollection of many disparate passages on statecraft and human conduct,inserted into body of epic in early centuries of Christian era.Other passages on statecraft r found elsewhere in Mahābhārata, and inthe second of great epics, Rāmāyna. great body of literaturegenerally called Smrti, giving instruction in Sacred Law, is veryimportant in this connexion, and will be discussed later (p. 128f); especiallysignificant is seventh section of lawbook ascribed to primevalsage Manu, probably composed early in Christian era.

From Gupta period and Middle Ages number of political texts survive, most important of which r Nītisāra (“Essence of Politics”) of Kāmandaka, perhaps written during Gupta period, Nītivākyāmrta(“Nectar of Aphorisms on Politics”) of Somadeva Sūri, Jaina writer of the10th century, and Nītiśātra (“Treatise on Politics”) attributed to theancient sage Śukra, but evidently of late medieval origin. These repeatmuch that has been said before, but here and there contain original ideas.Besides sources specifically dealing with political life and thought, ancientIndian literature as whole, from Rg Veda onwards, yields muchinformation, and inscriptions of one kind and another r extremelyvaluable in this connexion.

The texts do not discuss wholly impossible utopias; their advice is often pedantic, but usually more or less feasible. However, it is not likely that anyking conducted his affairs wholly on textbook lines, and there is ampleevidence that recommendations of experts were not always put intoeffect. reader must always bear in mind that in texts on statecraftand Sacred Law authors describe things not as they were in fact, but asthey believed they ought to be. Probably in no kingdom of ancient India,not even in that of Mauryas, was influence of state quite so all-pervading as in system envisaged by Arthaśāstra, though its authorevidently based his precept upon current practice. Similarly viciouspunishments laid down by Manu for religious crimes (for example śūdrawho “arrogantly teaches brāhmans their duty” shall hv boiling oil pouredin his mouth and ears1) r suggestions of fanatic and were rarely ifever put into practice. Moreover texts r permeated with pedantry, andshow passion for sterile classification to which Indian pandit hasoften been prone. It is unlikely that more energetic and self-reliant rulersworried [Page 81] overmuch about Arthaśātra’s discussion of differentschools of thought on such questions as whether it is better to acquire wildand rebellious but prosperous country, or pacific but poor one. Manyerrors hv been made by historians through their uncritical acceptance ofthese political texts as giving an exact picture of things as they were.

## KINGSHIP
The earliest legend on origin of kingship occurs in Aitareya Brāhmana, 2 one of later Vedic texts, perhaps of 8th or 7th century B.C. This tells how gods and demons were at war, and gods were suffering badly at hands of their enemies. So they met together and decided that they needed rājā to lead dm in battle. They appointed Indra as their king, and tide soon turned in their favour. This legend suggests that in earliest times kingship in India was thought to be based uponhuman need and military necessity, and that king’s first duty was to leadhis subjects in war. little later Taittirīya Upanisad3 repeats story,but in significantly altered form; discomfited gods did not elect Indra,but sacrificed to high god Prajāpati, who sent his son Indra to becometheir king. At this stage king was still thought of as primarily leader inwar-“they who hv no king cannot fight” says text-but kingship wasalready given divine sanction and king of immortals, who was theprototype of all earthly kings, held his office by appointment of theMost High.

Even at this time, before days of Buddha, king was exalted far above ordinary mortals, through magical power of great royal sacrifices. Royal Consecration (rājasūya), which in its full form comprised series of sacrifices lasting for over year, imbued king with divine power. In course of ceremonies he was identified with Indra “because he is ksatriya and because he is sacrificer”, 4 and even with high god Prajāpati himself.5 He took three steps on tiger’s skin, and was thus magically identified with god Visnu, whose three paces covered earth and heaven. chief priest addressed gods with words: “Of mighty power is he who has been consecrated; now he has become one of yours; you must protect him.”6 king was evidently fellow of gods, if not god himself.

The magical power which pervaded king at his consecration wasrestored and strengthened in course of his reign by further rites, such asthe ceremonial rejuvenation of vājapeya and horse-sacrifice( aśvamedha, p. 42), which not only ministered to his [Page 82] ambitionand arrogance, but also ensured prosperity and fertility of kingdom.Implicit in whole brāhmanic ritual was idea of king’s divineappointment, and though rājasūfya was replaced in later times by asimplified abhiseka, or baptism, ceremony still had this magical flavour.

But centre of brāhmanic culture was Ganges-Jamnā Doāb. Ifamong Kurus and Pañcālas, who were chief tribes of this region, theking was hedged about with divine mystery, elsewhere his status may havebeen less exalted, for Buddhists had their own legend of origin ofkingship, which involved no heavenly prototype, but looked back to aprimitive social contract.7 story is put into mouth of Buddhahimself, and, whether or not it is really his, it certainly represents thethought on subject in eastern part of India in centuries followingthe Buddha’s death, for Jainas, who rose at about same time and inthe same region, had very similar legend.8In early days of cosmic cycle mankind lived on an immaterialplane, dancing on air in sort of fairyland, where there was no need of foodor clothing, and no private property, family, government or laws. Thengradually process of cosmic decay began its work, and mankind becameearthbound, and felt need of food and shelter. As men lost their primevalglory distinctions of class ( varna) arose, and they entered into agreementsone with another, accepting institutions of private property and thefamily. With this theft, murder, adultery, and other crime began, and so thepeople met together and decided to appoint one man among dm tomaintain order in return for share of produce of their fields and herds.

He was called “the Great Chosen One” ( Mahāsammata), and he received title of rājā because he pleased people. etymology of word rājā from verb rañayati (“he pleases”) is certainly false one, but it was widely maintained and is found even in non-Buddhist sources. story of Mahāsammata gives, in form of myth worthy ofPlato, one of world’s earliest versions of widespread contractualtheory of state, which in Europe is specially connected with namesof Locke and Rousseau. It implies that main purpose of government isto establish order, and that king, as head of government, is firstsocial servant, and ultimately dependent on suffrage of his subjects.Thus in ancient Indian thought on question of origin of monarchytwo strands r evident, mystical and contractual, often ratherincongruously combined.

In thought, if not in practice, it was mystical theory of kingship [Page83] which carried most weight with succeeding generations. author ofthe Arthaśāstra had no illusions about king’s human nature, and seemsto hv had little time for mysticism, but he recognized that legends aboutthe origin of kingship had propaganda value. In one place he advises thatthe king’s agents should spread story that, when anarchy prevailed at thedawn of aeon, men elected mythical first king Manu Vaivasvata tokingship. 9 He thus encourages contractual theory. In same passage,however, he states that people should be told that, as king fulfils thefunctions of gods Indra (the king of gods) and Yama (the god ofdeath) upon earth, all who slight him will be punished not only by thesecular arm, but also by heaven. When king harangues his troops beforebattle he is advised to tell dm that he is paid servant just as they are; 10but at same time he is told to go to length of having his secret agentsdisguised as gods, and allowing himself to be seen in their company, inorder that his simpler subjects may believe that he mixes with gods onequal terms.11 Aśoka and other Mauryan kings took title “Beloved ofthe Gods” ( Devānampiya), and, though they seem not to hv claimedwholly divine status, they were no doubt looked on as superior semi-divinebeings.

In period of later Vedas, though there is no evidence that reallylarge Indian kingdom had existed since days of then forgottenHarappā Culture, possibility of realm reaching to sea wasrecognized, perhaps as result of what Indians had heard of Babylonia orPersia. With Mauryas possibility was realized, and though they toowere soon largely forgotten, they left behind dm tradition of theUniversal Emperor ( cakravartin), which was incorporated into Buddhisttradition, and, blended with later Vedic imperialist ideas, was taken over byorthodox Hinduism. Just as Buddhas appear from time to time in cosmiccycle, heralded by auspicious omens and endowed with favourable signs, tolead all living beings along road to enlightenment, so do UniversalEmperors appear, to conquer all Jambūdvīpa and rule prosperously andrighteously. concept of Universal Emperor was also known to theJainas, and in Epics numerous kings of legend, such as Yudhisthira andRāma, r said to hv been digvijayins, conquerors of all four quarters.

The Universal Emperor was divinely ordained figure with special place in cosmic scheme, and as such was exalted to semi-divine status. tradition was an inspiration to ambitious monarchs, and in Middle Ages some even claimed to be Universal Emperors themselves. invasions of Greeks, Śakas and Kusānas brought new influencesfrom West and East. Their kings, following practice [Page 84] of theorientalized Seleucids and other rulers of Middle East, took semi-divine title trātāra, equivalent to Greek(saviour); they were notsatisfied with simple title of rājā, which had served Aśoka, but were“great kings” ( mahārāja) and “kings of kings” ( rājaāirāja) on Persianmodel. Kusānas, perhaps from influence of China, where theemperor was Son of Heaven, took further title “Son of Gods”( devaputra). Later, from Gupta times onwards, every important king wouldtake some such title as “Great King of Kings, Supreme Lord”( mahārājādhirāja-paramabhaāraka), while even title mahārāja wasused only for small vassal kings.

prince. At his feet imperial elephant and horse.

With these influences at work doctrine of royal divinity was explicitly
proclaimed. It appears first in Epics and Lawbook of Manu. The
latter declares in dignified language:
“When world was without king and dispersed in fear in all
directions, Lord created king for protection of all. [Page 85]
“He made him of eternal particles Of Indra and Wind, Yama, the
Sun and Fire, Varuna, Moon, and Lord of Wealth.

“And, because he has been formed of fragments of all those gods,
the king surpasses all other beings in splendour.

“Even an infant king must not be despised, as though mere mortal,
for he is great god in human form.” 12
To ideal of Universal Emperor was added inspiration of the
revival of such brāhmanic ceremonies as horse-sacrifice, which
apparently fell into desuetude under Mauryas, but was revived by the
Śungas, and was performed by many later kings both in north and south.

Even comparatively feeble and petty monarchs managed to perform horse-sacrifices of some sort, and claimed exalted status of emperors oflegend. After time of Guptas these sacrifices became rare, however-the last we hv been able to trace took place in Cōa Empire in 11thcentury13—but tradition of royal divinity continued. Kings referred totheir divine status in their titles and panegyrics, and they were regularlyaddressed by their courtiers as deva, or god. Cōla kings and someothers were even worshipped as gods in temples.

In period between Mauryas and Guptas anarchy frequentlyprevailed. Mass lawlessness, riot, pillage and rape, were widespread.Raiding bands of invaders from North-West penetrated far into heartof India, and some brāhmans even believed that end of aeon wasdrawing near and that world would soon be destroyed. It was then thatan almost pathological dread of anarchy ( mātsyanyāya, literally “the way ofthe fishes”, of whom stronger eat weaker) grew in minds ofIndian thinkers. In words of Rāmāyana:“Where land is kingless cloud, lightning-wreathed and loud-voiced, gives no rain to earth.

“Where land is kingless son does not honour his father, nor wife her husband.

“Where land is kingless men do not meet in assemblies, nor make lovely gardens and temples.

[Page 86] “Where land is kingless rich r unprotected, and shepherds and peasants sleep with bolted doors.

“A river without water, forest without grass, herd of cattle without herdsman, is land without king.” 14
Passages such as this, which may be paralleled in many sources, further
assisted in strengthening royal prestige, and it is in their light that we
must read later legends on origin of kingship.

There is very ancient story of first man, Manu, who combined thecharacteristics of Adam and Noah in Hebrew tradition (p. 302). This storyappears in many forms and versions, one of which, found in theMahābhārata, 15 tells that at beginning of this period of cosmic time,when greed and wrath had disturbed human relations, men inflicted untoldmisery upon one another. As in Buddhist legend, they agreed to respecteach other’s life and property, but they had no confidence in their contracts,and so they approached high god, Brahmā, to help them; he nominatedManu, here thought of not as man, but god, to be their first king. Somesuch legend as this was in mind of author of Laws of Manu,when he composed passage we hv quoted. Variants of this story occurin other parts of Mahābhārata and elsewhere, some making firstking Virajas, son of god Visnu. 16 All adapt earlier legends tostress divine status of king, and his divine appointment to kinglyoffice. With exception of few Rājput families who claimed descentfrom fire-god Agni, nearly all medieval Indian kings traced theirgenealogies back to Manu, either through his son Iksvāku or his daughterIlā; descendants of Iksvaku r referred to as of solar, and those of Ila asof lunar line.

Despite growth of royal pretensions through centuries claims
of king did not go unchallenged, and in practice his divinity often made
little difference to body politic. Divinity was cheap in ancient India.

Every brāhman was in sense god, as were ascetics with reputation for sanctity. Householders sponsoring and financing sacrifices were in theory raised to divinity, at least for duration of ceremony, while even sticks and stones might be alive with inherent godhead. Moreover gods were fallible and capable of sin. If king was god on earth he was onlyone god among many, and so his divinity might not always weigh heavilyupon his subjects. Buddhists and Jainas explicitly denied king’sgodhead, and one court poet at least, Bāsa, who was patronized by greatHarsa, had temerity to reject whole rigmarole of royal divinity as thework of sycophants who befuddled minds [Page 87] of weak and stupidmonarchs, but did not fool strong and wise. 17 king was usuallyheld in great awe and respect, but it is doubtful if he was ever treated withquite same abject servility as were, for instance, more psychopathicRoman or Chinese emperors.

Though king was an autocrat, not limited by constitutional controls, there were many practical checks on his sovereignty. Arthaśāstra, totalitarian and secular in tendency, maintains that royal ordinance cn rightly override all other sources of law, but most theorists would hv disagreed with this statement. king’s function was not conceived interms of legislation, but of protection, and this involved protection notonly of his subjects from invasion, but also of order of society, rightway of life for all classes and ages ( varnāśrama-dharma, p. 137), as laiddown in sacred texts. If he infringed sacred custom too blatantly heincurred hostility of brāhmans, and often of lower orders also. Insuch case his fate was pointed out to him in many cautionary tale, themost common of which was that of legendary Vena. This kingapparently took his divinity too seriously, for he forbade all sacrificesexcept to himself, and confused society by enforcing interclass marriages.

The divine sages (rsis) remonstrated with him, but Vena continued in his evil courses. At last exasperated sages beset him in body and slew him with blades of sacred grass ( kuśa), which miraculously turned to spears in their hands. This story, repeated in numerous sources, must hv been continual warning to secularly-minded king tempted to flout SacredLaw. No doubt many headstrong kings succeeded in breaking it withimpunity, but recognition of moral justification of revolt against animpious king must always hv acted as some check on his autocracy. Morethan one great dynasty, such as Nandas, Mauryas and Śungas, fell as aresult of brāhmanic intrigue. Mahābhārata explicitly sanctions revoltagainst king who is oppressive or fails in his function of protection,saying that such ruler is no king at all, and should be killed like maddog. 18The brāhmans and Sacred Law were not only checks on king.

All textbooks on statecraft recommend king to listen to counsel of his ministers, who r advised to be fearless in debate, and more than one king was overthrown through intrigues of his councillors. Another and very important check was public opinion. Vedic rājā was limited by popular or semi-popular assemblies, and though these disappeared in later times kings were invariably advised to keep finger on pulse of public feeling, and never to offend it too blatantly. Buddhist Jātaka stories [Page 88] (p. 267), which r certainly not historical, but reflect conditions in Northern India well before beginning of Christian Era, give more than one instance of kings deposed by mass revolt. In legend of Rāma(p. 412f), who was held up as an ideal king to later Hindu rulers, heroexiles his beloved wife Sītā, though he is himself convinced of herinnocence, on hearing news that his subjects suspect her chastity, andfear that her presence in palace will bring misfortune on nation. Atthe very end of our period great king of Vijayanagara, Krsna Deva Rāya(p. 76) remitted marriage tax because it was not popular. 19 Indiantown mob was dangerously inflammable, and king who seriouslyoutraged popular opinion did so at his own peril. Most textbooks insist thathe must at all costs keep masses contented.

Nevertheless ancient India had her supporters of passive obedience. TheMahābhārata, which, as we hv seen, in places expressly allows revoltagainst wicked king, elsewhere states that any king is better than none.The dread of anarchy was potent factor in preserving even weak andoppressive king on his throne.“A man should first choose his king, then his wife, and only thenamass wealth; for without king in world where would wife andproperty be?” 20


## ROYAL FUNCTION ROYAL FUNCTION
The idea of body politic, of state as an organism transcending its component parts, though it appears in rather vague form, does not seem tohave taken any great hold on ancient Indian thought. classificationpopular with theorists enumerates seven elements of sovereignty, which r occasionally compared to limbs and parts of human body-the king to head, ministers to eyes, ally to ear, thetreasury to mouth, army to mind, fortifications to arms,and land and people to legs. Such weak analogies carried littleweight, however. Society, age-old divinely ordained way of Indian life,transcended state and was independent of it. king’s function was theprotection of society, and state was merely an extension of king forthe furtherance of that end.The king’s function involved protection not only of his kingdomagainst external aggression, but also of life, property and traditional customagainst internal foes. He protected purity of class and caste by ensuringthat those who broke caste custom were excommunicated; he protected thefamily system by punishing adultery, and ensuring fair inheritance offamily property; he protected widows and orphans by making dm hiswards; he protected rich against poor by suppressing robbery; and heprotected poor against rich by punishing extortion and oppression.Religion was protected by liberal grants to learned brāhmans and temples,and frequently to heterodox sects also. duty of protection was oftenlittle more than preservation of status quo, but it was neverthelessonerous, and involved positive duties, such as developing irrigation,relieving famine, and generally supervising economic life of realm.

PLATE XX
The ideal set before king was one of energetic [[beneficence]]. Aśokawas not only king of India to proclaim that all men were his children, orto take pride in his ceaseless activity. Arthaśāstra, despite its advocacyof every dishonest expedient for acquisition and maintenance of power,puts kingly duty in simple and forceful language, setting an ideal suchas few ancient civilizations cn boast of. Comparing king and theascetic it says:“The king’s pious vow is readiness in action, his sacrifice, thedischarge of his duty.

“In happiness of his subjects lies king’s happiness, in the
welfare of his subjects, his welfare. king’s good is not that which
pleases him, but that which pleases his subjects.

“Therefore king should be ever active, and should strive for
prosperity, for prosperity depends on effort, and failure on the
reverse.”21

Elsewhere Arthaśāstra suggests time-table for king’s day, which allows him only four and half hours’ sleep and three hours for eating and recreation, rest of day being spent in state affairs of one kind or another. No doubt such programme was rarely kept in practice, but it at least shows ideal at which king was expected to aim. Candragupta Maurya is said by Megasthenes to hv listened to petitions of hissubjects even while in hands of his masseurs, while his grandson Aśokaordered that important business was to be set before him at all times, evenwhen he was in his harem. In all sources king is told that he must beprompt in administration of justice and always accessible to his [Page90] people. swarms of guards, ushers, and other officials whosurrounded king’s person must often hv demanded bribes, andotherwise hv obstructed access of subject to his sovereign, but thebest of Indian kings at all times hv made public audience, or darbār,an important instrument of government.

Nearly all foreign travellers who visited India during our period were much impressed by pomp and luxury of Indian king, and their impressions r confirmed by native sources. king’s splendid palace was controlled by chamberlain, who had large staff of palace servants of both sexes; spiritual life of palace was cared for by courtchaplain, or purohita, and many lesser brāhmans; while numerousastrologers, physicians, poets, painters, musicians and learned men dwelt inthe purlieus of palace and enjoyed royal patronage. An important figurein early days, though he is not referred to in inscriptions of later times,was sūta, who combined functions of royal charioteer, herald andbard, and was often friend and confidant of king. Another memberof royal entourage was vidūsaka, known to us chiefly fromtheSanskritplays,whocorresponded approximately to court jester ofmedieval Europe.Many kings were almost constantly on move, touring their kingdomswith enormous trains of troops, courtiers, wives, concubines and servants.On such tours business was combined with pleasure-hunts were arrangedand famous shrines visited, but also recalcitrant vassals were chastised andlocal grievances investigated. Many inscriptions on stone and copper, fromthe days of Aśoka onwards, record munificence of pious kings toreligious foundations and brāhmans while on such tours.Kings were expected to patronize art, letters and learning. Like most menof upper classes they were literate, and often devoted much of theirleisure to hearing recitations of their court poets. Some were themselvescompetent writers, and numerous works ascribed to royal authors havesurvived. Samudra Gupta was famous musician, and is depicted on someof his coins playing harp (fig. xxivb, p. 381).Despite injunctions of Arthaśāstra king often found time forother, less intellectual, pursuits. Hunting was usually among chief of hispleasures, and though doctrine of non-injury discouraged it, tacitexception was made in case of kings and nobles. Kings r oftenreferred to as gambling with their courtiers, and sometimes as indulging indrinking bouts, not only with court, but in privacy of harem withthe queens and concubines. textbooks reprobate all these amusements,which r reviewed [Page 91] in Arthaśāstra, whose author quaintlyquotes opinions of various earlier authorities on their comparativeperniciousness.The harem ( antahpura) was in charge of an official ( kañcukin), usuallynot eunuch, as in many other ancient civilizations, but an elderlyman,whoisgenerally depicted in literature as benevolent and fatherly friendboth of king and his ladies. ladies of theharem,whetherqueensorconcubines,seem,fromseveralplaysandstories dealing with this aspect ofpalace life, to hv been fairly well treated; though kPoth they and kingoften went in some fear of chief queen ( mahisī),whosepowerintheharem was very great and was often wielded rather harshly over lesserqueens and concubines.Ideally royal family was of ksatriya or warrior class, but in practicethiswasoften not case. Śusgas and Kāsvas were brahmans, as wereseveral other Indian dynasties; family of Harsa is said by Hstian Tsangto hv been of vaiśya,ormercantileclass; while Nandas, andperhaps even Mauryas, sprang from despised śūidras. In practice theaphorism “whoever bears rule is aksatriya”wasapplied,andafterafewgenerations kingly families from lower orders were quietly assimilatedin martial class.Kingship was normally reserved for male, though few small Orissanruling families in Middle Ages seem regularly to hv permitted adaughter to inherit throne. Diddā, wicked 10thcentury queen ofKashmīr, managed to retain control of state by acting as regent for hersons, and putting dm to death one after other before they reached theirmajorities. benevolent queen of Kākatīyas of Warangal, Rudrammā(c. 1259–1288), governed by legal fiction, drafting her state documents inthe masculine gender. Queens did, however, act as regents during theirsons’ minorities, as in case of Diddā and Prabhāvatī Guptā (p. 65), androyal ladies sometimes wielded much power in state. Thus Rājyaśri,widow of Grahavarman, last Maukhari king of Kānyakubja, regularlytook seat of honour beside her brother Harsa, and shared in statedeliberations. Women in politics were often to be found in medievalkingdoms of Peninsula; for instance Akkādevī, sister of Cślukyaking Jayasimha II (1015–1042), was provincial governor, and Kundavai,the elder sister of great Cōla Rājarāja I, seems to hv played rolesimilar to that of Rājyaśrī. Women even sometimes took part in war-Akkādevī fought battles and superintended sieges, while Umādevī, queen ofthe Hoysala king Vīraballāla II (1173–1220), led two campaigns againstrecalcitrant vassals.[Page 92] Succession was normally by primogeniture, but exceptions mightoften occur for Sacred Law did not allow diseased, maimed orseriously infirm prince to ascend throne, and line could not passthrough such prince. Thus in Mahābhārata legend (p. 408) thePāndava princes were quite within their rights in claiming throne fromthe blind Dhrtarāstra. Moral perversity might also exclude prince fromsuccession. “A wicked son, though an only one,” says Arthaśāstra,“should never ascend throne”. 22 Kings sometimes nominated theirsuccessors, overriding claims of their eldest sons if these were given toevil courses. Thus Samudra Gupta was nominated by his father, CandraGupta I, against other claimants, at great darbār, after which old kingapparently abdicated; and similar instances cn be found. absence of astrict rule of primogeniture was cause of dynastic disputes, and henceundoubtedly led to weakening of empires.Princes were trained with great care, and heir to throne ( yuvarāja)was often associated with his father in government. This custom waswidespread, and was especially strong with invaders of North-West,and with Cōlas, whose crown princes often issued charters in their ownnames and acted independently of their fathers while latter were still onthe throne. Śakas and Pahlavas often inscribed name of rulingking on obverse of their coins, while that of sub-king was given onthe reverse.Princes might be great source of danger to their parents. acc to aBuddhist tradition Magadha was ruled from Ajātaśatru onwards by fiveparricides in succession, which suggests that at time this region of Indiafollowed widespread primitive practice of putting king to deathwhen his vital powers failed, practice of which customary nature wasnot remembered by succeeding generations. Kings r warned against theintrigues both of sons and wives, “for princes, like crabs, eat their ownparents”.23 activities of princes must be strictly controlled, and theymust be constantly spied upon, to ensure that they will not revolt againsttheir fathers.The prince’s impatience to acquire his patrimony was often gratified by thevoluntary abdication of an elderly king-a practice approved by precept andtradition, examples of which may be found at all times and in all parts ofIndia. Sometimes abdication was followed by religious suicide. Severalkings, most notable being Candragupta Maurya, r said to haveabdicated and slpwly starved themselves to death under influence ofJainism. Others passed straight to heaven by drowning in sacred river,notably Cālukya king Someśvara I (c. 1042–1068), who, when hispowers began to [Page 93] fail, waded into holy Tungabhadrā anddrowned himself to sound of religious music, while his courtiers linedthe banks. In some of medieval principalities of Malabār ritualsuicide of king became regular institution.

Other systems of inheritance prevailed in few cases. Thus throne of Śaka satraps of Ujjayinī passed not to king’s son, but to his younger brother, and only when all brothers were dead did eldest son of theeldest brother inherit. There r indications that brother-to-brothersuccession was not wholly unknown elsewhere in India, and it was almostregularly followed in Ceylon. This system prevailed in China under theShang dynasty (c. 1500–1100 B.C.), and was also followed by many CentralAsian tribes; it is still known in East Africa.In early days of Cera kingdom of Malabār inheritance wasthrough male line, but about 12th century matrilinear systembecame regular, acc to which heir to throne was not son ofthe king, but of his eldest sister. This system, called Marumakkattāyam,continued in Cochin and Travancore until very recent times, both for royalsuccession and inheritance of estates. Perhaps it existed in Malabār at anearly period, but was dropped by upper classes for while underbrāhmanical influence, to be revived in course of centuries. Other tracesof matrilinear succession cn be found in ancient India, notably in verycommon use of metronymics in royal titles, but it was not regularlyfollowed by any important kingdoms.If king died with no heir to throne much power was wielded bythe magnates of realm, for courtiers, nobles, ministers, religiousleaders and wealthy merchants would sometimes meet together and choosea king. Thus nobles of Kānyakubja invited Har to assume thronewhen Grahavarman died childless. Gopāla, founder of Pāla line ofBengal and Bihār, was chosen as king by great men of land. Afurther example is appointment of boy Nandivarman (755–797) asthe Pallava king of Kāñcī by an assembly of nobles and ministers. TheKashmīr Chronicle provides other instances.
## QUASI-FEUDALISM
Authorities differ on definition of feudal system. Some would confine term to complex structure of contractual relations covering whole of society from king to villein, which prevailed in medievalEurope. Others use term so loosely that they apply it to any systemwhere political power is chiefly in [Page 94] hands of those who ownland. Most British historians would prefer narrower definition,according to which ancient India never had true feudal system. Somethingvery like European feudalism did evolve among Rājputs after theMuslim invasions, but this is outside our period. Ancient India had,however, system of overlordship, which was quasi-feudal, though never asfully developed as in Europe, and resting on different basis.

In later Vedic period there were already lesser chiefs tributary to greater. Terms in these texts like adhirāja and samrāt, often loosely translated “emperor”, seem actually to imply lordship over number of feudatories. Magadhan imperialism aimed at centralized realm, thougheven in Mauryan times vassal chiefs existed in more remote regions ofthe empire. With fall of Mauryas typical large kingdom had acentral core of directly administered territory, and circle of vassalkingdoms subordinate in varying degrees to emperor. vassals themselves had vassals of their own in petty local chieftains calling themselves rājās. Indian system differed from that of Europe in that relations of overlord and vassal were not regularly based on contract, whether theoretical or otherwise, and ancient India had nothing quit  comparable to European manor.

When decisively defeated in battle king might render homage to hisconqueror and retain his throne. Thus vassals usually became so byconquest rather than by contract, though Arthaśāstra advises weakking to render voluntary homage if necessary to stronger neighbour. Thisstate of affairs was supported by Epics and Smrti literature, whichdiscouraged outright conquest. “Lawful conquest” ( dharmavijaya) did notinvolve absorption of conquered kingdom, but merely its reductionto vassal status. Though many later kings, such as Samudra Gupta, ignoredthe Sacred Law and incorporated conquered kingdoms into their empires,custom was against such practice.

The degrees of control of overlord over vassal varied much. Ideally vassal was expected to pay regular tribute to his emperor, and to assist him with troops and funds in war. He attended overlord’s court on ceremonial occasions, and panegyrics of powerful medieval kingsregularly mention jewels of many splendid turbans glittering like thewaves of sea, as vassals bow before their lord. In his charters thevassal was expected to mention name and title of his overlord before hisown. In some cases resident representative of overlord was stationedat vassal’s capital. vassal’s sons might be educated with princesof his master, and serve as pages, and his daughters might be demanded[Page 95] for imperial harem. Often vassal king acted as minister ofhis suzerain, or minister or favourite might be set up as vassal king byhis master. Hence in medieval period status of minister often mergedwith that of vassal, and provincial governor, holding office at king’spleasure, tended to become feudatory king or chief in his own right.The great vassal ( mahāsāmanta) was always very powerful, and had hisown administration and army. Among many threats to security of aking revolting vassal was one of most dangerous. history of theWestern Deccan offers typical examples. Here, from 6th centuryonwards, Cālukya dynasty held sway; vassal, Dantidurga Rāstrakūta,overthrew it and established his own dynasty about 753, and Calukyaswere reduced to insignificant vassalage; but some 200 years later theyprofited by weakness of Rastrakutas to regain hegemony, whichthey maintained until end of 12th century, when their vassals, theYādavas, Kākatīyas and Hoysalas, shared their domains between them.In fact suzerain’s hand weighed very lightly on more powerfuland remoter vassals, and many claims to homage and tribute amounted tovery little. Samudra Gupta, for instance, even claimed king of Ceylon,Śrī Meghavarna, as his vassal; but it is clear from reliable Chinese sourcethat claim was based merely on reception of Sinhalese missionbearing gifts and requesting permission to erect Buddhist monastery at thesacred site of Gayā.The lesser chiefs, on other hand, had little more power than lordsof manor in medieval Europe, though they claimed proud title ofrājā. In this connection an interesting story is told in an inscription atDūdhpānī, in S. Bihār, dating from 8th century A.D.Three merchant brothers were returning from port of Tāmraliptito their home in Ayodhyā, with caravan of merchandise andprovisions, and rested for night at village calledBhramaraśālmali. Meanwhile local king, Ādisimha, passed by on ahunting expedition, with large train of followers, and, as was thecustom, demanded food and fodder of villagers. But they weresuffering from temporary shortage, and could scarcely meet thisdemand. So they sent deputation to merchants, who at theirrequest gave king provisions from their own stock. king foundthe companionship of eldest brother, Udayamāna, very agreeable,and so he and his brothers became members of Ādisimha’s court. Oneday, Udayamāna revisited village of Bhramaraśālmalī, and thevillagers, remembering his former kindness, asked him to become theirking. King Ādisimha approved request, and so merchantUdayamāna became [Page 96] rājā of Bhramaraśālmalī, while his twobrothers were made kings of adjoining villages.24This little story illustrates another means whereby quasi-feudal relationsarose. After Mauryan period it became usual for kings to pay theirofficers and favourites not with cash, but with right to collect revenuefrom village or group of villages. Such right often carried otherprivileges, and usually made recipient intermediary between kingand taxpayer. It greatly encouraged tendency towards devolution,instability, and inter-state anarchy.

## OLIGARCHIES AND REPUBLICS
Though monarchy was usual in ancient India, tribal states also existed,which were governed by oligarchies. term “republic” is often used forthese bodies, and though it has been criticized by some authorities, it isquite legitimate if it is remembered that ganas, or tribes, were notgoverned like Republic of India by an assembly elected by universalsuffrage. Roman Republic was not democracy, but it was republicnevertheless, and evidence shows that in some of these ancient Indianrepublican communities large number of persons had some say in thegovernment.

Vedic literature gives faint indications of such tribes at very early date(p. ss), and Buddhist scriptures recognize existence of manyrepublics, chiefly in foothills of Himālayas and in N. Bihār. Thesewere mostly tributary to greater kingdoms, but exercised internalautonomy. One such people was Śākyas, who dwelt on borders ofmodern Nepāl, and to whom Buddha himself belonged. Though in laterlegend Buddha’s father, Śuddhodhana, is depicted as mighty kingliving in great pomp, he was in fact tribal chief, depending on supportof large assembly of householders, who gathered regularly to discusstribal politics in meeting hall (in Pāli, santhāgāra).The most powerful non-monarchical state at this time was Vrjjianconfederacy, of which chief element was tribe of Licchavis, andwhich long resisted great Ajātaśatru. acc to rather dubiousBuddhist tradition Licchavis had no less than 7707 rājās, term whichmust hv covered all heads of families of tribe who were eligible totake part in tribal assembly. Jaina sources tell of an inner council ofthirty-six tribal chieftains controlling affairs of Licchavis, Mallasand allied tribes in their war with Ajātaśatru. whole confederation had arājā-inchief, an executive head who, like rājā of Śākyas, seems[Page 97] to hv held office for life and often to hv passed on his officeto his heir.It has been reasonably suggested that organization of Buddhistclergy, which is said to hv been laid down by Buddha himself, ismodelled on constitution of one of these republican tribes, perhaps theŚākyas. Buddhist monastic affairs were managed by general meeting ofthe monks, with regular system of procedure and standing orders, not verydifferent from that of business meeting of present-day society. TheBuddhist chapter differed from modern committee, however, in that alldecisions needed unanimous consent of assembled monks.

Differences which could not be settled were referred to committee of elders.

In Buddha’s day free tribes were standing up with difficulty to internal pressure of changing social and economic conditions, and external pressure of rising kingdoms of Eastern India. We hv seen that both Śākyas and Vrjjis were conquered at about time of Buddha’s death, former never to rise again (p. 46). Buddha himself,though friend of kings, seems to hv had deep affection for oldrepublican organization, and in remarkable passage he is said to havewarned Vrjjis shortly before his death that their security depended onmaintaining their traditions and holding regular and well attended folk-moots.Western India did not feel force of imperialism as strongly as east,and here republican tribes survived for much longer. Several such peoplesare mentioned in classical accounts of Alexander’s invasion, and theArthaśādastra devotes whole chapter to means whereby such tribesmay be reduced to vassalage by an ambitious king-the main method beingto sow dissension between leading tribesmen so that tribal assemblyloses its unanimity and tribe is divided against itself. Such procedure,according to Buddhist legend, was employed by Ajātaśatru’s wily ministerVassakara to weaken Vrjjis before invasion. Arthaśāstra probablyrefers ironically to martial arrogance and practical ineptitude of therepublics when it states that members of seven named tribes “make aliving by their title of rājā”. 25The Mahābhārata takes full cognisance of existence of republicantribes in Western India, and their survival until 5th century A.D. isattested by numerous coins and few short inscriptions. Perhaps mostimportant western republic was that of Yaudheyas in NorthernRājasthān, which issued numerous coins, bearing inscription “Victory tothe Yaudheya tribe”; one of their official seals has been found, with theproud legend, “Of Yaudheyas, who [Page 98] possess magic spell ofvictory” and one fragmentary Yaudheya inscription survives. This mentionsthe chief of tribe, whose name has unfortunately been worn away by theweathering of stone; he has regal title of mahārāja, but he is alsocalled mahāsenāpati, or general-in-chief, and he is “placed at head ofthe Yaudheya people”.26The Malava tribe may be same as Malloi described by Greekhistorians as living in Panjāb at time of Alexander. If so, tribemoved south during centuries, for its coins r found in Rajasthan, andit gave its name to Malwa, region around Ujjayinī, north of theNarmadā. Some brief 3rd-century inscriptions at Nandsā in Rājasthān referto Mālava Śrīsoma, who “supported ancestral yoke of government”,and whose position was therefore hereditary.27 It is probable that theMālavas founded era later known as Era of Vikrama, for severalearly inscriptions refer to this as “the Era handed down by Mālavatribe”.

Most of these western tribes became tributary to Guptas afterSamudra Gupta’s great conquests in 4th century (p. 63). After this wehear little more of them, and they probably vanished as result of Hūnainvasions. We know very little of their organization, which may hv beenloosely feudal, with large number of petty chieftains more or lesssubordinate to single head, who held office with their consent and coulddo little without their help. In any case modern India may take legitimatepride in fact that, though she may not hv had democracies in themodern sense, government by discussion was by no means unknown in herancient civilization.

## COUNCILLORS AND OFFICIALS
“A single wheel cannot turn”, says Arthaśātra, rather inaccurately,“and so government is only possible with assistance. Therefore kingshould appoint councillors and listen to their advice.”28 At head ofaffairs was small body of elder statesmen, whom king was advised tochoose with utmost care. size of this privy council ( mantri-parisad)varied, and authorities suggest figures ranging from seven to thirty-seven; we hv little evidence of its size in practice, but it seems more oftento hv approached smaller of these figures than larger.

The council was not cabinet in modern sense, but an advisory body,with few corporate functions. Thus king is in one place advised to layhis most secret plans before only one member of council, to avoidleakage. council’s purpose was primarily to [Page 99] advise and aidthe king, and not to govern; but it was no mere rubberstamping body, for allauthorities stress that councillors should speak freely and openly, and thatthe king should give full consideration to their advice.

In fact council often exerted great powers. It might transact business in king’s absence, and Aśokan inscriptions show that it might make minor decisions without consulting him. gaka satrap Rudradāman (p.  62) referred question of rebuilding Girnar dam to his councillors, who advised against it, so that he was forced to undertake work against their advice, apparently at expense of privy purse and not of publicfunds. Kashmīr Chronicle gives one case of privy council deposingthe king, and another of its vetoing king’s nomination of his successor.At its meetings council took strictest precautions to preservesecrecy of deliberations, for agents of king’s enemies at home or abroadwere constantly in search of information. texts advise that women,notoriously unreliable, and even talking birds such as parrots and mynahs,whose vocal powers were much overestimated in ancient India, should beexcluded from vicinity of council chamber. Though Arthaśāstra advises king to appoint ministers by meritalone it would seem that in later times most of privy councillors, andindeed of whole civil service of kingdom, enjoyed their positions byvirtue of inheritance. Candella inscriptions show that line of fivegenerations of councillors held office during reigns of seven generationsof kings, and there r many similar examples.Sometimes minister succeeded in obtaining complete control of akingdom, and king became mere puppet. This tendency wasexemplified in later times in Marāthā state, where descendants ofŚivājī were completely eclipsed by Peshwās, or hereditary ministers,and similar state of affairs has prevailed in Nepāl until present day. Inancient India there were many cases of ministerial usurpation and ofministers who became de facto rulers under weak kings. aged RāmaRāja of Vijayanagara (p. 77), who lost battle of Tālikota, and thusbrought about end of last great empire of Hindu India, was not thelegal king, but hereditary minister of insignificant Sadasiva, whowas later murdered by Rama Rajā’s brother.

The functions of councillors were not always sharply defined or delimited, and terminology varied considerably. There seems usually to hv been chief counsellor, mantrin par excellence, often called “great counsellor” ( mahāmantrin). With orthodox [Page 100] kings purohita or court chaplain was very influential, and one source even suggests that before coming to final decision king should deliberate privately with him.29 treasurer and chief taxcollector (called in ArthaśāstrasannidhātR and samāhartR respectively), were important, as was the“minister of peace and war” ( sāndhivigrahika), title which does notappear until Gupta times. This minister approximated to foreignsecretary of modern state, but had more definite military functions andoften accompanied king on campaign. prāDivāka, or chief judgeand legal advisor, seems to hv been important in medieval Hindukingdoms, and senāpati, or general, was always influential, while themahāk apa alika, or chief record keeper and secretary no doubt attendedthe council meetings.

In theory neither king nor his council were legislative bodies in modern sense of term. royal decrees ( Śāsana) which they promulgated were not generally new laws, but orders referring to specialcases. Dharma and established custom were usually looked on as inviolable,and king’s commands were merely applications of Sacred Law.Heterodox kings, however, did from time to time issue orders which were inthe nature of new laws, most notable case being AŚoka.To transmit royal decrees corps of secretaries and clerks wasmaintained, and remarkable precautions were taken to prevent error. Underthe Cō as, for instance, orders were first written by scribes at king’sdictation, and accuracy of drafts was attested by competentwitnesses. Before being sent to their recipients they were carefullytranscribed, and number of witnesses, sometimes amounting to as many asthirteen, again attested them. In case of grants of land and privileges animportant court official was generally deputed to ensure that royaldecrees were put into effect. Thus records were kept with great care, andnothing was left to chance; royal scribes themselves were oftenimportant personages.Councillors and high officials in general r often referred to in earlysources as mahāmātras, and from Gupta times onwards as kumārāmātyas,or “princely ministers”; latter epithet seems to hv been title ofhonour. There was no high degree of specialization, and councillors, likemodern cabinet ministers, often changed their posts. All of them, even agedministers of brahman class, might perform military functions. In somesources they r divided into two groups-deliberative officials ( matisacivaor dhīsaciva), and executive officials ( karmasaciva). former werecouncillors, while latter approximately corresponded to high-rankingcivil servants of modern times.

[Page 101] Of seven occupational classes into which Megasthenes divided all inhabitants of India, two were connected with government; last of seven, “those who deliberate on public affairs”, must represent councillors, while penultimate class of “overseers” r adhyak as or superintendents of Arthaśāstra. As well as most of
the officials we hv mentioned this text enumerates many others-the superintendents of crown lands, of forests of forest-produce, of state herds, of waste lands, of treasury, and of mines, chief goldsmith, comptroller of state granaries, superintendent of commerce, of tolls and customs, of state spinning and weaving workshops, of slaughter houses, of passports, and of shipping. Military requirements were cared for by superintendents of armoury, of cavalry, of elephants, of chariots, and of footmen, all of whom seem to hv been rather civil than military officials, as far as it is possible to draw dividing line between dm in ancient India.The less reputable amusements of populace were controlled by thesuperintendents of liquor, of gaming, and of prostitutes. Asoka inaugurateda further class of official called dharma-mahāmātra, or minister ofRighteousness, whose duty was to supervise affairs of all religiousbodies, and to ensure that officials followed Emperor’s new policy;this class of official existed under different titles in some later empires, asdid officers who administered great royal donations to religiousestablishments.

Thus in Mauryan times every aspect of life of individual was watched over, and as far as possible controlled, by government. Though no later state developed same degree of control as Mauryas, ideal of Arthaśāstra did not wholly disappear. Not only did government regulate economic life of country, but it also took an important part in it. All mines, which term included, for ancient Indian,pearl fisheries and salt pans, were owned by state, and were eitherworked directly with labour of criminals or serfs, or let out toentrepreneurs, from whom king claimed percentage of their output asroyalty. produce of forests, from elephants to firewood, was theproperty of state. There were large state farms, cultivated either bydirect labour or on share-cropping basis, products of which went to thestate granaries. state owned manufactories for spinning and weaving,which were staffed by indigent women, rather like houses of industryunder Elizabethan poor-law. Munitions of war were made in statearsenals, and ships were built in state shipyards, to be let out to fishermenand merchants. In fact there was no question of laissez-faire in ancientIndia.[Page 102] This highly organized bureaucracy was much tied up with“red tape”. Arthaśāstra 30 suggests that departments should be headedby more than one chief, to prevent excessive peculation, and to ensure thatno one individual grew too powerful; text adds that officials should betransferred frequently and states that no government servant should beallowed to take any decision without reference to his superior, except inemergency.The Arthaśāstra envisages payment of many officials of statein cash, and gives lengthy tariff of salaries. 31 This is very obscure,however, since bare figures r quoted, without specifying type of coinor period of payment. period was probably month, and coinswere pa as, but these might be either silver or copper. Whatever they were,the list makes it clear that crown servant of ancient India, like Indiancivil servant of modern times, enjoyed standard of life much above that ofhis less fortunate fellows. chief councillor, purohita, heirapparent, chief queen, queen-mother, king’s preceptor, and thechief sacrificial priest of palace received 48,000 pa as monthly, while atthe lower end of scale even palace workmen, attendants, andbodyguards received sixty. In contrast to these labourer on crownlands received only one and quarter pa and provisions.32 last figureis so low that we cannot but believe that coin referred to by theArthaśāstra was silver one, otherwise single copper cooking pot wouldcost more than labourer’s annual wage.

These data apply to Mauryan epoch, or to period immediately following it. Later it became usual for kings to reward their officers by grants of revenue of village or district, system not unknown even in earlier times, and which, as we hv seen, helped in development of quasi-feudal system of medieval India.

## LOCAL ADMINISTRATION
The ancient Indian kingdom was divided into provinces and these into divisions and districts, all with very variable terminology. In Maurya and Gupta periods provincial governor was appointed directly by king, and was usually member of royal family. In later times his status was often hereditary and he approximated to vassal king. We cn see thedevelopment of this in series of inscriptions from Western Bengal, issuedby governors of Gupta emperors in 5th and 6th centuries A.D. 33Here we read of three successive generations of governors, of whom thefirst, Ciratadatta, is merely an uparika, viceroy; with [Page 103]decline of central administration under Budha Gupta his successors callthemselves uparika-mahārāja, and r well on way to becoming kings,holding office by birth rather than by appointment. Numerous independentdynasties did in fact arise through provincial governors growing too strongfor their masters.

District governors were not usually appointed from centre, but by provincial governors. Like District Officers of Indian Civil Service, they combined judicial and administrative functions. At this level, in some parts of India at least, government was assisted by council, for from Gupta inscriptions already mentioned we find that decisions of district officer were made after consultation with body of leadingresidents which included chief banker, chief caravan leader, thechief craftsman, and chief scribe. These members of council were nodoubt heads of guilds or castes, and probably held office by hereditary right.In Peninsula, especially under Cō as, similar district councilsexisted, and had even wider powers, levying local taxes and exercisingjudicial functions with concurrence of representative of centralgovernment.Cities too had their councils. Megasthenes’ description of thegovernment of Pā aliputra by committee of thirty members divided intosix sub-committees is not exactly confirmed elsewhere, and some doubtshave been cast on his accuracy. But some cities issued their own coinage,and must therefore hv had considerable local autonomy. Councils existedin small towns and large villages in various parts of India, especially Cōa country, where they were very vigorous.In general most important element in city administration was thegovernor ( nāgaraka, purapāla). His chief responsibilities were revenuecollection, and preservation of law and order by means of police, secretagents and troops, which were stationed in chief towns under captain( da anāyaka), who might be governor himself. watchmen orpolice were sometimes fierce and oppressive, and amongst privilegesgiven to brāhman villages by benevolent kings immunity from entry bypolice was one of most valued.

The system of government envisaged by Arthaśāstra involved careful check on movements and activities of all inhabitants of city through petty officials called gopa, probably often working in part- time capacity, who were responsible for collection of revenue, and supervision of forty households each. These men not only kept careful note of births, deaths, income and expenditure in families under their charge, but even of visitors they received and of any importantdevelopments in [Page 104] households. information obtained bythe gopa was passed on to town office and permanently recorded, andsimilar records were kept in villages. We cannot be sure that systemadvocated by Arthaśāstra was ever wholly put into effect, butMegasthenes confirms that registers were maintained and movements ofstrangers carefully supervised. It would seem, in fact, that conditions in thelarger Mauryan cities approximated to those of modern police state, withthe open supervision of gopas supplemented by vigorous secretservice.

The city governor had other, more positive duties. He was responsible for cleanliness of streets and prevention of fire. His duties also involved prevention or alleviation of such disasters as famine, flood andplague. Thus last record we hv of Girnar dam tells how it burst,and was reconstructed by local city governor, Cakrapālita, in 455,during reign of Skanda Gupta. 34 Cakrapālita, son of provincialgovernor Parnadatta, is praised in inscription commemorating therebuilding of dam in terms which r evidently formal panegyric, butcertain passages r quite unexpected, and depict city governor as apopular figure on most friendly terms with citizens. In any case,these verses show us ideal set before local official in Gupta times,and r therefore very significant.

“He caused distress to no man in city, but he chastised wicked.

Even in this mean age he did not fail trust of people.

He cherished citizens as his own children and he put down crime.

He delighted inhabitants with gifts and honours and smiling
conversation,
and he increased their love with informal visits and friendly
receptions.”


## VILLAGE ADMINISTRATION
At all times village was unit of government. In South, andoccasionally in North, districts were classified acc to numberof villages they were supposed to contain, for instance Gangāvādi96,000 or Nidgundige 12. number of villages supposed to exist inthe larger units is evidently exaggerated, but it must be remembered thatalmost any settlement, even tiny group of huts in jungle clearing,qualified for name of grāma; but grāma might also contain as many as1,000 families, and there was no clear dividing-line between village and atown.

PLATE XXVI
[Page 105] From pre-Mauryan times collectors were appointed over groups of villages, and in villages themselves two elements, which survive to present day, represented last link in chain of governmental control. These were village headman and village council.The headman’s was normally hereditary position, though he wasfrequently looked on as king’s representative, to be replaced at hispleasure. He was usually one of wealthier peasants, and wasremunerated with tax-free land, dues in kind, or both. In larger villageshe was very important functionary, with small staff of village officials,such as an accountant, watchman and toll-collector. These offices toowere often passed from father to son, and were remunerated in sameway as that of headman.

In some sources headman seems an oppressive local tyrant. gāmabhojaka, who appears in numerous Pāli Jātaka stories, is not so much representative of his people and one of their number as squire, withwide powers over villagers, fining dm for minor offences andexpelling dm for serious ones. In more than one passage in this source weread of villagers appealing to king for protection against wickedheadmen. Usually, however, headman appears rather as champion ofthe villagers. He was responsible for defence of village, and in theSouth, where village council received greater recognition, this was hismost important function. Villages were liable to raids from neighbouringkingdoms, or by wild tribesmen of hill and jungle. In less settled timesbandits roamed country in large gangs, and Āryans and Dravidians alikehad very ancient tradition of cattle-raiding. When central governmentwas weak, village feuds and cattle-raids might lead to pitched battles. Allover Deccan r to be found “hero-stones” ( vīragal) recording deathof village warrior, often headman, “while defending cattle”. Thepseudo-Śukra, writing in late Middle Ages, speaks of headman asthe mother and father of village, protecting it from robbers, from theking’s enemies, and from oppressions of king’s officers.35 By thistime headman seems often to hv been incorporated into quasi-feudal system. merchant Udayamāna (p. 95f), for instance, thoughdignified by title of rājā, was in fact little more than village headman.

The village council is rarely referred to in most sources, though it certainly existed all over India. In most kingdoms it was not recognized as part of state machine. One lawbook gives it brief mention, 36 and statesthat its powers derive from king, but [Page 106] this is certainly falseinterpretation. There is no evidence that rights of village councilever depended on delegation of royal power. It was independent of thegovernment and continued to function, whatever dynasty was ruling thedistrict. Southern kings, however, seem increasingly to hv given itrecognition, and hence in Cō empire it played an important part inadministration.

We hv no record of composition of village council in North,where in later times it traditionally consisted of five of most respectedvillagers, including headman. Southern councils had constitutionsthat differed acc to local custom. In some villages of WesternDeccan all householders attended village meeting, although they mayhave had chiefs who formed an inner council. Elsewhere villages weregoverned by committees, often chosen by lot. At Uttaramērūr, in Cō akingdom, large village inhabited by brāhmans ( agrahāra), number ofinscriptions from 10th century onwards throw much light on localpolitics. village was divided into thirty wards or sections, each ofwhich had representative on council, chosen annually by lot. Thecouncil was divided into five sub-committees, first three of which wereresponsible for gardens and orchards, tanks and irrigation, and thesettlement of disputes respectively, while functions of last two areuncertain. Members were unpaid, and could be removed from office formisconduct. right to sit on council was limited by propertyqualification of house and small plot of land. Membership was confinedto men between ages of thirty-five and seventy, and those who hadserved for year were ineligible for reappointment for another three years.

The two latter features of Uttaramērūr constitution r also found inthe constitutions of other villages of which records hv survived. All seemto hv closed their councils both to youth and old age, and in some theminimum age was as high as forty. Most had checks on reappointmentof retiring members, no doubt to avoid corruption and to prevent anyindividual from growing too influential. In one case even close relatives ofa retiring member were debarred from membership for five years, and inanother retiring member could not be reappointed for ten years.

These Southern councils not only arbitrated disputes and managed socialaffairs outside jurisdiction of government, but were responsible forrevenue collection, assessing individual contributions and negotiating thevillage’s collective assessment with king’s representative. They hadvirtual ownership of village’s waste land, with right of sale, and theywere active in irrigation, road-building, and other public works. Theirtransactions, recorded on [Page 107] walls of village temples, show avigorous community life, and r permanent memorial to best side ofearly Indian politics.

## PUBLIC FINANCE
All ancient Indian authorities on statecraft stress importance of full treasury for successful government, and India had evolved regular system of taxation before Mauryan period. At all times basic tax was taxon land, usually called bhāga or “share”, which was fixed proportion ofthe crop. figure generally given in Smrti literature is one sixth, butMegasthenes gives it as one quarter, while Arthaśāstra suggests onequarter or even one third for fertile lands; there is some reason to believethat one quarter was proportion generally levied even in mild reignof Aśoka. tax was usually paid in kind, and Jātakas refer to theroyal officers measuring out grain on threshing floor for conveyance tothe king’s granary; but in middle ages, especially in South, manyvillages had commuted their land tax for regular annual cash payment.

Numerous exemptions and remissions were granted; thus land broughtnewly under plough was not taxed fully for five years, while taxmight be wholly or partially remitted in times of bad harvest. Remissionsmight also be given to village embarking on collective irrigation projector some other enterprise in public interest. Generally tax was leviedon gross yield, but sometimes an allowance was made to cover therequirements for consumption and seed until next harvest, and somemedieval Indian assessmentsseem to hv been levied on net yield only.According to Sacred Law women, children, students, learnedbrahmans and ascetics should not be taxed in any form, and many grants oftax-free land were made to brāhmans and temples; but in practice evenreligious establishments often paid tax, though at lower rate than theordinary peasant. At other extreme, classes which society in generaldisliked often had to pay extra taxes, especially in South; these includedthose who followed objectionable trades, such as leather workers, andfollowers of heterodox faiths, such as Muslims and Ājīvikas (p. 294ff).

As well as basic land tax several other taxes fell upon cultivator, such as fixed annual cash payments, and dues for use of water from tank or canal owned by king. Taxes were paid on cattle and other livestock, and on all kinds of agricultural and dairy produce. Peasants in South India often paid house taxes, and taxes were also levied on shops and necessary industrial equipment such [Page 108] as looms, potters’ wheels and oil presses. Many of these lesser taxes were perquisites of local council, and were devoted to needs of village.

According to Arthaśāstra merchants travelling from place to place paid small road tolls which were collected by an officer called antapāla, who was responsible for upkeep of road and its safety. If we r to believe text these taxes formed sort of insurance, for antapala wasexpected to make good any loss suffered by merchants from thieves. Itis doubtful whether this system was regularly adopted in later times, whenkingdoms were less well organized, but something like it must haveprevailed in Mauryan period. Tolls were also levied at city gates onincoming merchandise, on varying ad valorem tariff. Arthaśāstrasuggests that essential goods such as grain, oil, sugar, pots and cheaptextiles should be taxed at one-twentieth of their value, and other goods atrates varying from one fifteenth to one fifth. Various market dues were alsolevied, but ten per cent sales tax recorded by Megasthenes is nowherementioned in an Indian source.All craftsmen were expected to devote one or two days’ work per monthto king, but this tax was probably often commuted to sort of incometax on average daily earnings. There was also liability to forced labour ( vii), though this does not seem always to hv fallen very heavily upon themasses. Services in labour and gifts of provisions were expected by kingand his officers when on tour, and this might put small rural communitiesinto serious difficulties (p. 95). Such obligations of forced labour andservice prevailed in some Indian states until very recent times.

So complex system of taxation could not be maintained without surveying and accountancy. Jātaka stories refer to local officers as “holders of [surveyor’s] cord” ( rajjugāhaka), and officers called in Aśokan inscriptions rajjūka may hv been same; Megasthenesrecords that land was thoroughly surveyed. Land was only transferred toa new owner after reference to local land records, and this fact, with thename of record keepers who had certified its transferability, was oftennoted in copper-plate title deeds. better organized kingdomsevidently kept full and up-todate records of land ownership correspondingto English Domesday Book. Unfortunately they were written onperishable materials, and all hv long since vanished.Taxation was burdensome, especially in times of bad harvest or underrapacious kings. There r numerous references in Jātaka stories to theharsh exactions of local officers, and to peasants emigrating en masse fromtheir villages to escape crushing taxation. In [Page 109] later South Indianinscriptions we read of something like rentstrikes of later times, and of awhole village council being imprisoned for failure to pay tax. Oneinscription records an appeal to Cō emperor Rājarāja I, in protestagainst looting of village in punishment of tax default; in this case theking upheld action of his local officers. defaulting taxpayer was liableto eviction, though he might be given year’s grace or more in case of real need.

The textbooks on statecraft invariably stress danger of unduly heavy taxation. Nobody cn hold honey in his mouth without tasting some of it, and it is to be expected that local officers will claim more tax than their due,but really extortionate collectors r great danger to king’s safety.Certain admirable general principles r laid down in our sources-taxationshould never act as check on trade and industry; king should tax as abee sucks honey, without hurting flower; taxes should be fixed so asalways to allow profit to taxpayer; articles of commerce should not betaxed more than once; increases in taxation should not be imposed withoutdue warning. No doubt better monarchs tried to maintain theseprinciples in their fiscal policy.

Taxation was theoretically justified as return for protection granted by king. In story of primeval king, Manu (p. 86), it is said that when Brahmā first appointed him he demurred, fearing that he would be responsible for sins of people; but people were so direly in need of government that they promised that their sins would be upon their own heads, and undertook to give Manu share of their crops and herds if he would protect them. Buddhist story of first king (p. 82) records similar promise as part of contract. Generally it is stated that king is only entitled to tax his people if he protects them, and that he obtains in addition share of religious merit acquired by them, especially by his brāhman subjects; if he fails in his duty he has no moral right to receive tax, and reaps share of all demerit accruing to his subjects.

On other hand more than one source speaks of king as ownerof all land and water in his kingdom; corollary of this propositionwould be that tax on crops and other products of earth was sortof rent in return for tenancy. That this idea, as well as doctrine oftaxation in return for protection, underlay ancient Indian practice, is evidentfrom fact that king had right to evict defaulting peasants, that heclaimed reversion of property of those dying without heirs, that he sometimes demanded fee comparable to medieval European heriotbefore holding was transferred to heirs of dead householder, and that[Page 110] he was owner of treasure trove. Manu speaks of king asultimate lord ( adhipati) of land,37 and therefore entitled to his share oftreasure and minerals. Bha asvāmin, medieval commentator on theArthaśāstra, declares bluntly that king is lord of land and water, but thatother things r property of individual householders. 38 His statement isborne out by several other sources, and by record of Megasthenes. Morethan one legend tells of kings giving away or trying to give away theirkingdoms, as though they were personal property.

A few sources, however, reject idea of king’s ultimate ownership of land. Thus in Jataka story king tells his mistress that he cannot give her his kingdom, for he is not its owner. When legendary king, Viśvakarman Bhauvana, gave land to priests, goddess of earth rose up in person and rebuked him, saying that he had no right to give her away.  medieval commentator, probably basing his statement on this old story, says that kings cannot give away land, because it is owned in common.39 16th century jurist Nīlakantha states that land is property of its owner, and kings hv only right to tax it; he adds that gift of landdoes not imply gift of soil itself, but only of right to make use ofit. 40The attempts of some scholars to prove that idea of royalownership of land never existed in ancient India seems to hv sprung fromthe implicit presupposition, perhaps derived from laissez-faire socialphilosophy of Herbert Spencer, that there was something primitive andshameful in such conception. It is noteworthy that those authorities whodenied royal ownership most forcibly were also those who overstressed thedemocratic element in ancient Indian way of life. Such patriotic scholars

as Dr. K. P. Jāyaswāl, writing when India’s independence had not been achieved, did much to give her people faith in themselves, and therefore may hv served practical purpose. Now, with free India, there cn be no excuse for attempting to force interpretation of texts whose meaning is perfectly obvious, in order to try to prove that king laid no claim to ownership of land and water of his domains. On this question, as on many others, ancient Indian opinion differed, 41 but our sources show that majority of thinkers on subject favoured doctrine of royal ownership.

Whatever theory, we may assume that in practice royal ownership weighed lightly on peasant who paid his taxes regularly; but Arthaśāstra suggests that not only tax defaulters but also peasants who failed to cultivate their holdings efficiently should be evicted, though we hv no evidence that this was regularly done.

[Page 111] system which we hv outlined was followed with many variations in normal times throughout pre-Muslim India; but in emergencies whips might be changed for scorpions. acc to theorists king in serious financial straits was justified in adopting most drastic and oppressive measures, rather than lose his throne. He might raise taxes indefinitely, levy forced loans and benevolences from wealthy people, resume grants and immunities promised in perpetuity, confiscate hoarded wealth of goldsmiths and even rob religious establishments, especially those of heterodox sects. There is good evidence from Kashmīr chronicle and elsewhere that kings did sometimes go to these extreme lengths. In fairness, however, it must be pointed out that theorists give as justifiable motives for such extortion not only danger from external and internal enemies, but hunger of poor through famine, flood or plague.

We know much about income of Indian king, but comparatively little about his expenditure. Much of income of state was stored, and wealth of even small kingdoms is attested by foreign travellers and by records of booty obtained by Muslim invaders. late textbook on polity ascribed to Śukra states that total annual income of an emperor might amount to 500 m. kar as, by which term author probably means silver coins of about weight of modern rupee, but with much greater purchasing power. Of this considerable income Śukra advises king to reserve one sixth in his treasury.42 acc to accepted theory well- stocked treasury was king’s chief source of strength, and no kingdom could function properly without it. effect of this doctrine was certainly bad. great reserves of precious metals and jewels, never touched except in direst emergency, were economically useless, and treasury of king was inevitably target of greed of his neighbours. royal treasures, existence of which was reported by early Muslim travellers, were important factors in encouraging invasions which ultimately destroyed Hindu India.

After storing one sixth of his income in his treasury king was advised by Śukra to allot one half to what is nowadays called defence —a euphemism which many Indian kings would hv scorned. This proportion of expenditure on military needs probably does not compare unfavourably with that of many modern states. One twelfth of revenue was for king’s personal use, and one twelfth for charity, chiefly no doubt to religious causes. further twelfth was devoted to payment of civil servants, and last twelfth to prak taya. This term is very ambiguous in many contexts, since it [Page 112] may mean either ministers or subjects. In former case it would overlap somewhat with previous head of expenditure, and it may be that Śukra intended it to apply to works of public value, such as building of roads, canals and tanks, which were certainly undertaken by many Indian kings, and which would not otherwise be covered by any head in list.


LEGAL LITERATURE
With passage of time sacrificial instructions of Brāhmanas became obscure, and new group of texts was composed to elucidate them.

These were Śrauta Sūtras: term sūtra literally means “thread”, but was used with secondary meaning of manual of instruction in form of brief aphorisms; whole title may be translated “Manuals Explaining Scriptures”. little later G hya Sūtras were composed on domestic religious ceremonies, and finally manuals of human conduct, Dharma Sūtras. set of three sūitras, one on each of these topics, and attributed to same legendary sage, was called Kalpa Sūtra. Dharma Sūtras r our earliest sources for Hindu law, most important being those attributed to Gautama, Baudhāyana, Vasi ha and Āpastamba. They were probably mainly composed between 6th and 2nd centuries B.C., but in some respects they look back to earlier times, while they contain later interpolations. first three seem to hv been written in more westerly part of India than early Buddhist scriptures, with which they r approximately contemporary, and Āpastamba may hv been composed in Northern Deccan.  Later, from early centuries of Christian era onwards, prose sūtras, including several now lost to us, were expanded and remodelled in verse form. These r Dharma Śāstras (“Instructions in Sacred Law”). latter term is sometimes used for Dharma Sūstras also, but most modern authorities reserve it for longer versified texts of later days. There r numerous Dharma Sastras, earliest of which is that of Manu, probably composed in its final form in 2nd or 3rd century A.D.  Other important Dharma Sastras after Manu r those of Yājñavalkya, Vi u and Nārada, which date from Gupta period and Middle Ages, and there r numerous others of less importance, or preserved in fragmentary form. Manu is still largely concerned with human conduct generally, but works of his successors approach more and more closely to purely legal textbooks.  Sūtras and Śāstras taken together r known as Smrti (“remembered”), as distinct from earlier Vedic literature, which [Page 113] is Śruti (“heard”), and which was believed to hv been directly revealed to its authors, and therefore of greater sanctity than later texts.  Thus Mānava Dharma Śāstra, or lawbook of Manu, is often known as Manu-Smrti. Epics and Puranas were also looked on as Smrti, and contain much legal lore. In fact hundreds of verses in Manu r also to be found in Mahābhārata, and were probably not plagiarized, but inherited from common source.  Many medieval jurists wrote lengthy commentaries on Smrti literature. Of these most important was Vijñāneśvara, who wrote at court of great Cālukya emperor, Vikramāditya VI (c. 1075–1127). His Mitāk arā, commentary on lawbook of Yājñavalkya, played very important part in forming civil law of modern India. Other important jurists of middle ages were Hemadri (c. 1300), and Jāmūtavāhana (12th century), whose treatise on inheritance ( Dāyabhāga), part of great compilation called Dharmaratna, has also influenced law of modern India.  It cannot be too strongly stressed that whole Smrti literature is work of brāhmans, who wrote from their own point of view. Arthaśāstra, written from more secular angle, differs from Smrtis in many particulars. It is certain that advice of Sm tis was not regularly followed in many ancient kingdoms, though it became increasingly authoritative with time. statements of Smrtis must as far as possible be checked by comparison with Arthaśāstra and by passing references to law and custom in general literature, inscriptions, and writings of foreign travellers.

THE BASIS OF LAW
Though we know very little about legal system of Ṛg Vedic period it is clear that idea of divine cosmic order already existed. ta, regularity of universal process, was perhaps forerunner of later concept of Dharma. latter word, etymologically akin to English word “form”, is untranslatable, and had many meanings. In Aśokan inscriptions and some other Buddhist sources it seems to hv broad general meaning of “righteousness”; but in legal literature it may perhaps be defined as divinely ordained norm of good conduct, varying acc to class and caste. In this context we translate it as “Sacred Law”.

As well as Dharma there are, acc to textbooks, other bases of law: contract, custom and royal ordinance. earlier religious lawbooks give little attention to these, but their importance increases with time. It was recognized that, owing to decadence of age, Dharma was not now known in its fullness and purity and [Page 114] therefore supplementary sources of law were needed. Generally Dharma was thought to override all other bases of law, but Arthaśāstra and one other lawbook43 maintain that royal ordinance overrides others, doctrine which we must ascribe to totalitarianism of Mauryas, and which few jurists would hv supported.

The king’s duty of protection was chiefly protection of Dharma, and as protector of Dharma he was Dharma incarnate. From Asoka onwards kings sometimes assumed title Dharmarāja, which was also one of names of Yama, god of death and departed. Both Yama and king maintained Sacred Law by punishing evil-doers and rewarding righteous.  Another concept, much in evidence in some sources, was that of Da a.  primary meaning of this word is “a stick”, from which its secondary meanings may be easily inferred. In varying contexts it may be translated as “military force”, “coercion”, “punishment”, “a fine”, or simply “justice”.  Human nature was evil and corrupt. In benighted age in which most ancient Indian writers on law and morals believed themselves to be living mankind could only be disciplined to observe Sacred Law by fear of punishment. In stern words of Manu: “If king did not inflict punishment untiringly on evil-doers stronger would roast weaker, like fish upon spit….  “The whole world is controlled by punishment, for guiltless man is hard to find….  “Where dark and red-eyed Punishment walks land, destroying sinners, people r not harassed, if he who inflicts it is discerning.” 44 king’s responsibility for maintaining Dharma by means of Danda was not taken lightly. Impartial administration of justice brought him same spiritual reward as Vedic sacrifices. Kings failing in their duty suffered in Hell. Even delay in justice was visited with dire penalties, for legendary king called Nrga was reborn as lizard, because he kept two litigants waiting in dispute over cow. Some sources declared that it was incumbent upon king to restore full value of stolen articles to plaintiff, if thief could not be brought to justice. Moreover, king was [Page 115] believed to incur demerit of criminals not brought to book, and to suffer in next life accordingly, while from secular point of view king who perverted justice or was negligent in its administration was in danger of losing his throne.


CRIME
Megasthenes speaks of Indians as remarkably law-abiding, and states that crime was very rare; similar evidence is given by Fa-hsien and by medieval Arab travellers, though Hsüan Tsang gives somewhat less favourable picture. impressions of foreign travellers r not wholly confirmed by Indian sources, however, and profound sense of insecurity of life and property underlies much of legal literature.  In earlier part of period with which we deal, process was going on in some ways comparable to that which is now taking place in parts of Africa. Uncivilized or semi-civilized tribes were breaking up under pressure of Āryan Culture; even as early as Mauryan times villages were often overpopulated; many poor folk from country and hills drifted to towns, as they r doing at present day, and found life even more difficult than in their old surroundings. Some of these unfortunate and uprooted people provided submerged tenth of habitual criminals which seems to hv existed in all ancient Indian cities. In order to suppress crime Arthaśāstra advises imposition of stringent curfew from about two and half hours after sunset to same time before dawn. Later sources speak of castes of professional thieves who had developed stealing to fine art, and who made use of written manuals on their profession.  Crime was equally rampant in countryside, where existence of large robber bands is attested from time of Buddha onwards. Hsüan Tsang gives earliest account of hereditary bandits who robbed their victims and murdered dm as religious duty, like later thugs. Trading caravans were heavily guarded, but were nevertheless frequently plundered by highwaymen. Thus ancient India was faced with very serious crime problem, though evidence of most of foreign travellers suggests that best ancient Indian kings managed to cope with it. Crime was suppressed through local officers and garrison commanders, who had large staffs of police and soldiers, as well as secret agents who served as detectives. Watchmen kept guard through night in city and village, and in some medieval kingdoms special officers ( duhsādhasādhanika) were deputed to track down and apprehend bandits.



ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
[Page 116]
In small kingdoms to which early Dharma Sūtras refer king might be sole source of justice and indeed his own executioner, striking down condemned thieves with his mace; but in general administration of justice was delegated, king’s court being reserved for appeals and serious crime against state. In medieval kingdoms, councillor called Prādvivaka, king’s chief legal adviser, seems to hv been responsible for justice and might also himself act as judge.

The composition of courts varied with time and place, but evidence indicates that ancient India preferred bench of magistrates to single judge. Jātaka story tells of bench of five magistrates, all of whom, incidentally, r corrupt, while Arthaśāstra advises that court with bench of three magistrates be set up for every ten villages, with higher courts in districts and provinces. Manu suggests bench consisting of Pradvivaka and three lesser judges, while drama called “The Little Clay Cart” (p. 441) contains scene in court of justice, presided over by chief judge, here called adhikara ika, wealthy merchant ( śre hin), and representative of caste of scribes ( kāyastha). title given to chief judge is derived from adhikarana, “a government office”, and suggests that he was an official who combined judicial and administrative functions; two other magistrates were evidently leading citizens, who served on bench as do our justices of peace.  Though judicial corruption is often referred to, standards set for judges and magistrates were very high; they were to be learned, religious, devoid of anger, and as impartial as humanly possible. To prevent bribery it is suggested that no private interviews should be allowed between judges and litigants until cases r settled. Arthaśāstra advises that honesty of judges should be periodically tested by agents provocateurs, while Vi u Smrti prescribes banishment and forfeiture of all property for judge found guilty of corruption or injustice—the most severe penalty brāhman
could incur under Sacred Law.

False witness was generally looked on with great abhorrence, and, besides various temporal penalties, incurred hundred unhappy rebirths in afterworld. In serious criminal cases evidence might be accepted from all sources, but in civil law only certain witnesses were qualified; generally women, learned brahmans, government servants, minors, debtors, persons with criminal records, and persons suffering from physical defects could not be called on to give evidence, while evidence of low-caste people was not valid against persons [Page 117] of higher caste. Several tests, some very sound psychologically, r laid down to assess veracity of witnesses.  Where accused was open to grave suspicion not amounting to certainty he might be tortured to elicit confession. tortures enumerated for this purpose r not all of most extreme type, and include various forms of whipping. Brahmans, children, aged, sick, lunatics and pregnant women were theoretically exempt from torture, while only light torture was prescribed for women.  Another means of ascertaining guilt was ordeal, which could be used in both civil and criminal cases, and in certain forms is still sometimes resorted to in India to settle disputes out of court. Ordeal is but little mentioned in early texts, but seems to hv grown more popular in later times. Smrti writers apparently distrusted ordeals, and generally limited their application to cases in which there was no concrete evidence on either side. Several ordeals r mentioned, however, including ordeals by fire and immersion similar to those known in medieval Europe, and possibly having common Indo-European origin in remote past. Specially interesting is ordeal of ploughshare, in which accused man had to touch red- hot iron ploughshare with his tongue; if it was not burned he was deemed innocent-psychologically fairly sound test of his own confidence in result, since if he had guilty conscience his salivary glands would not function properly, and his tongue would be burnt.  Megasthenes remarked that Indian was not inclined to litigation, and he may hv been correct, though same could not be said of India of more recent times. In any case, though there were many brāhmans learned in law they never constituted class of professional pleaders, and those who did not serve on bench presumably used their knowledge to settle cases out of court. There is evidence, however, that by end of our period class of lawyers, in modern sense, was beginning to develop, for some late textbooks allow litigants to employ proxies, who r to be rewarded with share of money involved, while one source grants to any learned brahman right to give his views on case from body of court. 45

PUNISHMENT
The penalties imposed for criminal offences developed from two very ancient customs, wergeld and religious penance imposed for ritual offences. influence of both cn be clearly traced in system of punishment followed in later times. [Page 118] early Sūtras laid down fines for punishment of murder 1,000 cows for killing ksatriya, 100 for vaiśya, and 10 for śūdra or woman of any class; killing of brāhman could not be expiated by fine. cattle were handed to king, who passed dm on to relatives of slain man, bull being added as king’s perquisite. Later sources lose sight of true nature of fines as means of buying off vengeance of family of dead man, and lay down that cattle r expiatory gifts, to be given to brāhmans. But wergeld left its mark on legal system in form of fines, which, with or without other punishment, r special feature of ancient Indian justice. Fines ranging from small copper coin to confiscation of all property were levied, and could atone for all but most serious crime. They were an appreciable source of income to state, and many medieval charters, giving revenue rights over village or district, specifically include right to receive fines levied at local court. condemned person who could not pay his fine was reduced to bondage until it was paid by his labour. Smrti writers rarely mention imprisonment, but all other sources show that it was common. Aśoka was proud of many gaol-deliveries which he had ordered in course ofhis reign; acc to later tradition he is said to hv maintained in his unreformed early years prison in which most fiendish tortures were inflicted, and from which no prisoner came out alive.46 Hsüan Tsang mentions imprisonment as usual form of punishment under Harsa. Forced labour in state mines and elsewhere is mentioned as punishment in ArthasJstra, and no doubt amounted to imprisonment of very severe type. Mutilation and torture were common penalties for many crimes, and numerous forms r described by legal writers. Such punishments were often looked on rather as penances, and idea of religious penance was never completely absent from thought of pious authors of Smrtis, in considering punishment of crime. It was generally believed that by undergoing punishment in this life criminal escaped evil consequences of his crime in next. death penalty is laid down in many forms and for many crimes. Unlike early Sūras Arthaśāstra prescribes it for murder, even as result of duel or quarrel, if injured man dies within seven days. Hanging is penalty for spreading false rumours, housebreaking, and stealing king’s elephants and horses. Those who plot against king, force entry into king’s harem, aid his enemies, create disaffection in army, murder father, mother, son, brother or an ascetic, or commit serious arson, r to be burnt alive. Beheading is penalty laid down by Arthaśāstra for [Page 119] wilful murder or stealing herd of cattle. man who deliberately breaks dam is to be drowned in same dam. Women murdering their husbands or children, killing others by poison, or committing arson r to be torn apart by oxen. Civilians stealing military supplies r to be shot to death with arrows. These r some of many forms of execution suggested by Arthaśāstra. This text is comparatively lenient towards sexual crime, but Manu also prescribes death in various unpleasant forms for most types of adultery and sexual assault. Even benevolent Asoka, for all his distaste for taking of life, did not abolish death penalty (p. 55). usual form of execution, little mentioned in textbooks on law, but often referred to in general literature, was impalement. Nevertheless it is evident that some opinion definitely opposed death penalty, and question is considered from both sides in remarkable passage in Mahābhārata. 47 Here argument against capital punishment and heavy penalties in general is not based, as might be expected, on doctrine of non-violence, which in no way forbade either capital punishment or war, but rests wholly on humanitarian considerations. In most cases mutilation, long imprisonment and execution result in untold suffering for many innocent people, especially for wife and family of criminal. argument is quickly refuted-in this dark age innocent must suffer with guilty, in order that society may be protected, anarchy avoided, and men enabled to pursue Sacred Law in peace.
Humanitarian ideas, probably encouraged by Buddhism, were effective in Gupta times in moderating fierce punishment of earlier days. Fa-hsien records that death penalty was not imposed in Northern India, but most crime punished by fines, and only serious revolt by amputation of one hand. Chinese traveller may hv exaggerated, but his testimony at least suggests that executions were rare. Hsüan Tsang 200 years later, reported that prisoners were not executed under Har a, but were left to rot in dungeons. In later times there is good evidence that capital punishment was inflicted, and criminals often became victims of human sacrifice, but in medieval period we read of sentences which, even by modern standards, seem surprisingly mild. Thus Cō inscription records gift of 96 sheep to endow perpetual lamp in temple, donor being man who had stabbed an army officer to death; this was apparently only penalty he suffered. Other South Indian instances cn be found of murderers being let off with comparatively small penances of this nature. It would seem that here blood feud had by no means disappeared, and if murderer could appease enmity of his victim’s family court would let him off lightly. [Page 120] Killing in self-defence was justified in law, as was stealing of small quantities of food to stave off starvation. In later times lives of many animals were protected by law, especially that of cow. story of Cō king who ordered execution of his own son for accidental killing of calf is certainly legend, and we need not believe that Kumārapāla (c. 1143–1172), Jaina king of Caulukya dynasty of Gujarāt, so strictly enforced non-violence that heavy
fines were inflicted on people who killed fleas, but these stories show climate of opinion in medieval India. wanton killing of cow, in later period, was among most serious of crimes. legal system envisaged by Smrtis would impose graduated punishment acc to class. Thus brāhman slandering ksatriya should, acc to Manu, pay fine of fifty panas, but for slandering vaiśya or śūdra fines r only twenty-five and twelve pa as respectively. For members of lower orders who slander their betters penalties r much more severe. Similar gradations of penalty acc to class of offender r laid down for many crimes, and equality of all before law was never admitted in ancient India, and was quite contrary to most Indian thought. If samatā, which Aśoka instructed his officials to employ in their judicial dealings,48 means equality case is unique; it is probable that word implies no more than consistency, or perhaps mildness. It is hardly likely that even Aśoka was bold enough to introduce so drastic change in administration of justice-one which no other ancient lawgiver, Indian or otherwise, would hv agreed to. In later Vedic period some brāhmans claimed to be above law altogether. At proclamation of king at end of royal consecration ceremony chief officiating brahman turned to assembled multitude and cried “Here is your king, 0 Kurus-for us, our king is [the god] Soma”. At all times priestly class claimed many privileges in law. acc to most orthodox sources brāhmans were exempt from execution, torture, and corporal punishment, worst penalty that could be imposed on dm being humiliation of losing their topknot (p. 160), followed by confiscation of property and banishment. But Sm ti of Kātyāyana allows execution of brāhman for procuring abortion, murder of respectable woman, and theft of gold, while Arthaśāstra admits it for sedition, and also sanctions branding of brahmans. In “The Little Clay Cart” hero, though brāhman, is threatened with torture and sentenced to death, and there is much other evidence that brāhmans did not always obtain privileges which they claimed.

[Page 121] In fairness to Hindu legal system, we must note that it did not always work in favour of brāhma . Manu lays down that as penalty for theft śūdra should pay fine equal to eight times value of stolen goods, while vaiśya, ksatriya and brāhman should pay sixteen, thirty-two, and sixty-four times value respectively. upper classes were expected to follow higher standards of conduct than lower, and their thefts were correspondingly more heinous.
As well as royal courts there were other tribunals which could arbitrate disputes and deal with minor crime. These were councils of villages, castes and guilds, whose validity as judicial bodies for their members was fully recognized in legal literature. They could punish offenders by fines and excommunication, latter very serious penalty indeed, and they probably played as important part in life of community as did king’s courts. Unfortunately we hv little knowledge of their procedure.


THE SECRET SERVICE
Perhaps least pleasant feature of political life in ancient India was espionage system. most detailed picture of working of this secret service is given in Arthaśāstra, author of which devotes two chapters to its organization, and refers to it throughout his treatise. text visualizes country riddled from top to bottom with secret agents or spies.  They were organized through “institutes of espionage” to which they delivered information, sometimes in cipher, and from which they received their orders. These institutes were not responsible for whole organization of espionage, however, for there were special spies, directly subordinate to king or high minister, and employed to spy on ministers themselves.  spies might be recruited from any walk of life, and might be of either sex. Brāhmans unable to make living by their learning, merchants fallen on evil days, barbers, astrologers, humble servitors, prostitutes, peasants-all might be enrolled as secret agents. special class of spy was satr, an orphan trained from childhood for work, and usually masquerading as holy-man or fortuneteller, two professions members of which were specially trusted by public and might gain access to information which others might find difficulty in obtaining. further class was that of desperado, recruited from professional prize-fighters, whose main duty was assassination of those enemies of king for whom public trial was not expedient, but who also performed other secret deeds of daring and violence on behalf of his master.  [Page 122] ancient Indian secret service has incurred much criticism, some of which is not wholly fair. Probably no government at any time has been able to function without secret agents of some sort, if only honest detectives for suppression of crime, and every ancient civilization had its spies, though perhaps not so thoroughly organized as in system of Arthaśāstra. ancient Indian spy system was not quite comparable to secret political police of some modern states, since its function was by no means confined to suppression of criticism and sedition, and it was looked on not as mere macchiavellian instrument for maintaining power, but as an integral part of state machinery.  Certainly one of spy’s chief duties was protecting king’s power.  He sought out sedition, whether in brothel or in palace of crown- prince. He served as agent provocateur, to test loyalty of high ministers, generals, and judges. In territory of enemies, whether potential or actual, he not only obtained information on strength and plans of enemy but encouraged sedition, and plotted assassination of enemy king and his ministers. He also acted as detective for suppression of crime. For this purpose he frequented taverns, brothels and gambling dens in disguise, listened to conversation of men in their cups, and carefully watched those who seemed abnormally affluent.  But he had also other duties of more positive character. He was an important means of keeping finger on pulse of public opinion. In the
story of Rama (p. 412f) it is spy who informs king that his subjects
suspect Sītā’s chastity. secret service, in fact, kept king in touch
with his people. It was also means of maintaining king’s popularity.

One of spy’s duties was to spread stories favourable to king, to praise him in public, and to argue with those who criticized administration. There is no reason to believe that mild criticism of king or his administration was normally punished. ancient Indian secret service might no doubt, in hands of an unjust king, be very evil thing, but under just administration it had positive and useful functions, and was not mere instrument of repression.

HINDU MILITARISM
The rule of law in personal, family and class relations was fundamental element of ancient Indian thought, but in sphere of international affairs there was no real conception of its possibility. few enlightened people recognized evil effects of warfare which afflicted Indian sub- continent during most of its history, but [Page 123] their message was generally unheard. Aśoka was possibly only ancient Indian king who finally broke with tradition of aggression, though his spirit cn perhaps be heard in certain passages in Buddhist texts, and many ordinary people must hv echoed his sentiments. Nevertheless, positive condemnations of war r rare in Indian literature. In one story Buddha himself is depicted as intervening in tribal war between Śakyas and their neighbours Koliyas, and persuading contestants to come to terms. In beautiful Dhammapada, an early collection of Buddhist verse, we read: Victory breeds hatred, for conquered sleep in sorrow; above victory or defeat calm man dwells in peace.49 Buddhism was specially popular with mercantile classes, who stood to lose much from constant warfare, and passing and rare references to evils of war in Buddhist texts may in part represent mild protest of vaiśyas against continual campaigning which interfered with their trading ventures. In any case war was generally accepted as normal activity of state, even by Buddhist kings. doctrine of non-violence, which in medieval India had become very influential, and had made most of respectable classes vegetarian, was never at this time taken to forbid war or capital punishment. It was only in modern times that Mahātmā Gāndhī reinterpreted it in this sense. intense militarism of ancient India did not lead to building of permanent empire over whole sub-continent. In this respect early history of India contrasts strikingly with that of China, where, from 3rd century B.C., single empire was rule, and division exception. In India Mauryas succeeded in creating unified empire for century, and in heyday of Guptas much of North India was under one hand, but with these exceptions numerous factors prevented unification of recognized cultural unit of Bhāratavar a, which so many ambitious monarchs desired. One of these factors was mere size of land, but Chinese emperors conquered equal difficulties. Another reason for failure of Indian empire builders was that, for all wise counsel of Arthasastra, no king of India was able to develop bureaucracy capable of functioning without strong guiding hand; in China examination system and ethics of Confucius ensured that those in charge of affairs would usually be men of character and intellect, [Page 124] if rather pedantic and conservative. But main factor which prevented unification of India was martial tradition itself.  For post-Mauryan king idea of empire was something very different from that to which West is accustomed. acc to Arthaśāstra there r three types of conquest: righteous conquest, conquest for greed, and demoniac conquest. * first is conquest in which defeated king is forced to render homage and tribute, after which he or member of his family is reinstated as vassal. second is victory in which enormous booty is demanded and large portions of enemy territory annexed. third involves political annihilation of conquered kingdom and its incorporation in that of victor. two latter types r generally disapproved of by all sources except Arthaśāstra. Thus Mahābhārata declares: “A king should not attempt to gain earth unrighteously, for who reveres king who wins unrighteous victory? Unrighteous conquest is impermanent, and does not lead to heaven.” 50 idea of “righteous conquest” or “conquest acc to Sacred Law” may hv developed among Āryans soon after their occupation of North India, as an expression of their solidarity against dark-skinned natives. It is evident, though not explicitly stated, in later Vedic literature. kings of Magadha, from Bimbisāra onwards, ignored it, and annexed territory without compunction; but doctrine that war should be waged for glory and homage rather than sordid aims such as wealth and power grew in importance with fall of Mauryas, and was accepted by medieval quasi-feudal order. “Demoniac conquest” still took place from time to time, notably under Guptas, but “righteous conquest” was ideal which Hindu kings were expected to follow, and it is evident that they usually did. War became sport of kingsa sport which was often very profitable and always very serious, in which shame of defeat might well only be expunged by suicide, but sport nevertheless. Peninsula, inheriting fierce Dravidian tradition never completely submerged by Āryan influence, had more realistic approach; here conquest with annexation was more common, as well as ruthlessness towards captives and non-combatants, but even South was not unaffected by ideal of “righteous conquest�.

PLATE XXX
[Page 125] In most of texts on statecraft we read of “six instruments of policy” ( ādgu ya): peace, war, waiting for enemy to strike first blow, attack, alliance, and “double policy” or making peace with one enemy and continuing war with another. * list is stock one, and gives further example of delight of Indian theorist in pedantic classification, but it is nevertheless significant. Peace is only one of six categories; others r aspects of war in all its branches. Arthaśāstra quotes an earlier authority, Vātavyādhi, as disagreeing with sixfold classification, and maintaining that statecraft involved only two aspects, peace and war.51 Of this view text strongly disapproves; pacific relations r straightforward and obvious, while war is complex and highly developed. It is significant that one of words commonly used for enemy, para, has simple primary meaning of “other”. At all times conquest was chief ambition of Indian king. Even Aśoka, who abjured aggressive war, did not give up hope of conquest (p. 54). position is succinctly put by Arthaśāstra: “The king who is weaker than ‘the other’ should keep peace; he who is stronger should make war.” 52 same aphorism is repeated in many other sources, in slightly varying forms, but difference of attitude is apparent as we leave Mauryan recollections of Arthaśāstra for later texts, outlook of which reflects memories of later Vedic age, adapted to often anarchic conditions of period between Mauryas and Guptas.  For earlier source war is “continuation of policy by other means”. Its purpose is not glory, but wealth and power, and passage we hv quoted, defining three types of conquest, is, we believe, either sop to conventional doctrine or later interpolation, for it is inconsistent with tenor of book. whole work is written for king who aspires to become an emperor on Mauryan model, and such king is not advised to embark on war lightly. There r many other ways of gaining power, intrigue and assassination among them, and these should always be resorted to in preference to war, which should only be looked on as last resort. If king suffers decisive defeat he must submit, in hope that he will be allowed to retain his throne as vassal and ultimately again achieve independence and conquer his former overlord. Arthaśāstra says nothing about fair play in battle, and evidently looks on conquest of demoniac variety as most profitable and advisable. Though in one passage, not in keeping with main tenor of work, it suggests allowing conquered king to remain as vassal, it ends on note [Page 126] of humanitarian imperialism. victor must do everything in his power to conciliate conquered people; if their economy has suffered badly from war, taxes must be remitted; ministers of defeated king must be won round, and law and order restored as quickly as possible; when in conquered country king should wear local dress and follow local customs. Evidently, from point of view of Arthaśāstra, main motive of war is gain and building up of great empire. more orthodox texts, however, take different point of view. Here major motive of war is glory, not gain. War is not merely means to an end, but part of warrior’s dharma, and good for its own sake. As soon as king has established himself on throne he should, as matter of course, attack his neighbours. Rules of fair fighting r laid down, which r not heard of in Arthaśāstra. For later sources, such as Manu, battle was ideally gigantic tournament with many rules: warrior fighting from chariot might not strike one on foot; an enemy in flight, wounded or asking quarter might not be slain; lives of enemy soldiers who had lost their weapons were to be respected; poisoned weapons were not to be used. Homage and not annexation was rightful fruit of victory. These rules were not always kept. heroes of Mahābhārata infringe dm many times, even at behest of their mentor Krsna, and infringements r explained and pardoned by recourse to casuistical arguments of expediency and necessity. rules of war could only be maintained strictly by king certain of victory or certain of defeat. Where chances were narrow claims of selfpreservation inevitably made themselves felt. But chivalrous rules of warfare, probably based on very old tradition, and codified in their present form among martial peoples of Western India in post-Mauryan times, must hv had some effect in mitigating harshness of war for combatant and non-combatant alike. It is doubtful if any other ancient civilization set such humane ideals of warfare. Together with these rules, later texts introduce conception of military honour, which is not found in realistic Arthaśāstra, except in form of propaganda to maintain morale of troops. Flight is deepest of shames; soldier slain in flight incurs guilt of his lord, and suffers proportionately in after-life, but soldier slain while fighting to last passes straight to heaven. Such ideals culminated in jauhar, final holocaust which was fate of many medieval Rājput king, with his family and bodyguard, women and children burning alive in inner chambers of fort while men fought to last on battlements. [Page 127] live dog was no longer thought to be better than dead lion, in so far as spirit of Epics permeated Hindu life. But Arthaśāstra was not wholly forgotten, and not every king of medieval India was willing to sacrifice himself and his family when defeat stared him in face. As well as kings who resisted Muslim invaders to last there were many who tried to buy dm off, and who retained diminished kingdoms under suzerainty of hated Mleccha. In this political climate it is not surprising that inter-state relations were of most macchiavellian character. basic concept which governed relations of one king with another was doctrine of “circles” ( ma ala), which, like many other concepts, was pedantically elaborated by theorists on statecraft. king on whose territory circle is centred is known as “he who desires conquest” ( vijig u). king whose territory adjoins that of would-be conqueror is “the enemy” ( ari)—“when he is in trouble he must be attacked, when he has little or no help he may be uprooted, otherwise he must be harassed and weakened”. 53 Beyond enemy lies “the friend” ( mitra) natural ally of conqueror. So far system of circles is simple and obvious, but theorists enlarged it further. Beyond friend is “the enemy’s friend” ( arimitra), and beyond him “the friend’s friend” ( mitramitra). opposite frontier of conqueror’s kingdom provides further series of potential foes and allies, “heelsiezer” ( pār graha), who is an ally of conqueror’s enemy and is liable to attack him in rear, “defender” or rearward friend ( ākranda), heelsiezer’s ally ( pār grāhisāra), and rearward friend’s friend ( ākrandāsāra). main purport of this enumeration is clear-a king’s neighbour is his natural enemy, while king beyond his neighbour is his natural ally. working of this principle cn be seen throughout history of Hindu India in temporary alliances of two kingdoms to accomplish encirclement and destruction of kingdoms between them. In such conditions diplomatic relations were not thoroughly organized, and there is no evidence of system of permanent ambassadors. Relations between one court and another were maintained by envoys ( dūta), who resided at court to which they were sent only while transacting business in hand. As in most civilizations, person of envoy was
inviolable, and king slaying an envoy was thought to be reborn in hell
with all his councillors.

Megasthenes states that peasants would till their fields peacefully, even when battle was raging nearby, but this is probably too optimistic generalization. Devastation of crops to weaken [Page 128] enemy was quite legitimate acc to textbooks, and, although there was strong feeling that lives of non-combatants should be respected, this rule was not always kept. In any case, except in favoured times and localities peasant could never feel wholly safe from raiders, and, though wholesale sacking of cities was not common in ancient India, townsman could rarely feel altogether secure against looting and exactions of enemy occupation. Conditions in Hindu India were not unlike those in medieval Europe, where there was broad and recognized cultural unity accompanied by inter-state anarchy resulting in perpetual warfare. In Europe, however, well-organized. and centralized Roman Church often acted as pacifying element in situation; in India Hinduism, which had no all-embracing super-national organization, rather encouraged inter-state anarchy by incorporating many martial traditions into Sacred Law.

MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND TECHNIQUE ancient Indian army contained more than one type of soldier, and troops r sometimes classified into six categories: hereditary troops, forming backbone of army; mercenaries; troops provided by corporations ( śreni); troops supplied by subordinate allies; deserters from enemy; and wild tribesmen, used for guerilla fighting in hill and jungle. Of this list third category is obscure, but it perhaps refers to private armies, maintained by merchant guilds for protection of their caravans and trading posts, which might be loaned to king. In medieval Ceylon corporation of Malabar merchants called Ma igrāma (p. 223), like Honourable Company in 18th century India, became an important and often decisive factor in island’s politics through its private army. fierce mercenaries of Kerala (Malabār) and Karnāta (Mysore) found ready employment in armies of many Indian and Sinhalese kings throughout Middle Ages. Of four great classes ksatriya was warrior par excellence, and no doubt most of hereditary troops considered themselves to belong to this class, but all classes took part in war. Brāhmans holding high military rank r mentioned in Epics and in many medieval inscriptions, and their participation in war is expressly permitted in some texts. lower orders fought also, usually as auxiliaries or subordinates, but late textbook on polity ascribed to Śukra lays down that highest military posts, even to that of general, may be filled by śūdras or outcastes.54 In early Vedic period all free men were no doubt liable to [Page 129] military service by tribal custom, but, with strengthening of caste ideas, liability vanished in most parts of India. There is no evidence of general conscription in any major Indian kingdom from Mauryas onwards, though Arthaśāstra mentions villages which provided troops in lieu of taxes, and such villages of warriors existed in quasi-feudal Middle Ages; martial character of tribes of N.-W. India, Rājasthān, and parts of Western Deccan, seems to hv altered little from earliest times, despite numerous invasions and changes of overlord, and survives to present day; among such people most able-bodied men took part in war. traditional divisions of Indian army were four: elephants, cavalry, chariots, and infantry; some sources add other categories, such as navy, spies, pioneers, and commissariat, to bring total up to six or eīght. Of these elements most important, from point of view of contemporary theory, was first. Elephants trained for war r first mentioned in Buddhist scriptures, where it is said that king Bimbisara of Magadha owned large and efficient elephant corps. They were trained with great care and attention, and, marching in van of army, acted rather like tanks in modern warfare, breaking up enemy’s ranks and smashing palisades, gates, and other defences (p. 457f); line of elephants might also act as living bridge for crossing shallow rivers and streams. Elephants were often protected by leather armour, and their tusks tipped with metal spikes. Chinese traveller Sung Yiin, who visited kingdom of Hū as in early 6th century, speaks of fighting elephants with swords fastened to their trunks, with which they wrought great carnage, but there is no confirmation of this practice in other sources. As well as mahout elephant usually carried two or three soldiers, armed with bows, javelins and long spears, and advanced with small detachment of infantry to defend it from attack. great reliance placed on elephants by Indian tacticians was, from practical point of view, unfortunate. Though fighting elephants might at first strike great terror in an invading army unused to them, they were by no means invincible. Just as Romans found means of defeating elephants of Pyrrhus and Hannibal, so Greeks, Turks, and other invaders soon lost their fear of Indian fighting elephant. Even best trained elephant was demoralized comparatively easily, especially by fire, and when overcome by panic would infect its fellows, until whole squadron of elephants, trumpeting in terror, would turn from battle, throw riders, and trample troops of its own side. pathetic Indian faith in elephants’ fighting qualities was inherited by Muslim conquerors, who, after [Page 130] few generations in India, became almost as reliant on elephants as Hindus, and suffered at hands of armies without elephants in just same way. Cavalry, though important, was not up to standard of that of many other early peoples, and weakness of their cavalry was an important factor in defeat of Indian armies attacked by invaders from North- West; decisive victory of Alexander over Porus in 326 B.C. and that of Muhammad of Ghor over Prthvīrāja in A.D. 1192 were both largely due to superior, more mobile, cavalry. Mounted archers were special danger to Indian armies. chariot as vehicle of war disappeared soon after commencement of Christian era. In Vedic period it was major fighting arm, and it retained this importance in Epic stories. Arthaśāstra and other evidence shows that in Mauryan times it was still widely used in war, and early sculpture depicts few fighting chariots; but by Gupta times chariot was little more than means of transport. light two-horsed chariot of Vedic period, carrying only driver and warrior, developed into larger and more cumbrous vehicle. Four-horsed chariots r mentioned by classical sources, and r depicted at Sānchī and elsewhere, with horses yoked abreast, and carrying four men. Fig. x.—Royal Warriors (after terracotta plaque from Ahicchatrā, U.P. c. 6th century A.D.) There r several references to ships being used for military purposes, but little evidence that Indian kings had real conception of value of sea-power, or naval warfare. Ships were chiefly used for conveying troops, usually along great Indian rivers; but [Page 131] Cālukya king Pulakeśin II employed navy to besiege Purī, not far from modern Bombay (p. 511, n), and two great Cō kings, Rājarāja I and Rājendra I (p. 75), developed positive maritime policy and evidently had regular navy. Sinhalese conqueror Parākramabāhu I (p. 75) is said to hv invaded Burma by sea. Ships of war were used to put down many pirates who infested Indian Ocean, and Arab writers of Middle Ages show that petty chiefs of West Coast themselves organized pirate fleets; but, with exception of Cō as, it is doubtful if any Indian king possessed navy in modern sense. infantry, though little mentioned in texts, must at all times hv been real backbone of army. An élite corps, sort of Pretorian Guard, existed in most kingdoms. In medieval South this royal guard was pledged to defend king’s person to death, and its loyalty was confirmed by ceremonial meal eaten with king on his accession. privilege of eating with king conferred on guardsmen sort of nobility, and they r mentioned by Marco Polo as “Companions of Honour”. Arthaśāstra envisages corps of physicians to care for wounded, ready in rear with drugs, bandages, and other equipment. existence of such corps, and of staff of horse and elephant doctors attached to army, is confirmed by other sources. same text mentions employment of women to cook for troops in rear of battle. acc to most theorists basic unit of Indian army was patti, sort of mixed platoon consisting of one elephant, one chariot, three horses, and five foot-soldiers. Three of these constituted senāmukha, three senamukhas gulma, and so on up to “complete army” ( ak auhiznī), of 21,870 pattis. exaggerated precision of this list is another example of pedantry which beset most ancient Indian writing on practical matters, and there is no good evidence that army was regularly divided in this way, with all arms intermixed. Other sources speak of commands rising in units of ten, and Arthaśāstra mentions unit consisting of 45 chariots, 45 elephants, 225 horses, and 675 footmen; five of these detachments formed full battle array ( samavyūha), resembling Roman legion in size. Arthaśāstra allows wide variation in these numbers acc to availability of resources and requirements of situation. Indian army was usually very large one. Classical accounts state that forces of last Nanda king consisted of 20,000 cavalry, 2,000 chariots, 200,000 footmen, and number of elephants variously given as 3,000, 4,000, or 6,000. Plutarch records that [Page 132] Candragupta Maurya overran India with 600,000 men. Hsüan Tsang states that Harsa had 5,000 elephants, 20,000 cavalry, and 50,000 footmen at beginning of his career, which were increased to 60,000 elephants and 100,000 cavalry at height of his power. 9th-century Arab traveller Al Mas’ūdī says that Pratihara king Mahendrapala had four armies of 800,000 men each, while Cō king Rajaraja I is said to hv invaded kingdom of Calukyas with an army of 900,000. All this evidence is far from reliable, but it is noteworthy that estimates of size of medieval armies r considerably larger than those of armies of earlier period, and this may bear some relation to fact. Fully mobilized, and including auxiliaries and non-combatants, it is not impossible that total fighting force of larger medieval kingdom numbered well over million. acc to Megasthenes Mauryan army was organized under committee of thirty, divided into sub-committees which controlled corps of infantry, cavalry, chariots, elephants, navy, and commissariat. This system seems to be modelled on Megasthenes’ description of city government of Pātaliputra (p. 103), and is not confirmed by any other source. Arthaśāstra describes army as organized under number of superintendents, with general ( senāpati) at head of all military affairs. Medieval armies often had numerous generals, with “great general” ( mahāsenāpati) in supreme command. general was always very important figure in realm, and often member of royal family. He took orders direct from king, who was expected to take command in major engagements, even when aged. Kings often fought in van of battle, but cautious Arthaśāstra advises dm to direct operations from rear. Below general were numerous captains ( nāyaka, da anāyaka), who, in medieval period, often approximated to feudal nobility. Regiments, divisions, and squadrons were recognized by distinguishing standards, and often had definite corporate life. In medieval South India we hear of troops of regiment subscribing to fund for dependants of comrade killed in battle, and there r records of religious donations made by regimental subscription. arms of ancient India were not appreciably different from those of other early civilizations. Efforts hv been made by some scholars, not all of dm Indian, to show that firearms and even flying machines were known, but this is certainly not case. one clear reference to firearms occurs in Śukra, which is late medieval, and passage in question is probably an interpolation of Mughal times. mysterious and magical weapons of Epics, slaying hundreds at blow and dealing fire and death all around them, must be products of poet’s imagination. If India had had firearms her Greek, Chinese and Arab visitors would certainly hv recorded existence of such wonders, and also, fortiori, of marvellous aerial pavilions described in Rāmāyana, early Tamil texts, and elsewhere, making of which was quite beyond technical ability of any ancient civilization.

Gandhāra School PLATE XXXII [Page 133] In fact Indians possessed ancient world’s equipment of artillery-ballistas (not known before Mauryan times), battering rams and other siege engines. inspiration for wonderful weapons of poets may hv come from incendiary missiles, fireballs, fire-arrows and like, which were special feature of Indian military equipment, though disapproved of as unfair by Smrti writers. Arthaśāstra especially stresses value of incendiarism in war, and even suggests use of birds and monkeys to carry fire to enemy’s rooftops. It gives brief formulae for composition of inflammable material, which r clear enough to show that this was not gunpowder. usual Indian bow in Mauryan times was some five or six feet long, and often made of bamboo; it shot long cane arrows. acc to classical accounts it was very powerful instrument, which was rested on ground and steadied with one foot, but bows of few archers shown in early sculpture r raised from ground. Poisoned arrows were known and used, though condemned in religious texts. less cumbersome composite bow, often made of horn ( śar iga), was also known, and became more popular in later times. Swords were of various types, most dangerous being ni rimśa, long two-handed slashing sword. Lances and javelins were among usual equipment of Indian soldier, including special long lance ( tomara) used in fighting from backs of elephants. Iron maces and battle-axes were also used. Terracotta slingstones hv been found in remains of Indus cities, and sling was used in later times, though it does not seem to hv been an important weapon. warriors depicted in early sculpture (pl. XXIV) r only lightly defended with armour, but use of armour of metal or leather developed as result of influx of invaders from NorthWest, and in Middle Ages coats of mail became more usual, together with armour for horses and elephants. Shields of bent cane covered with leather, or of metal, were regularly used, sometimes protecting whole body. Helmets r not often depicted until Middle Ages, and it would seem that Indian soldier relied mainly on thick folds of his turban to protect his head.  [Page 134] Fortification was an important branch of military science, but nearly all fortresses of pre-Muslim India hv been so developed and adapted in later times that they no longer give true picture of ancient Indian military architecture. An important exception is long wall of rough-hewn stone protecting site of ancient Rajagrha, capital of Bimbisara of Magadha, which probably dates back to Buddha’s day.  Another example is Śiśupālgarh in Orissā, where small section of city wall dating from pre-Gupta times, has recently been excavated. It was []()workmanlike brick wall, set on an earthwork and probably surrounded by moat.

The ideal durga, or fortified city, as described in Arthaśāstra, was circled by three very wide moats, within which was an earthwork, covered with spiny shrubs, and surmounted by wall thirty-six feet high, with numerous square towers and roofed balconies for archers. With this may be compared Megasthenes’ description of defences of Pataliputra, which is said to hv had mighty wooden wall, with 570 towers and 64 gates. Arthaśāstra advises against use of wood for fortifications, owing to its liability to fire and rot, but archæology bears out Megasthenes, for remains of some of gigantic timbers of wall of Mauryan Pataliputra hv been excavated near modern Patna. defences of Śiśupalgarh were certainly smaller and less elaborate (pl. XIa).  Fig. xi.—A Siege (from relief at Sānchī, c. beginning of Christian era) most important surviving pre-Muslim fortress is Devagiri (modern Daulātābad), capital of Yādava kings of Northern Deccan until its capture by troops of Ala’-ud-din Khaljī in 1312. outer fortifications hv mostly been replaced and developed by later Muslim rulers, but citadel, on an almost inaccessible hill, (pl. IIc), still contains corridors cut by Hindu kings through solid rock, which were virtually only means of reaching summit, and r memorial to engineering skill of medieval India.  In sieges attackers relied mainly on close investment and reduction of their enemy by starvation and thirst, but capture by [Page 135] storm was not unheard of, and mining was regularly employed. word []()for mine or underground tunnel was sura ga, borrowed from Greek  word, which had same secondary meaning; from this we may infer that Indians learned something of siegecraft from Greco-Bactrian kings.  Indian army was slow and ponderous. Arthaśāstra declares that []()a good army cn march two yojanas day, while bad army only march one. yojana, like medieval English league, is an uncertain measure []()of distance, varying from four to ten miles; but internal evidence shows that author of Arthaśāstra had in mind yojana of about five miles. Thus march of ten miles per day was most that could be expected even of well-organized and efficient army. This is not surprising, when we read of its complex and cumbrous organization.  []()The army dwelt in an enormous camp which was, in fact, temporary kcity, with royal quarters, quarters for king’s harem, and for camp followers, merchants and prostitutes. king and his chief officers took many members of their families with dm on campaign, including representative selection of their wives and concubines, and probably lower ranks did likewise. Rā rakuita king Amoghavarsa I (817–877) was actually born in camp, while his father Govinda III was campaigning in Vindhyas. This large body of non-combatants not wholly subject to army discipline must hv appreciably slowed pace of army and impaired its efficiency. One theorist disapproved of women in camp,55 but it seems that his advice was rarely if ever followed.  Arthaśāstra envisaged strict discipline in camp; it was to be thoroughly guarded and policed, and exit and entry were to be controlled by rigorous system of passes. In fact it was probably less well organized than []()this source suggests, especially in later times, when secret of detailed organization, which Mauryas possessed and Arthaśāstra reflects, was largely lost. Bāna’s vivid description of Harsa’s army striking camp (p. k 448f) does not suggest very efficient quartermaster’s department.  []()The Arthaśāstra gives much advice on preliminaries of battle, but unfortunately says little on actual conduct of fighting, for which we must turn to exaggerated accounts of Epics and other sources.  Battle was great religious rite, highest sacrifice of warrior, and as such was not entered without proper preliminaries. day and time of giving battle were chosen with great care by astrologers, whenever this was possible, and purificatory rites were performed on its eve. Before battle  troops were harangued by brahmans, and [Page 136] by king himself, and were encouraged with promises of booty and glory, with certainty of heaven for slain.  Arthaśāstra advises employment of heavy infantry in centre, with light infantry, chariots, and cavalry on wings. elephants were generally concentrated in centre, while archers took up positions behind spearmen. Descriptions of battles r usually turgid, and overlaid with fanciful and supernatural elements; but it is clear that at most times great emphasis was placed on single combat between picked warriors.  Though mass fighting of rank and file must often hv played decisive part in encounter, it is given little notice in literary sources on which we must depend. For ordinary soldier courage and morale depended on leader. Only noble or elite warrior could be relied kon to fight to last, and there is more than one account of an army fleeing []()in panic when its chief was killed or wounded.  k[]()[]()The Arthaśāstra suggests that price should be put on every enemy head, varying acc to rank from twenty pa as upwards; this would not encourage giving of quarter, but massacre of prisoners was unusual, and it was very strongly deprecated in Smrti texts. Captives were usually released on payment of ransom, and those who could not pay, and these probably included most of common soldiers, were enslaved; but their enslavement was usually temporary, and they were released when they had paid their ransom by their labour.  From these notes it will be seen that inter-state relations and war were weakest aspects of Indian polity. kingdoms of medieval Hindu India, incapable either of empire building or of firm alliances, and maintaining enormous unwieldy armies which were continuously at war, indeed produced their heroes, but they were quite incapable of withstanding Turks, whose military science was not overburdened by pedantic theory or ancient tradition.

SOCIETY: CLASS, FAMILY AND INDIVIDUAL


LAWS OF CLASS AND STAGE OF LIFE
[Page 137]

OFTEN and in many contexts we read of “the Dharma of class and stage of life” ( varnasrama-dharma), which, in golden age of remote past, was self-evident and uninfringed, but which is now vague, misunderstood and partly forgotten, and which brahmans interpret and king preserves and enforces. implication of this phrase is that Dharma is not same for all. There is indeed common Dharma, general norm of conduct which all must follow equally, but there is also dharma appropriate to each class and to each stage in life of individual. kdharma of men of high birth is not that of humbler folk, and dharma of student is not that of old man.  This thoroughgoing recognition that men r not same, and that there is hierarchy of classes, each with its separate duties and distinctive way of life, is one of most striking features of ancient Indian sociology.  []()Criticisms of pretensions of higher classes were heard from time to time, and equalitarian propositions were occasionally put forward, but in general this concept has held its ground from end of Ṛg Vedic period to present day.


THE FOUR GREAT CLASSES

We hv seen that by end of Ṛg Vedic period fourfold division of society was regarded as fundamental, primeval, and divinely ordained (p.  35). four varnas of India developed out of very early Āryan class divisions, for some class stratification existed in many Indo-European communities, and ancient Iran had four pištras or classes, comparable in some respects to those of India. In India class stratification grew more rigid when, in Vedic period, situation arose rather like that prevailing in South Africa today, with dominant fair minority striving to maintain its purity and its supremacy over darker majority. Tribal class-divisions []()hardened, and dark-skinned aboriginal found place only in basement of Āryan social structure, as serf with few rights and many disabilities. Soon idea of varna had become so deeply embedded in [Page 138] Indian mind that its terminology was even used for []()classification of precious commodities such as pearls, and useful materials like timber. Theoretically all Aryans belonged to one of four classes, with exception of children, ascetics and widows, who were outside system.  Varna came to Dravidian South comparatively late, for earliest Tamil literature shows society divided into tribal groups with little sense of precedence of one over other. Succeeding centuries saw gradual hardening of class, until South Indian brahmans became even stricter in their ritual observances and untouchables even more debased than in North.  sharp distinction was made between three higher classes and śūdra. former were twice-born (dvija), once at their natural birth and again at their initiation, when they were invested with sacred thread and received into Āryan society1 (p. 161f). śūdra had no initiation, and was often not looked on as Āryan at all. fourfold division was in theory functional. Manu1 lays down that duty of brāhman is to study and teach, to sacrifice, and to give and receive gifts; ksatriya must protect people, sacrifice, and study; vaisya also sacrifices and studies, but khis chief function is to breed cattle, to till earth, to pursue trade and to lend money; sudra’s duty is only to serve three higher classes-and “it is better”, Manu adds elsewhere, 2 “to do one’s own duty badly than  another’s well”. This epigram, elaborated so beautifully in Bhagavad Gita, was leading theme of most Indian social thought; for each man there was place in society and function to fulfil, with its own duties and rights.

This was ideal, but though in Middle Ages it was perhaps approached, it has never been wholly reached. precepts of texts which lay down laws for conduct of four classes were rarely fully carried out in practice, and were often blatantly infringed. texts, which we hv already discussed (p. 1 l2f), were written by brāhmans and from brāhmanic point of view, and represent conditions as brāhmans would hv liked dm to be. Thus it is not surprising that they claim utmost honour for priestly class and exalt it above measure.

The brāhman was great divinity in human form. 3 His spiritual power was such that he could instantly destroy king and his army, if they attempted to infringe his rights. In law he claimed great privileges (p. 120), and in every respect he demanded precedence, honour and worship. Even Buddhist scriptures, though they do [Page 139] not admit more extravagant brahmanical claims and regularly exalt kṣatriya over brahma0., recognize his greatness, if he is pious and sincere.

These Buddhist sources show us two types of brāhman. There were learned brahmans, performing all rites of Āryan and receiving great respect; but there were also village brahmans, who made much of their living by fortune-telling and sorcery, and who were less honoured. For all rigidity of class system brahmans soon lost their racial purity, and it has even been suggested that, as Āryan culture expanded, schools of aboriginal sorcerers and medicine men managed to obtain footing in brahmanic order, just as aboriginal chiefs were certainly assimilated to warrior class. Thus, it may well be, proto-Hinduism of Harappā culture was ultimately assimilated to Āryan faith.

Of professional priests there were various types and classes-in earliest times we read of semi-legendary ṛṣ is, or seers, who composed Vedic hymns, while sacrificial ritual demanded number of priests (ṛ tvij) with specialized duties-invokers ( hotr), cantors ( udgdtr), and priests to perform manual operations of ceremony ( adhvaryu). term brāhmaṇ meant originally “one possessed of brahman”, mysterious magical force of type widely known to modern anthropologists by Polynesian word mana. It was first applied to specially trained priest who superintended whole sacrifice, and was ready to counteract with his magic spells any evil influence caused by minor errors of ritual. By end of R.g Vedic period term was used for all members of priestly class.

There were other divisions within order. brāhmans of later Vedic period were divided into exogamous septs ( gotra), system which was copied in part by other classes and has survived to present day (p. 153ff). Later brahman class formed many castes, linked together by endogamy and common practices. further division was śākhā or branch, based on recension of Vedic texts accepted as authoritative by family in question.

Often brahman lived under patronage of king or chief, and was provided for by grants of tax-free land, farmed by peasants, who would pay their taxes to brahman instead of to king; but there were also land- owning brahmans, who cultivated large estates by hired labour or serfs. religious brahman might hv high post at court, and purohita’s2 importance in state has [Page 140] already been noted (p. 100). Other brāhmans might earn competence as teachers of Veda, and of other branches of learning.

At all times many brāhmans led truly religious lives. Kalidasa’s Sakuntala gives charming picture of settlement of such pious brahmans, living simply but not too austerely in huts in forest, where even wild deer were unafraid of gentle hermits, and woodland was forever perfumed with fragrance of their sacred fires. Such brahman colonies were supported by gifts of kings and chiefs and of peasants of neighbourhood. Other brāhmans became solitary ascetics, while in Middle Ages brahman monastic orders were founded, rather on Buddhist model.

But varied religious activity of ancient India did not provide livelihood for more than few of brahmans. Smrti literature contains special sections on “duty when in distress” (apad-dharma), which carefully define what man may legitimately do when he cannot earn living by profession normally followed by his class, and by these provisions brāhmans might pursue all manner of trades and professions.

Many were employed in important government posts, and several royal families were of brāhman. origin. Generally lawbooks disapprove of brāhmans engaging in agriculture, because it inflicts injury on animals and insects, but this rule was often ignored. brahman is forbidden to trade in certain commodities-among dm cattle and other animals, slaves, weapons, and spirituous liquor-and his lending money at interest is also disapproved of, though Manu4 allows him to lend at low interest to “wicked people”, by whom he probably means those who do not maintain Āryan rites. But though he kept these rules rigidly, brahman would find many trades and professions open to him.

Opinions differed as to whether brahman engaged in secular profession was worthy of respect accorded to practising member of his class, and no clear ruling is laid down. Manu, most authoritative of Smrtis, is uncertain on this point, and in different parts of text diametrically opposed views r given. 5 As far as cn be gathered from general literature special rights of brahman were usually only granted to those who lived by sacrifice and teaching. Carudatta, poor brahman hero of play “The Little Clay Cart” (p. 120), receives scurvy treatment at hands of court, probably because he is brahman by birth only, and not by profession.

For all his prestige, brahman was often butt of satire. Even in Ṛ g Veda 6 croaking of frogs at beginning of rainy season is compared to monotonous reciting of priests, though here no sarcasm may be intended. But there cn be no other [Page 141] explanation of remarkable passage in early Chāndogya Upanisad, 7 which describes vision of sage Vaka Dālbhya, wherein dogs move round in circle, each holding tail of preceding dog in its mouth, “just as priests do when about to sing praises”; and then, repeating very sacred syllable Ōm, they sing:” Ōm! let us eat! Om! let us drink! Om! may gods Varuna, Prajapati and Savitr bring us food!” Another early reference to gluttony of brāhmaṇs occurs in Aitareya brāhmaṇ a, 8 in an interesting passage which describes other three classes from point of view of warrior; here brāhmaṇ is “a receiver of gifts, drinker of soma, an eater of food, to be expelled at will”. vidūṣ aka, fool of Sanskrit drama (p.

90), an amiable but gluttonous figure of fun, is invariably brāhmaṇ.

There are, however, few frontal attacks on brāhmaṇical pretensions, even
in literature of Buddhists, who came nearest to an anti-brāhmaṇical
point of view; but one brief Buddhist tract, “Diamond Needle”
( Vajrasūci), ascribed to Aśvaghoṣa, of 1st or 2nd century A.D., attacks
the claims of priesthood, and indirectly whole class system, with
vigorous dialectical skill. claims of brāhmaṇ were, in fact, often
ignored, and not wholly unchallenged.

The second class was ruling one, members of which were in the
Vedic period called rājanya, and later kṣ atriya. theoretical duty of the
ksatriya was “protection”, which included fighting in war and governing in
peace (p. 88f). In early times he often claimed precedence over the
brāhmaṇ; this claim is implicit in Aitareya brāhmaṇ passage which we
have quoted, inclusion of which in brāhmaṇ ical scripture is hard to
account for. acc to Buddhist tradition, in times when brāhmaṇs
are highest class Buddhas r born in that class, while when ksatriyas
are highest they r born as ksatriyas. historical Buddha was a
ksatriya, and his followers evidently had few doubts about class priorities.

Where names of four classes r mentioned together in Pali
scriptures that of ksatriya usually comes first.

A strong king was always check on brāhmaṇic pretensions, just as the
brāhmaṇs were check on pretensions of king. Tradition speaks of
many anti-brāhmaṇical kings who came to evil ends, and legend of
Parasurama, who destroyed whole ksatriya class for its impiety (p. 303),
must contain recollection of fierce strife between two classes in pre-
Buddhist times. After Mauryan period brāhmaṇ’s theoretical
position was established throughout most of India, but ksatriya was in
fact still often his equal or superior.

[Page 142] martial class of ancient India, from great emperors to
petty chiefs, was recruited from all races and ranks, and all invaders of
India down to coming of Muslims were given place in social
order in this way. Manu9 describes warlike peoples on fringes of
Āryan civilization, including Greeks ( Tavana), Scyths ( Saka), and
the Parthians ( Pahlava), as ksatriyas who had fallen from grace through
their neglect of Sacred Law, but who could be received once more into
the Āryan fold by adopting orthodox way of life and performing
appropriate penitential sacrifices. This provision might be applied to almost
any conquering people, and Rajputs, in later times ksatriyas par
excellence, were no doubt largely descended from such invaders.

The ksatriyas claimed and received certain privileges. They continued
old customs not in keeping with orthodoxy, with such persistence that the
brāhmaṇic lawgivers were forced to give dm legal status. Thus marriage
by capture was permitted to ksatriya, as were clandestine liaison and
the svayaṃ vara, at which girl chose her husband from among the
assembled suitors (p. 169). Like brāhmaṇs, they did not always live by
fulfilling their ideal function. rules of āpad-dharma applied to them
also, and there r many records of men of warrior stock becoming
merchants and craftsmen.

In Vedic times vaiśya, or mercantile class, though entitled to the
services of priesthood and to sacred thread of initiation, was but a
poor third to brāhmaṇs and kṣatriyas. In Aitareya brāhmaṇ a
passage to which we hv referred vaiśya is described as “paying tribute
to another, to be lived on by another, to be oppressed at will”. Other
passages in early brāhmaṇic literature show him as wretched and down-
trodden cultivator or petty merchant, who is of no interest to his betters
except as source of profit.

According to Manu10 special duty of vaiśya was keeping cattle,
which were made over to his charge at creation of world. class
evidently originated in ordinary peasant tribesman of R.g Veda, but
long before lawbook ascribed to Manu was composed it had many other
activities. śūdras, humblest of four classes, had by now taken to
agriculture, and Manu admits many other legitimate vaiśya occupations
besides cattle rearing and farming. ideal vaiśya has expert knowledge
of jewels, metals, cloth, threads, spices, perfumes, and all manner of
merchandise-he is, in fact, ancient Indian business-man.

Though brāhmaṇa literature gives vaiśya few rights and humble
status, Buddhist and Jaina scriptures, few centuries later in date and of
more easterly provenance, show that he was not always [Page 143]
oppressed in practice. They mention many wealthy merchants living in
great luxury, and powerfully organized in guilds. Here ideal vaiśya is
not humble taxpaying cattle-breeder, but asītikotivibhava, man
possessing eight million panas. Wealthy vaiśyas were respected by kings
and enjoyed their favour and confidence. It was they, rather than the
ksatriyas, who chiefly favoured rising unorthodox religions of
Buddhism and Jainism. They formed by this time, at least in regions of
Magadha and Kosala, true bourgeoisie, no doubt small in number, but
very important. Numerous inscriptions from Sunga times onwards record
the great donations of vaiśya merchants and skilled craftsmen to religious
causes, especially to Buddhism, and show that they were prosperous and
influential.

If vaiśya, acc to Aitareya Brdhmana, was to be oppressed at
will, lot of śūdra was even more unfortunate. He was “the servant of
another, to be expelled at will, to be slain at will” -but latter phrase may
be interpreted “to be beaten at will”, and import of whole passage
seems to be satirical.

śūdras were not “twice-born”. For dm there was no initiation into full
Āryan status, and they were not regularly considered Āryans, though the
Arthaśāstra in its chapters on slavery11 specifically mentions dm as such.

The śūdra was in fact second-class citizen, on fringes of Āryan
society. word śūdra is of doubtful etymology, and occurs only once in
the Ṛ g Veda; it was perhaps originally name of non-Āryan tribe, which
became subordinate to conquerors, and origin of śūdra class may
be accounted for in this way, though it certainly included other elements. As
the rigidity of brāhmaṇic observances increased, groups which refused to
accept orthodox custom, or clung to old practices which were no longer
respectable, fell to rank of śūdras. There r today castes which
themselves claim to be ksatriyas, but which r branded by brāhmaṇs as
śūdras because they adhere to customs which hv long become
objectionable, such as meat eating or remarriage of widows. Persons
born illegitimately, even when of pure high-class blood, were officially
counted as śūdras. 12
śūdras were of two kinds, “pure” or “not-excluded” ( aniravasita) and
“excluded” ( niravasita). latter were quite outside pale of Hindu
society, and were virtually indistinguishable from great body of people
later known as untouchables. distinction was made on basis of the
customs of śūdra group in question, and profession followed by its
members. acc to brāhmaṇical textbooks chief duty of the
pure śūdra was to wait on other three classes. He was to eat the
remnants of his [Page 144] master’s food, wear his cast-off clothing, and
use his old furniture. Even when he had opportunity of becoming
wealthy he might not do so, “for śūdra who makes money is distressing to
the brāhmaṇs”.13 He had few rights, and little value was set on his life in
law. brāhmaṇ killing śūdra performed same penance as for killing a
cat or dog. 14 śūdra was not allowed to hear or repeat Vedas. land
where śūdras were numerous would suffer great misery.

Thus textbooks give small hope of happiness to wretched śūdra,
who could do little but serve his betters in unpleasant and servile tasks, and
whose only hope was rebirth in higher social class; but there is good
evidence that śūdras did not always live humble and wretched life laid
down for dm in Sacred Law. There is mention of śūdras engaged in
manufacture and commerce, and by Mauryan times many śūdras were free
peasants.15 śūdra had place of sorts in Hindu fold, and was
encouraged to imitate customs of higher classes. Though he might
not hear Vedas, Epics and Puranas were open to him, and he had a
part in devotional religion which became more and more popular from
postMauryan times onwards, and ultimately eclipsed older cults; in the
Bhagavad Gītā lord K
a himself promises full salvation to those
śūdras who turn to him.16 From point of view of most medieval sects,
class and caste were affairs of body rather than of spirit, and verses
expressing fundamental equality of all men r to be found in Dravidian
devotional literature and in vernacular religious literature of later times.

Theoretically Buddhism and Jainism made no class distinctions in religious
affairs. As we hv seen, śūdra kings were not unknown, and many śūdras,
despite injunctions of lawbooks, must hv been prosperous.



UNTOUCHABLES
Below śūdras were early representatives of people who were
later called untouchables, outcastes, depressed classes, or scheduled castes.

Buddhist literature and early Dharma Sūtras show that several centuries
before Christ there already existed groups of people who, though serving
the Āryans in very menial and dirty tasks, were looked on as quite outside
the pale. Sometimes they were called “fifth class” ( pañcama), but most
authorities rejected this term, as if to insist that they were excluded from the
Āryan social order altogether.

Numerous groups of these people r mentioned, by names which are
non-Āryan in origin, and were probably those of aboriginal tribes [Page
145] which came under sway of advancing Āryans. Chief of these
groups was caṇḍ āla, term which came to be used loosely for many
types of untouchable. caṇḍāla was not allowed to live in an Āryan
town or village, but had to dwell in special quarters outside boundaries.

Though some caṇḍālas had other means of livelihood, in theory their main
task was carrying and cremation of corpses, and they also served as
executioners of criminals.

According to lawbooks caṇḍāla should be dressed in the
garments of corpses he cremated, should eat his food from broken
vessels, and should wear only iron ornaments. No man of higher class
might hv any but most distant relations with caṇḍāla, on pain of
losing his religious purity and falling to caṇḍāla’s level. By Gupta times
caṇḍālas had become so strictly untouchable that, like lepers in medieval
Europe, they were forced to strike wooden clapper on entering town, to
warn Āryans of their polluting approach.

Certain classes of outcastes or untouchables seem to hv gained their
unenviable position through growth of sentiment of nonviolence-for
instance niṣ āda, who was hunter, fishing caste called kaivarta, and
the leather worker ( kārāvara). pukkusa,3 who appears as sweeper in
Buddhist literature, may hv fallen in status because members of his class
made and sold alcoholic liquor. More difficult to account for r such base
classes as basket-maker ( veṇ a) and chariot-maker ( rathakāra). In early
Vedic times latter was most respected craftsmen, but soon fell to the
status of an impure śūdra or outcaste.

By beginning of Christian era outcastes themselves had
developed caste hierarchy, and had their own outcastes. Manu17 mentions
the antyāvasāyin, cross between caṇḍāla and nisada, who was
despised even by caṇḍālas themselves. In later India every untouchable
group imagined that some other group was lower than itself, and this
stratification evidently began quite early.

Even lot of untouchable was not altogether without hope. Though
he was denied access to temples and comforts of orthodox religion,
Buddhist monks preached to him, and more enlightened wandering
ascetics would give him instruction. untouchable dying in defence of
brāhmaṇs, cows, women, and children secured place in heaven. Orthodox
texts contain frequent warnings on evils which arise when śūdras and
outcastes grow too powerful, and this would seem to show that caṇḍāla
might occasionally become influential.

Another class of untouchable was mleccha, word commonly used
for outer barbarians of whatever race or colour. As an invader [Page 146] he
was loathed, but once he had come into contact with Indian ways and was
less strange and forbidding his status might improve. In fact it was not
blood which made group untouchable, but conduct. Generally there was
no chance of an individual rising in social scale, but for group this was
possible, over number of generations, by adopting more orthodox
practices and following rules of Smśtis. Thus Indian class system
was always somewhat fluid.



“CONFUSION OF CLASS”
An early legend tells of Viśvāmitra, ksatriya who, by penance and piety,
became brāhmaṇ and seer ( rsi) to boot; but as time went on such raising
of one’s status became more and more difficult, and finally virtually
impossible, though convenient fictions sometimes permitted kings and
chiefs of low status to find legendary ksatriya ancestors and advance in the
class hierarchy. While it became very difficult for individual to rise, it
grew progressively more easy for him to fall. Every breach of manifold
regulations of one’s class entailed impurity and outcasting, either permanent
or temporary. lawbooks give long lists of penances for restoration
of unfortunate offender, ranging from trivial ones, such as bathing, or
touching Ganges’ water, to others so rigorous that they must usually have
resulted in death of penitent. Secular literature, however, tells many
stories of high-class people infringing rules of purity without doing
penance, and no doubt more sophisticated townsman often took his
class responsibilities lightly.

The continual injunctions to king to ensure that “confusion of class”
( varṇ a-saṃ kara) did not take place indicate that such confusion was an
ever-present danger in mind of orthodox brāhmaṇ. class system
was indeed very fragile thing. In golden age classes were stable,
but legendary king Vena (p. 87), among his many other crimes, had
encouraged miscegenation, and from this beginning confusion of class had
increased, and was special feature of Kali-yuga, last degenerate
age of this æon, which was fast nearing its close. good king, therefore,
should spare no effort to maintain purity of classes, and many
dynasties took special pride in their efforts in this direction.

Before tightening of social system in Middle Ages confusion
of class was comparatively frequent, and some forms of interclass marriage
were expressly permitted. type of marriage known to anthropologists as
hypergamous, when husband is of higher class than wife, was by no
means disapproved of; on [Page 147] other hand hypogamous marriage,
when wife’s status was higher than that of husband, was always
frowned on. former was “in accordance with direction of hair”
( anuloma), smooth and natural, while latter was “against hair”, or
“brushing wrong way” ( pratiloma). This distinction is to be found in
other societies; for instance in Victorian England peer who married an
actress rarely incurred same scorn and ostracism as lady who
married her groom.

The earlier legal literature permitted anuloma or hypergamous marriage,
provided that man’s first wife was of his own class. Generally brāhmaṇs
were forbidden to take śūdra wives, but one lawbook allowed even this,18
and Bana, 7th-century poet, who was brāhmaṇ, had stepbrother by a
śūdra mother. Various mixed classes, many of dm forerunners of later
castes, were said to be products of marriages of this type, and their
members were not looked on as in any way unclean, but enjoyed position
intermediate between that of two parents. Of groups thought to have
descended from hypergamous marriage only nisada, in theory cross
between brāhmaṇ and śūdra woman, was thought to be impure.

Hypogamous or pratiloma marriage, on other hand, produced
offspring whose status was lower than that of either parent. Thus the
caṇḍālas were believed to hv descended from marriages between śūdras
and brāhmaṇ women. only exceptions were class of charioteers, or
sūtas, thought to hv sprung from hypogamy of ksatriyas and
brāhmaṇs, and bards or māgadhas, descended from vaiśya fathers and
ksatriya mothers, both of whom were well respected. complex system
of sub-classes low in social scale, out of which Indian caste system
developed, was believed to be wholly result of “confusion of class”.

This tradition was accepted by early Indologists, but, as we shall see, is
completely unfounded.



CASTE
Relations between classes and social groups in later Hinduism were
governed by rules of endogamy (marriage was only legitimate within the
group), commensality (food was only to be received from and eaten in the
presence of members of same or higher group), and craft-
exclusiveness (each man was to live by trade or profession of his own
group, and not take up that of another). Megasthenes noted seven
endogamous and craft-exclusive classes in India-philosophers, peasants,
herdsmen, craftsmen and traders, soldiers, government officials and
councillors. His sevenfold division is certainly [Page 148] false, but he
gives evidence to show that in Mauryan times class divisions were already
hardening. Even in Gupta period, however, regulations were by no
means rigid. Hypergamous intermarriage was recognized, rule of craft-
exclusiveness was often ignored, or circumvented by convenient escape
clauses of apaddharma (p. 140), and in earlier lawbooks brāhmaṇ
was permitted to accept food from any Āryan. It was only in late medieval
times that it was finally recognized that exogamy and sharing meals with
members of other classes were quite impossible for respectable people.

These customs, and many others such as widow-remarriage, were classed as
kalivarjya—customs once permissible, but to be avoided in this dark Kali
age, when men r no longer naturally righteous.

In whole of this chapter we hv hardly used word which in most
minds is most strongly connected with Hindu social order. When the
Portuguese came to India in 16th century they found Hindu
community divided into many separate groups, which they called castas,
meaning tribes, clans or families. name stuck, and became usual
word for Hindu social group. In attempting to account for the
remarkable proliferation of castes in 18th– and 19th– century India,
authorities credulously accepted traditional view that by process of
intermarriage and subdivision 3,000 or more castes of modern India had
evolved from four primitive classes, and term “caste” was applied
indiscriminately to both varna or class, and jāti or caste proper. This is a
false terminology; castes rise and fall in social scale, and old castes die
out and new ones r formed, but four great classes r stable. They are
never more or less than four, and for over 2,000 years their order of
precedence has not altered. All ancient Indian sources make sharp
distinction between two terms; varṇ is much referred to, but jāti very
little, and when it does appear in literature it does not always imply the
comparatively rigid and exclusive social groups of later times. If caste is
defined as system of groups within class, which r normally
endogamous, commensal and craft-exclusive, we hv no real evidence of
its existence until comparatively late times.

Caste is development of thousands of years, from association of
many different racial and other groups in single cultural system. It is
impossible to show its origin conclusively, and we cn do little more than
faintly trace its development, since early literature paid scant attention to it;
but it is practically certain that caste did not originate from four classes.

Admittedly it developed later than they, but this proves nothing. There were
subdivisions in four classes at very early date, but brāhmaṇ gotras,
which go back [Page 149] to Vedic times, r not castes, since gotras are
exogamous, and members of same gotra r to be found in many castes.

Perhaps first faint trace of caste is to be found in careful
cataloguing of trades and professions in later Vedic literature, as if their
members were looked on almost as distinct species. In Pali scriptures
many trades and professions r described as living apart; thus we read of
villages of brāhmaṇs, potters, hunters and robbers, and of separate quarters
in towns for different trades and professions. Many trades were
organized in guilds, in which some authorities hv seen origin of the
trade castes; but these trade groups cannot be counted as fully developed
castes. 5th-century inscription from Mandasor19 shows us guild of silk-
weavers emigrating in body from Lata (the region of lower Narmada)
to Mandasor, and taking up many other crafts and professions, from
soldiering to astrology, but still maintaining its guild-consciousness. We
have no evidence that this group was endogamous or commensal, and it was
certainly not craft-exclusive; but its strong corporate sense is that of caste
in making. Hsüan Tsang, in 7th century, was well aware of four
classes, and also mentioned many mixed classes, no doubt accepting the
orthodox view of time that these sprang from intermarriage of the
four, but he shows no clear knowledge of existence of caste in its
modern form.

To present day life of lower orders is much more affected by
caste than by varṇa-it is not being vaiśya or śūdra, but being an ahir, a
kāyasth, or sonār which matters, and corporate feeling is centred around
this caste group, whether based on region, race, profession or religion. The
same strong corporate sense existed among Mandasor silk weavers, and
evidence of its existence at an even earlier date cn be gathered from many
sources. Indian society developed very complex social structure, arising
partly from tribal affiliations and partly from professional associations,
which was continuously being elaborated by introduction of new racial
groups into community, and by development of new crafts. In the
Middle Ages system became more or less rigid, and social group
was now caste in modern sense. Professor J. H. Hutton has interpreted
the caste system as an adaptation of one of most primitive of social
relationships, whereby small clan, living in comparatively isolated
village, would hold itself aloof from its neighbours by complex system of
taboos, and he has found embryonic caste features in social structure of
some of wild tribes of present-day India. caste system may well be
the natural response of many small and primitive peoples who were
forced to come to terms with more complex economic and social system.

It [Page 150] did not develop out of four Āryan varnas, and two
systems hv never been thoroughly harmonized.

By end of our period many of present-day caste groups were
already in existence. Even brāhmaṇ class was much subdivided into
endogamous groups, often based on locality and race, with many different
practices. Rajputs were divided into clans which, if not regularly
endogamous, were castes of sort, and vaiśyas, śūdras, and
untouchables had evolved hundreds of castes. They were governed by local
committees of elders, usually hereditary, which had power to expel
members and regulate caste rules, and whose decisions, from time of the
Arthaśāstra onwards, had force of law.

After large joint family, caste provided social security, helping
destitute members and providing for widows and orphans. man expelled
from his caste was also automatically expelled from his family, unless the
whole family accompanied him in his social ostracism. He was lost to
society, and could only consort with lowest of low. Though he might
sometimes retain some of his former wealth he was isolated, tree torn up
by roots. Permanent loss of caste was greatest catastrophe, short of
death and major chronic diseases, which could happen to man.

Early Tamil literature gives no evidence of caste, but growth of Āryan
influence and development of more complex political and economic
structure produced system in some ways more rigid than that of North.

By Cōla period an important feature of South Indian caste structure had
appeared, which has survived to present day. In Dravidian country
families claiming to be ksatriyas were few, other than ruling families,
and vaiśyas were equally rare. Nearly whole of population were
brāhmaṇs, śūdras or untouchables, and śūdra castes, which formed the
mass of people, were divided into two great caste groups, known as the
right and left hands. great animosity and rivalry which still exists
between these groups is at least thousand years old. On right r the
trading castes, some weaving castes, musicians, potters, washermen,
barbers, and most of cultivating and labouring castes; on left are
various castes of craftsmen, such as weavers and leather workers, cowherds,
and some cultivating castes. We hv no evidence of how this strange
bisection of society arose.

Hypergamy never wholly disappeared. In Malabar, where matrilinear
succession has continued almost to modern times, men of great
brāhmaṇ caste of Nambūdiris hv regularly married women of the
dominant secular caste, Nayyars. In Bengal Raḍhi caste of
brāhmaṇs and important and respectable castes of [Page 151] scribes
( kāyastha) and doctors ( vaidya) r divided into subcastes, which are
hypergamous. system is known as “kulīnism”, from name of the
highest subcaste of brāhmaṇs ( kulina); it was by tradition imposed by
the Bengal king Vallala Sena (12th century), but is no doubt survival from
much earlier times.

The organization of castes, independent of government, and with
social ostracism as its most severe sanction, was powerful factor in the
survival of Hinduism. Hindu, living under an alien political order
imposed from above, retained his cultural individuality largely through his
caste, which received most of loyalty elsewhere felt towards king,
nation and city. Caste was so strong that all attempts at breaking it down,
until recent years, hv ended in failure. Equalitarian religious reformers of
the late Middle Ages, such as Basava, Ramanand, and Kabir, tried to
abolish caste among their followers; but their sects soon took on the
characteristics of new castes, and in some cases divided into castes within
themselves. Sikhs, despite outspoken sentiments of their gurus and
the adoption of rites deliberately intended to break down caste prejudice,
such as ritual meal eaten in common, did not overcome caste feeling.

Even Muslims, for all their equalitarian faith, formed caste groups. The
Syrian Christians of Malabar early divided into sections which took on a
caste character, and when in 16th century Roman Catholic missionaries
began to make converts in South India their flocks brought their caste
prejudices with them, and highcaste converts held themselves aloof from
those of lower orders.

Only in last fifty years has caste system shown real signs of
breaking down, thanks to many inventions of West not designed for
use in society divided into watertight compartments, spread of
Western education, growing national sentiment, and intensive
propaganda of enlightened leaders. process is not yet complete, and it
will be many years before all trace of caste feeling is eradicated; but when
Mahatma Gāndhī, in many ways socially conservative, persuaded his
followers to sweep their own floors and clean their own latrines he sounded
the death knell of old Hindu social order, which, for all its faults, has
preserved identity of Indian society over centuries of foreign
domination.



SLAVERY
Megasthenes declared that there were no slaves in India. He was
certainly wrong, but Indian slavery was milder than form to which he
had been used, and slaves were much less numerous than in civilizations
of West; hence he may not hv recognized [Page 152] dāsa as a
slave. There was no caste of slaves; though Arthaśāstra declares that
servitude is not in nature of Āryan (in which term humble śūdra
is explicitly included), an individual of any class might in certain
circumstances become slave, although most slaves were no doubt of low
caste.

The word dāsa originally meant member of peoples conquered by
the Āryans in their first invasions of India. Its later connotation no doubt
developed from reduction to bondage of many dasas captured in
battle, and here we find probable origin of Indian slavery. The
Mahābhārata declares that it is law of war that vanquished should be
the victor’s slave, 20 and captive would normally serve his captor until
ransomed. But there were several other classes of slaves in later times.

Children born of slaves normally became slaves of their parents’
masters. Slaves might be bought, given away, or mortgaged. free man
might sell himself and his family into slavery in times of dire distress. He
might also be reduced to slavery for crime or debt, but in these cases his
servitude might be only temporary. All these types of slavery are
recognized in Smrti literature and elsewhere.

As in other slave-owning civilizations, slave might become an
important man, and there r even references in stories to slaves serving as
royal counsellors. Slaves might sometimes perform work of economic
importance, such as agriculture or mining, but they were usually domestic
servants or personal attendants. slave was, in fact, subordinate
member of his master’s household. His maintenance was his master’s
responsibility, and if he died sonless it was incumbent on master to
perform funeral and commnemorative rites for welfare of his soul.

According to most lawbooks slave’s property ultimately belonged to his

master, and he might be bought, sold, loaned or given away; but masters
had no rights over lives of their slaves, and were not allowed to abandon
them in old age, as was done in many other ancient civilizations. “A man
may go short himself or stint his wife and children, but never his slave, who
does his dirty work for him. “21 Some lawbooks even limit right of a
master to give corporal punishment to his slave. “A wife, son, slave, a
servant or younger brother may, when they do wrong, be beaten with a
rope or cane, but only on back and not on head. If man beats
them otherwise he should be punished as thief.” 22 manumission of a
slave is commended by textbooks as pious act, and in any case a
person enslaved for debt became free when he had paid debt with his
labour.

The Arthaśāstra, in many ways more liberal than religious lawbooks,
lays down regulations appreciably milder than those we [Page 153] have
outlined. sale of children into slavery is explicitly forbidden except in
dire emergency. Slaves r entitled to own and inherit property, and to earn
money freely in their spare time. Slaves of upper classes cannot be
forced to perform defiling duties. chastity of slave-girls is protected-the
master who rapes slavegirl must set her free and pay her compensation,
and if she has child by her master, even with her own consent, both
mother and child become free. promise made by man in dire necessity
to sell himself and his family into slavery is not binding.

The humane regulations of Arthaśāstra, probably unique in the
records of any ancient civilization, r perhaps survivals of Mauryan laws,
and it is therefore not surprising that Megasthenes declared that there was
no slavery in India. India, unlike most ancient civilizations, was never
economically dependent on slavery; labourer, farm worker, and
craftsman alike were normally free men, and latifundia of Roman
magnate had no counterpart in India. Slave markets r not mentioned in
early sources, and though provision was made for sale of slaves they do
not seem at first to hv been regular article of commerce. In early
centuries of Christian era, however, there was trade in slave-girls
between India and Roman empire in both directions, and slave markets
existed in 16th-century Vijayanagara empire.

There r numerous references in literature to slaves being badly treated
by their masters, and slave’s lot must hv been often very unhappy
one; but he was probably better off in India than in most parts of ancient
world. Indeed in many contexts it would seem that word dasa implies
rather bondman or serf than chattel slave.



GOTRA AND PRAVARA
The Hindu social order was complicated by other features which had no
original relationship to class or caste, but were roughly harmonized with
them. These r institutions of gotra and pravara, which were in
existence in late Vedic times, and probably earlier, and r very important to
the orthodox brāhmaṇ to this day.

The original meaning of gotra is “a cowshed”, or “a herd of cows”; in the
Atharva Veda, 23 word first appears with meaning of “a clan”, which
it has retained with special connotation. Some ancient Indo-European
peoples, such as Romans, had exogamous clans, as well as generally
endogamous tribes. It may well be that gotra system is survival of
Indo-European origin which had developed specially Indian features.

Gotra as it existed in historical times was primarily brāhmaṇic [Page
154] institution, adopted rather half-heartedly by other twice-born classes,
and hardly affecting lower orders. All brāhmaṇs were believed to have
descended from one or other ṛṣi, or legendary seer, after whom gotras
were named. religious literature generally speaks of seven or eight
primeval gotras, those of Kasyapa, Vasistha, Bhrgu, Gautama, Bharadvaja,
Atri and Viśvāmitra. eighth gotra, that of Agastya, is named after the
sage who is said to hv taken Vedic religion beyond Vindhyas, and
who is sort of patron saint of Dravidians. His name may hv been
added to those of original seven as South became progressively
Āryanized. These primeval gotras were multiplied in later times by the
inclusion of names of many other ancient sages.

Though gotras perhaps evolved from local units within Āryan
tribe they had quite lost their tribal character by historical times, and
brāhmaṇs from furthest parts of India and of different caste groups
might hv same gotra. chief importance of gotra was in connexion
with marriage, which was forbidden to persons of same gotra.

The position was further complicated by pravara. In brāhmaṇ’s daily worship he mentioned not only name of founder of his gotra, but also names of certain other sages who were believed to be remote ancestors of his family. formula generally contained three or five names, and set up further bar to marriage, for same names would occur in pravaras of families of other gotras. acc to custom of some gotras, marriage was impossible with member of another gotra having one pravara name in common, while others barred intermarriage only when there were two common names in pravaras. Thus matrimonial choice was much restricted, especially when in Middle Ages endogamous caste system was fully established.

The social prestige of brāhmaṇs led to respectable classes adopting gotra system of some sort. Ksatriyas and vaiśyas took same gotra names as brāhmaṇs; their gotras, however, were not based on the claim to descent from an ancient sage, but merely on gotra of family of brāhmaṇs which traditionally performed their domestic rituals. As imposed on non-brāhmaṇic families system was quite artificial. Non- brāhmaṇ families were also expected to take pravaras of their domestic priests, but this rule counted for little. real gotras of ksatriyas and vaiśyas were secular ( laukika) ones, founded by legendary eponymous ancestors. Legal literature takes little note of these secular gotras, but numerous references in inscriptions show that term was used in the sense of [Page 155] “sept” or “clan”, and that many non-brāhmaṇ gotras existed which do not occur in lists of any of lawbooks.

Early lawgivers take comparatively liberal view of breaches of gotra regulations. man marrying woman of same gotra must perform a cāndrāyaṇ penance, severe fast of month’s duration, and henceforth maintain his wife as he would sister;24 no stigma attaches to child of such marriage. With ruthless logic, however, later jurists declare that this rule applies only to inadvertent marriage within gotra; when the relationship is known sin is equivalent to that of incest.

THE FAMILY
The Indian family was, and usually still is, joint one-that is to say a close link was maintained between brothers, uncles, cousins and nephews, who often lived under one roof or group of roofs, and who owned the immovable property of line in common. Like European and Semitic  family, it was patriarchal and patrilinear. father was head of house jand administrator of joint property, and, except in Malabar (p. 174f), the headship descended in male line.

The ancient Indian family included parents, children, grandchildren, uncles and their descendants, and various collaterals on male side. It might include adopted children, and unless poor it would also possess a varying number of servants, domestic serfs, and clients; brāhmaṇ family might, in addition, find room for number of students, who were engaged in lengthy course of training under head of house, and were treated as members of family. Thus, especially in polygamous society where girls were married very young, it formed very large group.

The family, rather than individual, was looked on as unit of the social system; thus population of given region was generally estimated in families rather than in heads. bonds of family were such that relationships within group were often blurred or lost sight of; for instance son might commonly refer co all his father’s wives indiscriminately as his mothers, and distinction between brother and paternal cousin was not always made clearly-even today same word is used for both.

The group was bound together by śrāddha, rite of commemorating the ancestors, at which balls of rice called piṇḍ were offered (p. 177).

Sons, grandsons and great-grandsons of deceased joined together in śrāddha, and three generations of dead were [Page 156] believed to participate in benefits of ceremony. Thus dead and living were linked together by this rite, which, like ancestor worship of the Chinese, was most potent force in consolidating family. śrāddha defined family; those who were entitled to participate in ceremony were “co-piṇḍas” ( sapiṇḍ a), members of family group. rite, which is still practised, goes back to Vedic times.

This deep sense of family solidarity led, as might be expected, to
nepotism and various other abuses, and today joint family system is
beginning to weigh heavily on younger generations; but it gave a
measure of social security to its members. In distress man could rely on
his sapindas, and ne’er-do-well cousin or indolent good-for-nothing
uncle, living in corner of family home in comparative comfort while
adding little or nothing to family fortunes, was probably just as common
a figure in ancient India as he is today.

Though powerful and awe-inspiring figure, paterfamilias was not
usually an arbitrary tyrant; his power, like that of king, was somewhat
limited by Sacred Law and custom. jurists differed on question of
his rights over family property. In modern times there r two great
schools of family law, called after legal texts on which they r based
Mitākṣ arā and Dāyabhāga (p. 113); most families of Bengal and Assam
follow rules of Dayabhaga, while rest of India generally follows
Mitākṣarā. acc to latter school sons and grandsons hv right
in family property even before death of paterfamilias, who is
little more than trustee and manager on behalf of family, without the
right to give property away so as to impoverish his dependents. Dayabhaga
maintains that sons only obtain rights over property on death of the
father, but even this school recognizes that he is not an outright owner, but
only steward for his descendants. Both schools existed in medieval times,
and represent codifications of much earlier practices.

At very early time fathers may hv had absolute rights over their
children, for certain ancient and popular stories remind us of Hebrew
legends of Abraham and Isaac and Jephthah’s daughter. most famous of
these is story of Śunahśepa.

King Hariścandra of Ayodhya was childless, and vowed that if he had a
son he would sacrifice him to god Varuṇa. Soon son was born to him,
and named Rohita; but Hariscandra was naturally disinclined to perform his
share of bargain. In punishment Varuna afflicted him with dropsy. After
some years he decided to sacrifice Rohita, who was now youth, but he

refused to give his life for sake of his father’s health, and fled to the
forest, where he lived for six years.

PLATE XXXVIII
[Page 157] One day Rohita met brāhmaṇ, Ajigarta, and bought his
second son Śunahśepa for hundred cows, as substitute for himself.

Varuna agreed to accept sacrifice of Śunahśepa in place of Rohita, and
the brāhmaṇ boy was sent to court of Hariscandra to be prepared for
sacrifice. Ajigarta agreed to earn another two hundred cows for binding his
son. to sacrificial stake and slaying him. sacrifice was made ready,
and Śunahśepa led to slaughter; he commenced to sing hymns in praise
of gods, and his devotion was such that Varuna was moved to
compassion. Hariscandra was cured of his disease, and Śunahśepa lived to
become great and famous sage.

Another well-known story of same tenor is that of Naciketas, the
interlocutor of Katha Upanisad.

The brāhmaṇ Vajasravasa gave away all his wealth to priests performing
sacrifices on his behalf, having promised to give up all that he possessed.

His son, Naciketas, saw that he still had one possession, and asked “Dear
Father, to whom will you give me?” father made no reply, but when
Naciketas repeated question third time he said angrily, “I shall give
you to Death!”
Naciketas obediently went to palace of Yama, god of dead, but
found him not at home; only after he had waited for three nights did god
return. Yama so regretted his impoliteness in keeping guest waiting for so
long that he offered Naciketas three boons. With first boy was
restored to life, and his father pacified; with second he learnt secret
of fire sacrifice; and with third he obtained from Yama full
knowledge of mystery of life after death, which makes up body of
the poem.

Certain early legal texts do allow father to give away, sell or abandon
his son, 25 and legends we hv mentioned would confirm that this was
done, 4 but other sources positively forbid such action.26 father’s right
over life of his child is nowhere explicitly admitted, but Arthaśāstra
looks on killing of son as among most heinous forms of murder;
on other hand even parricide is permissible in self-defence.

Left to itself, joint family would tend to increase in size until it became
so large as to be unmanageable; hence Sacred Law made provision for
its break-up. partition of large joint family was favoured by the
lawyers, since thus more domestic rites would be performed, and gods
receive more honour and bless land more readily. Commonly partition
took place on death of paterfamilias, when property was divided
among sons. There was no provision for wills in ancient India, and the
eldest son received no special inheritance, except sometimes very small
weightage amounting to one twentieth of share. partition of the
family property [Page 158] was not necessarily postponed until father’s
death. It regularly occurred if he renounced world to become an ascetic,
and under Mitaksara system it might take place even without his
consent, by agreement among sons, if he was senile, incurably diseased,
had taken to evil courses, or was otherwise incapable of managing the
family affairs. Individual sons, like Prodigal in Gospel, might
demand their share and leave family, though this was not wholly
approved, and was virtually impossible under Dayabhaga system.

In partition minute rules, varying somewhat with different authorities,
were laid down as to shares to be received by other relatives when there
were no sons. Most authorities rejected rights of women to inherit; but
Yājñvalkya27 lays down an authoritative list of priority in inheritance,
which places wife, followed by daughters, immediately after the
sons. right of wife to inherit if no sons were living was accepted by
the Mitākṣarā school, which was chiefly based on Yājñvalkya.

The joint family property did not include individual possessions of
the members; at least from medieval times onwards personal earnings, gifts,
and so on were generally thought to belong to member of family
who earned them. This was, however, probably late concept. Manu28, for
instance, states that property of son, wife, or slave belongs to head
of household, and same precept is repeated by some other early
lawgivers; rights of paterfamilias, it would seem, tended to grow
less with time.



THE FOUR STAGES OF LIFE
We hv seen that for theorist society involved two concepts; one of
these was class, or varṇ a, while other was stage of life, or asrama. This
was later idea than that of class, and was evidently more artificial. Just as
Āryan society was divided into four classes, so life of individual
Āryan was divided into four stages; on his investiture with sacred
thread, when he put his childhood behind him, he became brahmacārin,
leading celibate and austere life as student at home of his teacher;
next, having mastered Vedas, or part of them, he returned to his parental
home, and was married, becoming householder ( grhastha); when, well
advanced in middle age, he had seen his children’s children and had thus
surely established his line, he left his home for forest to become a
hermit ( vānaprastha); by meditation and penance he freed his soul from
material things, until at last, very old man, he left his hermitage, and
became homeless wanderer ( sannyāsin), with all his earthly ties broken.

[Page 159] This scheme, of course, represents ideal rather than the
real. Many young men never passed through first stage of life in the
form laid down, while only few went beyond second. Many of the
hermits and ascetics of ancient India were evidently not old men, and had
either shortened or omitted stage of householder. series of four
stages is evidently an idealization of facts, and an artificial attempt to
find room for conflicting claims of study, family life, and asceticism in a
single lifetime. It is possible that system of āśamas was evolved
partly as counterblast to unorthodox sects such as Buddhism and
Jainism, which encouraged young men to take up asceticism, and by-pass
family life altogether, practice which did not receive approval of the
orthodox, though in later times provision was made for it. Despite their
artificiality, however, four stages of life were an ideal which many men
in ancient India attempted to follow, and thus they deserve our
consideration. Moreover they serve as framework round which we can
model life of individual.

According to scheme of four stages life began not with physical
birth, but with second birth, or investiture with sacred thread. Thus
the child was not full member of Āryan community, but nevertheless
his existence was hedged around with religious rites, which began even
before his birth. Few religions cn hv marked course of life of
their members with so many rites and ceremonies as Hinduism. According
to most orthodox calculations there were some forty ceremonies
( saṃ skāra), which covered whole life of man from his conception to
his death, some of which were of great importance, and were performed by
all respectable members of Āryan community.



THE CHILD
Of various saṃskāra, or personal ceremonies, in life of pious
Hindu first three took place before birth: these were garbhādhāna to
promote conception, puṃ savana, to procure male child, and
simantonnayana, to ensure safety of child in womb. birth
ceremony ( jātakarma) took place before cutting of umbilical cord,
and involved whispering of sacred spells ( mantra) in baby’s ear,
placing mixture of honey and ghee in his mouth, and giving him name,
to be kept secret by his parents until his initiation. At birth child and his
parents were ritually impure, and therefore not entitled to take part in
ordinary religious ceremonies until some ten days later, when child was
given his public name and period of impurity ceased. Minor rites of
infancy, not [Page 160] always looked on as particularly sacred, were the
ear-piercing ceremony, and niskramana, when child was taken out of
the house, and shown sun for first time.

More important was first feeding (annaprasana). In child’s sixth
month he was given mouthful of meat, fish, or rice (in later times usually
the latter) mixed with curds, honey and ghee, to accompaniment of
Vedic verses and oblations of ghee poured on fire. tonsure
(cūdākarma) took place in third year, and was confined to boys; with
various rites child’s scalp was shaved, leaving only topknot, which, in
the case of pious brāhmaṇ, would never be cut throughout his life.

Another ceremony, not looked on as of first importance, was carried out
when child first began to learn alphabet.

Many of these ceremonies r now rarely if ever practised in their full
form, and it is doubtful if every ancient Indian family, even of higher
classes, performed dm regularly, especially in case of girls. Their
number, however, shows importance of child in life of his
parents. From earliest hymns of Ṛ g Veda sons were looked on as
great blessings. At least one son was almost essential, to perform funeral
rites for his father, and thus ensure his safe transit to other world.

Adopted sons were but poor substitutes for true sons, and their efficacy at
sraddha ceremonies was dubious. Thus there were strong religious reasons
for procreation of children. intense family feeling of Hindu India
enhanced desire for sons, without whom line would disappear.

Girls, on other hand, were incapable either of helping their parents in
the other world or of perpetuating line, for on marriage, acc to
orthodox practice, they became members of their husbands’ families. The
necessity of providing dm with dowries also lessened their desirability.

There were thus very practical reasons why girls should be unwanted, and
in civilization so heavily weighted in favour of male it is surprising
that there is little evidence of exposure or infanticide of girls. Rajput
families in later times certainly often destroyed their infant girls, and the
same may well hv been done by very poor at all periods; but no
special reference is made to exposure or infanticide in early legal texts.

In best Indian families daughters, though their birth may hv been
regretted, were cared for and petted just as sons.

The general impression obtained from literature is that in ancient
India child’s life was happy one. Maxims of type of “spare rod
and spoil child” r rare or non-existent. small child of ancient
India was generally pampered, humoured, and allowed degree of freedom
which few children in Europe obtained [Page 161] until modern times. The
loving descriptions of children in poetry nearly always show dm as the
spoilt darlings of their parents. Thus Kalidasa:
“With their teeth half-shown in causeless laughter,
and their efforts at talking so sweetly uncertain,
when children ask to sit on his lap
a man is blessed, even by dirt on their bodies.”29
The speaker of this verse is great king, and it shows us even little
children of princes playing naked in dust, and loved with tenderness by
their elders.

But undisciplined life of small child soon came to an end. For the
poor child there was work to do almost as soon as he could walk, and for
the wealthier there were lessons. Normally boy began to learn the
alphabet in his fourth or fifth year. In richer homes tutors were
maintained for children of family, but, in Middle Ages,
education was also given at village schools attached to temples. Though
women’s education was never looked on as essential, girls were by no
means neglected, and well-bred women were usually literate.

The curriculum of child’s early studies seems always to hv included
reading and elementary arithmetic, but at this stage of his life he was not a
full member of Āryan community, and his formal schooling had not yet
commenced. Only on his investiture with sacred thread was he ready to
learn Vedas and embark on detailed course of study calculated to
equip him for his ancestral calling.



INITIATION
The great rite of upanayana, second birth, whereby boy became a
full member of his class and of society, was confined to brāhmaṇs,
ksatriyas, and vaiśyas. śūdras and lower orders could not undergo it,
and were never allowed to hear or learn most sacred of scriptures.

The ideal age for ceremony varied acc to class-eight for a
brāhmaṇ, eleven for ksatriya, and twelve for vaiśya.

It was very ancient rite, going back to times before Āryans divided
into Indian and Iranian branches, for Zoroastrians had similar
ceremony, form of which is still practised by modern Pārsīs. The
kernel of ceremony was investing of boy, clad in garments of
an ascetic and with staff in his hand, with sacred thread ( yajñopavāta),
which was hung over his right shoulder, and under his left arm, and which
he was expected to wear continuously from that day forward. It was cord
of three threads, each [Page 162] of nine twisted strands, made of cotton,
hemp, or wool, for brāhmaṇs, ksatriyas, and vaiśyas respectively, and it had
great religious significance, which it still has for orthodox. Its removal
or defilement involved its owner in great humiliation and ritual impurity,
which could only be expunged by rigorous penance.

The ceremony also involved whispering of Gāyatrī in ear of
the initiate by officiating brāhmaṇ. This is verse from hymn of the
Ṛ g Veda,30 addressed to old solar god Savitr, which is still looked on as
the most holy passage of that most holy scripture. It is repeated in all
religious rites and ceremonies, and has position in Hinduism rather like
that of Lord’s Prayer in Christianity, except that Gayatri may only be
uttered by three higher classes.

Tát Savitur váreniam
bhārgo devásya dhīmahi,
dhiyo yó nah pracodáyāt.

Let us think on lovely splendour
of god Savitr,
that he may inspire our minds.

Probably even before Christian era many ksatriyas and vaiśyas had
ceased to perform initiation ceremony in full form, for term
“twice-born”, applying to all who had undergone ceremony, became
more and more looked on as synonym of brāhmaṇ. Some non-brāhmaṇ
castes, however, maintain ceremony to present day, and it is still
performed in orthodox brāhmaṇ families. Normally initiation was
confined to boys, though in Vedic times girls were also sometimes initiated.

In this initiation ceremony there was little or no trace of overt sexual
symbolism, and it was never thought of, like circumcision and other
initiation ceremonies among more primitive peoples, as rite fitting the
initiate for sexual life. initiated boy was still minor, but he had taken
the status of an Āryan, and it was now his duty to master religious lore
of Āryans in order to prepare himself for role of householder. As a
brahmacārin or religious student he had as yet several years of celibacy
before him.



EDUCATION
According to ideal of sacred texts, training of brahmacarin
took place at home of brāhmaṇ teacher ( guru). In some early sources
the guru is depicted as poor ascetic, and it is one [Page 163] of the
student’s duties to beg food for his teacher, but this rule seems not to have
been regularly followed. student was, however, expected to treat his
teacher with utmost reverence, ministering to all his needs, and obeying
all his commands implicitly.

Among first lessons of student was performance of sandhyā,
the morning, noon, and evening devotions, which included reciting the
Gayatrl, restraint of breath, sipping and sprinkling water, and pouring
libations of water to sun, which was looked on rather as symbol of the
special deity of worshipper, whether Visnu or Śiva, than as Sungod
himself. These rites were incumbent upon all twice-born, and in various
forms r still performed.

The main subject of study was Veda, and long hours were devoted to
its mastery. teacher would instruct few students seated on the
ground about him by rote, and for many hours daily they would repeat verse
after verse of Vedas, until one or more was mastered. Sometimes, to
ensure correctness, hymns were taught in more than one way, first with
the words connected, then in their isolated form ( padapatha), and then with
the words interwoven in ab, be, cd pattern ( kramapātha), or in even more
complicated ways. This remarkable system of mnemonic checks and the
patience and brilliant memories of many generations of teachers and
students preserved Vedas for posterity in much same form as that in
which they existed nearly thousand years before Christ.

The boys in guru’s home did not confine their attention wholly to the
Vedic texts. There were other fields of study, notably “Limbs of the
Veda”, or subsidiary sciences, necessary for its proper understanding. These
six vedāngas consisted of: kalpa, performance of sacrifice; śiksā,
correct pronunciation, or phonetics; chandas, metre and prosody; nirukta,
etymology, interpretation of obscure words in Vedic texts;
vyākarana, grammar; and jyotisa, astronomy, or science of calendar.

Moreover in post-Vedic times teachers would often instruct their students in
the six schools of metaphysics, or in that school which they specially
favoured. Those versed in Sacred Law would expound it to their
students, while others would teach special secular subjects, such as
astronomy, mathematics or literature.

The writers of Smrti envisaged all young men of upper class as
undergoing this training. Such was not case-in fact it is doubtful if more
than small proportion of young men ever went through full course of
Vedic education. Princes and sons of chiefs and nobles were trained in
arms and in all manifold sciences needed to fit dm for government,
while most boys of lower orders [Page 164] probably learnt their trades
from their fathers. Buddhist scriptures, however, show that there was a
form of apprenticeship, and lawbooks lay down rules governing it.

Certain cities became renowned for their learned teachers, and achieved a
reputation comparable to that of university cities of medieval Europe.

Chief among these were Banāras and Taksasila, which were already famous
in time of Buddha; later, around beginning of Christian era,
Kāñcī acquired similar reputation in South. Banaras, then usually
called Kāśī, was particularly renowned for its religious teachers, but
Taksasila, in far NorthWest, laid more emphasis on secular studies. The
Buddhist Jataka tales show that young men from all over civilized part
of India sought education in this city, through which trickle of Iranian and
Mesopotamian influence found its way to India. Among famous learned
men connected with Taksasila were Panini, grammarian of 4th
century B.C. (p. 388), Kautilya, brāhmaṇ minister of Candragupta
Maurya, and traditionally chief master of science of statecraft, and
Caraka, one of two great masters of Indian medical science.

Though it was ideal of Smrtis that small number of students
should study under single teacher, it seems that veritable colleges existed
at these “university towns”. Thus we read of an establishment at Banāras
with 500 students and number of teachers, all of whom were maintained
by charitable donations. Ideally, again, teacher asked no fee; the
students repaid him for his teaching by their reverent service, and only at
the end of their studies was he presented with gift, traditionally cow.

Manu, however, makes it quite clear that there were venal teachers who
were willing to teach Vedas for money. 31 Jataka story tells of a
teacher of Taksasila who made his ordinary pupils wait on him all day,
while those who paid fees were treated like his own children. At Taksasila,
also, rules of Smrti were relaxed in another respect, for we read of
married students, who did not live in their masters’ houses, but had homes
of their own, and only visited their teachers for lectures.

With Buddhism and Jainism education centred not on teacher’s home,
but on monastery. Every monastery might give training to postulants,
but quite early in history of these two religions certain establishments
acquired special reputation as centres of learning. In Middle Ages
some developed into true universities. most famous of these was the
Buddhist monastery of Nalanda in Bihār, which, founded in Gupta times,
remained most famous teaching centre of medieval Buddhism until it
was pillaged by invading Muslims. Our knowledge of day-to-day
life of [Page 165] Nalanda depends chiefly on Hsüan Tsang, who shows us
the monastery in 7th century as full of intellectual activity. Under its
aged and saintly abbot, Śīlabhadra, Nālandā did not confine itself to training
novices for Buddhist order, but also taught Vedas, Hindu philosophy,
logic, grammar and medicine. It would seem that student population
was not confined to Buddhist order, but that students of other faiths who
succeeded in passing strict oral examination were admitted.

According to Hsüan Tsang, Nālandā was supported by revenues of an
enormous estate of one hundred villages, and by alms of many patrons,
including great Harsa himself; it provided free training for no less than
10,000 students, who had large staff of servants to wait on them. The
remains of Nalanda, however, belie Hsüan Tsang (pl. XII). monastery
consisted of very large complex of buildings, but it could hardly have
accommodated thousand monks in anything like comfort described by
the Chinese traveller.

Many other Buddhist monasteries all over country, and Jaina
monasteries in West and South, served as centres of learning, as did
their Christian counterparts in medieval Europe. In Middle Ages a
Hindu monasticism developed, and maṭ has of Hindu orders also
became centres of learning.



MARRIAGE
Ideally studenthood lasted for twelve years, though it might be
terminated when student had mastered one Veda. few very earnest
students took vows of perpetual celibacy, and continued religious studies
throughout their whole lives. Normally, however, young man in his
early twenties would return home, to resume everyday life of his class.

He would take ritual bath, and reward his teacher acc to means
of his family. From now on he was snātaka (“one who has bathed”), and
he might enjoy normal worldly pleasures, eat any kind of food usually eaten
by his class, and wear fine clothes and jewellery, which he put on at a
special homecoming ceremony ( samāvartaṇ a).

It was generally thought advisable for snataka to marry as soon as
possible, for unless he had taken vow of religious celibacy marriage and
the procreation of children were positive duty. Marriage had three main
purposes: promotion of religion by performance of household
sacrifices; progeny, whereby father and his ancestors were assured of a
happy after-life, and line was continued; and rati, or sexual pleasure.

[Page 166] normal religious marriage was and still is arranged by the
parents of couple, after much consultation, and study of omens,
horoscopes, and auspicious physical characteristics. couple were
usually of same class and caste, but of different gotras and pravaras, if
they were of high class. Rules of prohibited degrees were very strict,
especially in Northern India, where, even in caste which disregarded
gotra, marriage was forbidden between persons with common paternal
ancestor within seven generations or maternal ancestor within five. In the
Deccan, however, this rule was not strictly followed, and there r records
of cousin-marriage even in ruling families.

Though in early times it was usual for girls to be fully adult before
marriage, Smrtis recommend that while husband should be at least
twenty girl should be married immediately before puberty. So
philoprogenitive had Hindu orthodoxy become that it was even declared
that father who did not give his daughter in marriage before her first
menstruation incurred guilt of one procuring abortion (a very grave sin,
worse than many kinds of murder) for every menstrual period in which she
remained unmarried.32 general view was that ideal marriage was
one in which bride was one third age of groom-thus man of
twenty-four should marry girl of eight.33
The marriage of boys, whether before or just after puberty, is nowhere
suggested, but ideal of rigorous period of studentship before marriage
is always maintained. child-marriage of both parties, which became
common in later times among well-to-do families, has no basis at all in
sacred literature, and it is very doubtful whether child-marriage of girls
was at all common until late medieval period. heroines of poetry
and fiction r apparently full grown when they marry, and numerous
inscriptions which throw much light on customs of time give little or
no indication of child-marriage. Ancient Indian medical authorities state
that best children r produced from mothers over sixteen, and
apparently recognize practice of child-marriage as occasionally
occurring, but disapprove of it.34
The reasons for development of child-marriage cannot be given with
certainty. Some hv suggested that fear of marauding Muslims
encouraged parents to marry their daughters in childhood and to confine
their wives more strictly in their homes; but both these customs existed in
pre-Muslim times, so this cannot be only reason. It may in part be due to
the growing religious insistence on necessity of progeny, but this was
strong at all times. sexuality of Indian character may hv played
some part in it. [Page 167] woman was thought to be naturally libidinous;
an unmarried girl attaining puberty would proceed to find lover, however
strictly her parents guarded her; once she had lost her virginity she would
become unmarriageable and parents would hv choice of the
disgrace and expense of maintaining an unmarried daughter indefinitely, or
the even greater disgrace of casting her out to become beggar or a
prostitute. From point of view of her parents daughter was serious
economic liability, and this may hv encouraged custom.

Religious marriage was solemnized by very complicated ceremonies, the
expenses of which fell on family of bride, and, with dowry, were
a very heavy burden to her father and family. To this day Hindu parents will
often involve themselves in crippling debts in order to marry their
daughters. Though rules for wedding ceremony laid down in
different textbooks vary in details, rite differed little from that of the
present day, or from marriage ceremony of Ṛ g Veda. The
bridegroom, decked in great finery and attended by train of friends and
relatives, proceeded to bride’s home and was received by her father with
a madhuparka, an auspicious ceremonial drink of honey and curds. Usually
the ceremony was held in gaudy temporary pavilion in courtyard of
the house. Bride and groom entered pavilion separately, and sat on
either side of small curtain. To accompaniment of sacred verses
muttered by officiating brāhmaṇ curtain was removed, and the
couple saw one another, often for first time. bride’s father stepped
forward, and formally gave her to groom, who promised that he would
not behave falsely to her in respect of three traditional aims of life-piety,
wealth, or pleasure. Next, offerings of ghee and rice were made in the
sacred fire. groom then grasped bride’s hand while she offered
grain in fire, round which he then led her, usually with their garments
knotted together, after which she trod on millstone. couple then took
seven steps together, bride treading on small heap of rice at each step.

Then they were sprinkled with holy water and main part of the
ceremony was completed.

As described above rite seems comparatively simple, but it was
complicated by recitation of many mantras, or Vedic and other verses
believed to hv magical and spiritual efficiency. Even at this stage the
marriage ceremony was not completely over. newly married pair
returned to bridegroom’s house, where further sacrifice to the
domestic fire was performed. In evening it was incumbent upon dm to
look at Pole Star, symbol of faithfulness. For three nights couple
were expected to remain continent; in some [Page 168] texts they are
allowed to sleep together with staff between them, but others instruct
them to sleep apart on ground. On fourth night husband
performed rite to promote conception, and marriage was
consummated.5
The length and solemnity of this ceremony will give some idea of the
importance and sanctity of marriage in eyes of ancient Indian lawgivers;
but form of marriage which we hv described, though now regular
among respectable Hindus, was not only one known to ancient India,
and marriage might be considered binding even when religious
ceremony had not been performed. textbooks enumerate eight types of
marriage, named after various gods and supernatural beings:
(1) brāhma, marriage of duly dowered girl to man of same class
by ceremony described above.

(2) Daiva, when householder gives daughter to sacrificial priest as
part of his fee.

(3) Ārṣ a, in which, in place of dowry, there is token bride-price of a
cow and bull.

(4) Prājādpatya, in which father gives girl without dowry and
without demanding bride-price.

(5) Gāndharva, marriage by consent of two parties, which might
be solemnized merely by plighting troth. This form of marriage was often
clandestine.

(6) Asura, marriage by purchase.

(7) Rākṣ asa, marriage by capture.

(8) Paiśāca, which cn scarcely be called marriage at all-the seduction of
a girl while asleep, mentally deranged, or drunk.

Of these eight forms first four were generally approved, and were
permissible to brāhmaṇs; these were religious marriages, and were
indissoluble. other forms were looked on with varying degrees of
disfavour by pious. GĀndharva marriage, which often might amount to
no more than liaison, was surprisingly respected. Some doubts existed as
to whether it was possible to brāhmaṇs, but it was certainly allowed to the
warrior class and lower orders. It forms basis of many romantic
stories, and has given rise to one of stock figures of later poetic
convention-the abhisārikā, girl who secretly leaves her father’s home by
night to meet her lover at appointed trysting place.

Asura marriage, in which bride was bought from her father, was
looked on with disfavour by all sacred texts, though Arthaśāstra
allows it without criticism. There is evidence that [Page 169] marriage by
purchase, as well as orthodox marriage with dowry, existed even in
Vedic times, but it was not true Āryan custom, and was only allowed as a

sop to evil propensities of man. Rākṣ asa marriage, or marriage by
capture, was practised especially by warriors. most famous example,
according to later tradition, was marriage of Prthvlraja Cahamana, the
last great Hindu king of North India, with daughter of Jayaccandra of
Kanyakubja, whom he carried off as not unwilling captive. Epigraphy and
tradition record several other instances. Paiśāca marriage was universally
reprobated. names of last three types r derived from those of
demons, of which Paiśāca was lowest and most repulsive. This form
of marriage, acc to lawbooks, was not fitted for higher
classes, and could only be allowed on suffrance to lower orders.

PLATE XLII
Some authorities hv tried to explain away less reputable forms of
marriage, and to prove that they were non-existent or very rare; but it is
hardly likely that lawgivers would hv admitted these forms, of which
they wholeheartedly disapproved, if they had not had solid basis in
ineluctable social custom. It would seem that, with surprising realism, they
recognized wide range of relationships, so that girl seduced by her
lover’s promises or carried off by raiders would hv some legal claim to
wifely status, and her child some degree of legitimacy. No doubt among the
upper classes most marriages were of first type, and any of other
forms might be solemnized later by religious rites and thus raised in status.

A special form of gandharva marriage was svayaṃ vara or “self-
choice”. law books lay down that if girl is not married by her parents
soon after attaining puberty she may choose her own husband, and
evidently marriage by choice of bride sometimes took place. Epic
literature shows that more than one form of svayamvara was practised.

Princess Sāvitrī toured country in her chariot in search of suitable
mate, until she found Satyavant, woodcutter’s son. Damayanti chose her
husband Nala at great ceremony, at which she passed along assembled
ranks of her suitors until she found man of her choice. Another form of
svayaṃvara was that by which Rama won Slta, at great archery contest.

We hv references to performance of svayaṃvaras as late as 11th
century, for Vikramaditya VI, great king of Calukyas, is said to have
obtained brides by this method. svayamvara was normally concluded
by performance of rites of religious marriage, and later legal
commentators maintain that no form of marriage is complete without the
religious ceremony, at least in an abridged form.

[Page 170] With long marriage ceremony completed householder
might devote himself to three ends of life, classification commonly
found in both religious and general literature. three are: dharma,
gaining religious merit through following Sacred Law; artha, gaining
wealth by honest means; and kama, pleasure of all kinds. three were of
descending order of importance, and it was thought that where interests
of one end conflicted with those of another higher should hv priority.

The two latter ends need little explanation, but for high class Indian the
first involved numerous religious duties, notably performance of birth,
marriage, funeral, and other ceremonies, and regular carrying out of the
“Five Great Sacrifices” ( pañca-mahāyajña).

The greatness of these sacrifices lay not in their expense or complexity,
but in their importance. They were to be performed daily and consisted of:
(1) Brahmayajña, worship of Brahman, World-Spirit, by reciting
the Vedas.

(2) Pitṛ ryajña, worship of ancestors, by libations of water and
periodical sraddhas.

(3) Devayajña, worship of gods, by pouring ghee on sacred fire.

(4) Bhutayajna, worship of all things living, by scattering grain and
other food on threshold for animals, birds, and spirits.

(5) Puruṣayajña, worship of men, by showing dm hospitality.

Ideally five great sacrifices should be performed thrice day, at the
sandhyas, or periods of worship at sunrise, noon and sunset.



SEXUAL RELATIONS
Though learned brāhmaṇs who composed Smrti literature and
laid down canons of behaviour for Indian layman were puritanical in
many respects, they did not disparage physical love. Of three ends of
life third, pleasure, though less important than other two, was a
legitimate branch of human activity, for which provision had to be made in
the scheme of existence. In its broadest sense word kama means desire
of every kind and its fulfilment, but, like such English words as “desire”
and “passion”, it usually had sexual connotation. Of all legitimate
pleasures sexual pleasure was thought to be best.

The literature of Hindu India, both religious and secular, is full of sexual
allusions, sexual symbolism, and passages of frank eroticism. The
preoccupation with such themes increased in Middle Ages, when the
process of cosmic creation was figured as union of god [Page 171] and
goddess, and figures of closely embracing couples ( maithuna) were carved
on walls of temples. Some religious sects even introduced ritual
intercourse as part of their cult, and potent aid to salvation. But the
exaggerated sexual religiosity of later Middle Ages was only an
expression of vigorous sexuality which was to be found in Indian social
life at all times. Sexual activity was indeed positive religious duty-the
husband must hv intercourse with his wife within period of eight days at
the close of every menstruation.

The Indian passion for classification, though it did not result in the
emergence of experimental science, led to development of rather
pedantic schools on many aspects of human activity, including sexual
relations. On this topic number of textbooks survive, most important
and earliest of which is Kāmasūtra, attributed to sage Vatsyayana,
and written in early centuries of Christian era, or perhaps in the
Gupta period. This remarkable work gives, as may be imagined, detailed
instructions on erotic technique, aphrodisiac recipes and charms, and much
very valuable information about life of ancient Indian. From texts
such as this, and from many passages in courtly literature, we may learn
much about sexual life of upper classes.

Sexuality was not looked on as mere vent for animal passions of the
male, but as refined mutual relationship for satisfaction of both
parties. sophisticated townsman for whom Kāmasūtra was written
was advised to consider satisfaction of his mistress as well as his own,
for she was as passionate as himself, and it was even said by some that her
pleasure in sex was greater than his. Loveplay was manifold and thoroughly
classified; thus Kāmasūtra defines no less than sixteen types of kiss.

There was much tenderness in lovemaking, though it often culminated in
very violent embraces; it was favourite poetic convention to describe
lovers of both sexes, whether married or single, as displaying tokens of
their passion to their confidential friends, in form of marks of nails
and teeth.

The erotic preoccupations of ancient India r made very evident in art
and literature. ideal of feminine beauty in ancient India differed very
greatly from matronly type of Greeks, or slender more boyish
type of modern Europe and America. Indian ideal, thick-thighed, broad
hipped, but very slender-waisted, and with heavy breasts, seems evidently
chosen for physical satisfaction. poets loved to describe their heroines
in terms of luxurious frankness. They did, however, observe certain
conventional restraints. preliminaries of sexual intercourse r treated,
and it is recollected in tranquillity in general terms, but act itself is
rarely if [Page 172] ever described in detail until very late period.

Detailed descriptions occur in vernacular poetry, but poets of India’s
greatness preferred to leave something at least unsaid.

As an example of better side of Indian sexual life we quote from the
Kāmasūtra:
“For first three days after their marriage husband and wife
should sleep on floor and abstain from intercourse…. For next
seven days they should bathe to sound of music, adorn themselves,
dine together, and pay their respects to their relatives and to other
people who attended their wedding…. On evening of tenth day
the husband should speak gently to his wife… to give her
confidence…. Vatsyayana recommends that man should at first
refrain from intercourse, until he has won over his bride and gained her
confidence, for women, being gentle by nature, prefer to be won over
gently. If woman is forced to submit to rough handling from man
whom she scarcely knows she may come to hate sexual intercourse,
and even to hate whole male sex… or she may grow to detest her
husband in particular, and will then turn to another man.”35

Vatsyayana then gives detailed example of courtship of newly
married bride by her husband, which would win approval of most
modern psychologists.

The erotic life of ancient India was generally heterosexual.

Homosexualism of both sexes was not wholly unknown; it is condemned
briefly in lawbooks, and Kāmasūtra treats of it, but cursorily, and
with little enthusiasm. Literature ignores it. In this respect ancient India was
far healthier than most other ancient cultures. Another unpleasant feature of
ancient civilizations, eunuch, was also rare, though not completely
unknown. Castration, whether of men or animals, was disapproved of, and
harems were generally guarded by elderly men and armed women.



DIVORCE
From point of view of Sacred Law marriage was indissoluble,
once seven steps had been taken together. Even if not consummated it
could not be annulled, and divorce was quite impossible. An errant wife lost
most of her rights, but her husband was still responsible for her bare
maintenance if it was demanded, and she was not entitled to remarry. The
lawbooks vary in their attitude to adulterous wife; generally if she had
wilful intercourse with man of base caste her lot was hard; Manu36 and
some other sources even lay down that she should be torn apart by dogs.

But [Page 173] adulteress who strayed with man of higher caste was
more fortunate; most authorities agree that she should be made to wear dirty
clothes, sleep on ground, and eat only enough food barely to sustain life,
until her next menstruation; thereafter she might be restored to her
husband’s bed and her old position in household.

Though religious lawbooks leave no room for divorce, the
Arthaśāstra37 shows that it was possible in early times, at least in marriages
not solemnized by religious rites. In this case divorce was allowed by
mutual consent on grounds of incompatibility, and one party might obtain
divorce without consent of other if apprehensive of actual physical
danger from his or her partner. Arthaśāstra would allow divorce even
after religious marriage to wife who has been deserted by her husband,
and lays down waiting periods of from one to twelve years, which vary
according to circumstances and class.38 These provisions, however, do not
appear in later lawbooks, and were probably forgotten by Gupta times,
when divorce became virtually impossible for people of higher classes.

Among many lower castes, however, divorce is still permitted by custom,
and this must also hv been case in earlier days.



POLYGAMY
The ordinary people of India, as of every other part of world, were
generally monogamous, though even in time of Ṛ g Veda polygamy
was not unknown. Kings and chiefs were almost invariably polygamous, as
were many brāhmaṇs and wealthier members of lower orders.

Polygamy, in ordinary circumstances, was not encouraged by earlier
legal literature. One Dharma Sūtra39 definitely forbids man to take a
second wife if his first is of good character and has borne him sons. Another
later source states that polygamist is unfit to testify in court of law.40
The Arthaśāstra 41 lays down various rules which discourage wanton
polygamy, including payment of compensation to first wife. The
ideal models of Hindu marriage r hero Rama and his faithful wife
Sita, whose mutual love was never broken by rivalry of co-wife.

However, polygamous marriages r so frequently mentioned that we may
assume that they were fairly common among all sections of community
who could afford them.

A husband was told to treat his wives alike, but this was rule which
could hardly be enforced by law and which was usually psychological
impossibility. Tied to her husband’s home, first wife often felt bitterly
the happiness of her rival.

[Page 174] “Grief of man who loses all his wealth,
and of him whose son is slain;
grief of wife who has lost her lord,
and of him whom king has made captive;
grief of childless woman,
and of him who feels breath of tiger at his back;
grief of wife whose husband has married another woman,
and of one convicted by witnesses in court—
these griefs r all alike.”42
Several of courtly dramas deal with jealousy of king’s senior
wife towards latest object of her lord’s affections, but they invariably
end on happy note, with acceptance by old queen of her younger
rival. Polygamous households were not necessarily unhappy, and first
wife might console herself, if she had male children, with knowledge
that she was chief wife, mistress of household, entitled to the
first place beside her husband at family rites.

If polygamy was common, its reverse, polyandry, was not wholly
unknown, though it was impossible for ordinary people of respectable class
in most parts of India. “For brother to take wife of brother,” writes one
legal text, “is great sin, though in other lands it is even known to marry a
girl to an entire family”.43 locus classicus of ancient Indian polyandry
is Mahabharata, where heroes, five Pandava brothers, shared
their wife, Draupadi, in common. Lawyers were hard put to it to explain
this abnormal matrimonial arrangement, but it is well known among the
Mongolian hill tribes to this day, and also among certain low castes in the
Deccan. There r few other references to polyandry here and there in
Indian literature.

Among Nayyars of Malabar practice prevailed until comparatively
recent times, no doubt survival of remote antiquity, which was different
from group marriage of Himalayan tribes, and was connected with
the local matrilinear family system. girl was married, as sop to Āryan
convention, to man hired for purpose; marriage was not
consummated and she might never see her husband again. She remained in
the family home, and fact of her marriage was published; when it
became known, she was courted by eligible men of neighbourhood,
from whom she chose her true husband, often Nambūidiri brāhmaṇ, who
was accepted without ceremony. children of union took their
mother’s name, and inheritance passed through her line, though the
eldest male of family acted as head of house. husband had no
rights over his wife’s family at all, and might take less interest in his
children [Page 175] than did their maternal uncle. He might be discarded by
the mother of his children and replaced by another suitor, though real
promiscuity on her part was frowned upon. Malabār system of
marumakkattāyam shows that pattern of matrimonial relations had more
variety than allowed by legal texts.

In his efforts to produce son man might without slur on his character
take second wife, if his first was barren, and so on indefinitely; indeed in
these circumstances polygamy was religious duty. If husband was
sterile or impotent he had to take further measures. In last resort he
would appoint close relative, usually brother, to produce offspring on his
behalf. From several stories in Epics and elsewhere it appears that holy
men of special sanctity were also often in demand for this purpose, and
practices of this kind r said to take place occasionally even at present
day.

Similarly, if husband died without producing male issue his brother
might act on his behalf. This practice of levirate ( niyoga) was well known
in many ancient societies, and references to it r common in early Indian
legal literature. Before beginning of Christian era, however, it began
to be disapproved of, and medieval writers include it among now
forbidden kalivarjya customs, which were permitted in earlier ages.



OLD AGE AND DEATH
According to letter of Sacred Law, when householder’s hair
turns white, and he sees his sons’ sons, he should become hermit, either
leaving his wife to care of his children or taking her to forest with
him. There, living in little hut on alms of villagers or food collected
from wilds, he should perform regular rites at his sacred fire and study
the Upanisads, in order to raise his soul above earthly things. He may add to
his hardships by deliberate selfmortification. “In summer he should sit
exposed to heat of five fires, in rainy season he should live under the
sky, in winter he should wear wet clothes, and so he should gradually
augment his hardships.”44 This is stage of life of vānaprastha, the
forest hermit.

Before death there is yet another stage through which to pass. When all
last attachments to worldly things hv passed away hermit may leave
his forest retreat, give up performance of all ceremonies, and become a
homeless wanderer ( sannyasin), with nothing but staff, begging bowl,
and few rags of clothing:
“He should not wish to die,
nor hope to live,
but await time appointed,
as servant awaits his wages….

[Page 176] “He must show no anger
to one who is angry.

He must bless man who curses him…
He must not utter false speech.

“Rejoicing in things of spirit, calm,
caring for nothing, abstaining from sensual pleasure,
himself his only helper,
he may live on in world, in hope of eternal bliss.”45
We must not imagine that more than small proportion of elderly men
followed these drastic means of achieving salvation. For ordinary man
the status of householder was enough, and he was content with hope of
a long period of conditioned bliss in heaven, followed by another happy
birth on earth-the fate assured to householder who fully maintained the
rites and ethics of Āryan. But number of elderly men who took up
asceticism was considerable, and desire of adult and married sons to
obtain control of family property no doubt encouraged asceticism of
their parents. Even today it is not unusual for an elderly man to follow the
course laid down by ancient sages, and to end his days in asceticism,
though nowadays his hermitage may be hut in family compound, or a
secluded room in his old home.

As man was born in impurity so he died in impurity. Nearly all ancient
peoples had horror of contact with corpse, and India was no exception.

No doubt idea of ritual impurity originated in very primitive belief in
demons, but it survived in advanced civilization of classical India, when
its basis was no longer properly recognized. acc to Sacred Law
mourners must avoid all close contact with outsiders for fear of carrying
pollution; they must submit to rigid dietary restrictions, and sleep on the
ground; they must not shave their hair, or worship gods. caṇḍālas,
who had duty of laying out and shrouding body and carrying it to the
cremation ground, were most inauspicious of creatures, and lowest
of low.

The funeral ceremonies ( antyesti) were last of many sacraments
which marked stages of man’s life. acc to most favoured
Āryan custom corpse was carried to burning ground as soon as
possible after death, followed by mourners, eldest leading; it was
cremated, to accompaniment of sacred texts; mourners
circumambulated pyre, not in auspicious clockwise direction, but
anti-clockwise; then they bathed in nearest river, tank or lake, and
returned home, this time led by youngest. [Page 177] On third day
after cremation charred bones of dead were gathered up and
thrown into river, preferably Ganges.

For ten days after cremation libations of water were poured for the
dead, and offerings of rice-balls ( piṇḍ a) and vessels of milk were made for
him. On death man’s soul became miserable ghost ( preta), unable to
pass on to World of Fathers or to new birth, and liable to do harm
to surviving relatives. With performance of last antyesti rite on
the tenth day it acquired subtle body with which to continue its journey,
speeded on its way and nourished in after-life with pindas offered at
periodical sraddha ceremonies. With tenth day, mourners ceased to
be impure, and resumed their normal lives.

This funeral ceremony was that followed by upper classes in ancient
India, and is no different from that of present-day Hinduism. There were
other funeral customs, however. Harappā people buried their dead,
while early Āryans did not throw charred remains into river, but
buried them, in case of important people under large barrow. Small
children, whose bodies do not carry same impurity as those of their
elders and who r not full members of Āryan community, r still often
buried, as r ascetics and members of some low castes in South India.

These customs hv probably survived from very early days. In most
literary references śmaśāna, or cremation ground, is described as
covered with putrefying corpses, and haunted by dogs and vultures, rather
than as scene of cremation. descriptions of such places show that
many people in ancient India did not cremate their dead, but, like the
Zoroastrians of Persia, merely abandoned their bodies to wild beasts. No
doubt economic considerations played big part in this practice, especially
in those parts of country where timber was scarce; even to this day the
poorer Indians must be content with an exiguous funeral pyre, and their
corpses r often not completely burnt.



WOMEN
A woman, acc to most authorities, was always minor at law. As a
girl she was under tutelage of her parents, as an adult, of her husband,
and as widow, of her sons. Even under liberal rules of Buddhism a
nun, however advanced in faith, was always subordinate to youngest
novice among brethren. Early lawbooks assess woman’s wergeld as
equivalent to that of śūdra, whatever her class.

Most schools of law allowed woman some personal property [Page
178] ( stridhana) in form of jewellery and clothing. Arthaśāstra
allowed her also to own money up to 2,000 silver panas, any sum above this
being held by her husband in trust on her behalf.41 husband had certain
rights over his wife’s property; he might sell it in dire emergency, and he
might restrain her from giving it away wantonly, but for practical purposes
it was her own, and when she died it passed not to her husband or to her
sons, but to her daughters. Thus property rights of women, limited
though they were, were greater than in many other early civilizations. In
fact women sometimes possessed more than was usually allowed to them
by rules of stridhana. Jaina tradition mentions potter-woman of the
town of Śrāvastī who owned pottery with one hundred potter’s wheels.

Her status is nowhere mentioned, and it may be that she was thought of as a
widow, for we hv seen that some legal schools allowed widow to inherit
when there were no sons.

Women could at all times take up life of religion, though of course they
could not officiate as priests. few Vedic hymns r ascribed to women
seers, and among voluminous Buddhist scriptures is whole collection
of poems ascribed to nuns of early church, many of which r of
great literary merit (p. 456). Brhadāraṇ yaka Upaniṣ ad 46 tells of a
learned lady, Gargi Vacaknavi, who attended discussions of sage
Yājñavalkya, and for time so nonplussed him with her searching questions
that he could only jestingly reply, “Gargi, you mustn’t ask too much, or
your head will drop off!” References occur here and there in later texts to
girls occasionally attending lectures of gurus, and mastering at least part
of Vedas. By time of Smrtis, however, around beginning of
the Christian era, Vedic knowledge was closed to women, although the
heterodox sects still catered for them. tantric sects of Middle Ages,
who worshipped feminine divinities, gave women an important place in
their cult and instituted orders of female ascetics.

In general, however, women were not encouraged to take up life of
religion or asceticism. Their true function was marriage, and care of
their menfolk and children. But better class laywomen seem to have
been educated, and there r several references to works of Sanskrit poetry
and drama by women authors, of which some fragments survive. In Tamil
the early poetess Avvaiyar has left work of great merit, and splendid
martial ode describing great victory of early Cōla king Karikalan at
Veṇṇi is ascribed to an unnamed potter’s wife. 47 ladies of Sanskrit
courtly literature r often described as reading, writing, and composing
songs, and they seem to hv been well versed in arts of time.

Though from [Page 179] medieval times until very recent years arts of
music and dancing were looked on as quite unfit for respectable Indian
girls, and were practised only by low-caste women and prostitutes, this was
not case in ancient days, when well-to-do girls were taught singing and
dancing, as well as other ladylike arts such as painting and garlandmaking.

In Muslim times Hindus of Northern India adopted system of
parda, by which, from puberty to old age, women were carefully screened
from sight of all men but their husbands and close relatives. Though
such system did not exist in ancient India freedom accorded to married
women has been often exaggerated by authorities anxious to show that the
more objectionable aspects of later Hindu custom had no place in India’s
ancient culture. Certainly Ṛ g Veda depicts young men and unmarried
girls mixing freely, and gives no evidence that married women were in any
way secluded, but this text belongs to time which had long passed in the
great days of Hindu culture. Kings, at any rate, kept their womenfolk in
seclusion. detailed instructions of Arthaśāstra make it quite clear
that antahpura, or royal harem, was closely guarded, and that its
inmates were not allowed to leave it freely. It was certainly not so strictly
secluded as in later Muslim communities, however, for early Arab travellers
remarked that queens were often to be seen in Hindu courts without veils,
and many other references show that, though screened from general
public and carefully watched, royal ladies were not completely
inaccessible, as in Muslim system.

The women of upper classes were kept at distance from opposite
sex. Arthaśāstra, 37 in many ways more liberal than religious
lawbooks, lays down quite stringent rules for punishment of immodest
wives. woman who insolently takes part in games, or drinks, against her
husband’s wishes, is to be fined three paṇas. If she leaves her home without
his permission to visit another woman she is to be fined six paṇas; if she
visits man fine is twelve; while if she goes on such errands by night
the fine is doubled. If she leaves house while her husband is asleep or
drunk she is to be fined twelve paṇas. If woman and man make gestures
of sexual import to one another, or converse facetiously in secret, the
woman is to be fined twenty-four paṇas and man twice that sum. If their
conversation takes place in suspicious place, lashes may be substituted for
paṇas and “in village square caṇḍāla shall give her five lashes on
each side of body”. Thus husband had almost unlimited rights over
his wife’s movements.

Elsewhere Arthaśāstra gives evidence of different kind to show that
even in Mauryan times freedom of high-class women [Page 180] was
considerably restricted by custom. In instructions to king’s
Superintendent of Weaving we r told that staff of royal weaving
and spinning establishments should be made up of indigent women-a
motley collection, including widows, cripples, orphans, beggar-women,
women who had failed to pay fines and were compelled to work dm off,
and broken-down prostitutes. These were all of low class, and worked under
male overseers.48
It might happen that sometimes better-class woman fell on evil days,
and was compelled to earn living in this way. She was catered for,
however, in different manner. If she could still maintain maid, maid
might fetch yarn from weaving shop, and bring it back in form
of cloth; but if lady was compelled to fetch and deliver her own material
stringent precautions were laid down so that her modesty should in no way
be offended. She was to go to weaving shop in dim light of dawn,
when she would not be easily seen. official who received her work
should only use lamp to examine its workmanship; if he looked her in the
face, or spoke to her about anything other than her work, he incurred the
fine known as “the first amercement”, from forty-eight to ninety paṇas. It is
evident from these instructions that upper-class women, though their faces
were unveiled, were not normally seen in public without their menfolk.

There were certainly wide differences of custom however. Girls of good
class and marriageable age r described in story as visiting temples and
taking part in festivals without guardian or chaperone. Early Tamil
literature, more popular in character than that of Āryan North, makes
many references to free association of young men and women. Early
sculpture gives same impression. At Bharhut and Sānchū wealthy
ladies, naked to waist, lean from their balconies to watch processions,
and scantily dressed women in company of men worship Bodhi
Tree, under which Buddha gained enlightenment. We may conclude
that, while woman’s freedom was generally much restricted, it was rarely
completely taken away.

A wife, however, had little initiative. Her first duty was to wait on her
husband, fetching and carrying for him, rubbing his feet when he was
weary, rising before him, and eating and sleeping after him.

“She should do nothing independently
even in her own house.

In childhood subject to her father,
in youth to her husband,
and when her husband is dead to her sons,
she should never enjoy independence….

[Page 181] “She should always be cheerful,
and skilful in her domestic duties,
with her household vessels well cleansed,
and her hand tight on purse-strings….

“In season and out of season
her lord, who wed her with sacred rites,
ever gives happiness to his wife,
both here and in other world.

“Though he be uncouth and prone to pleasure,
though he hv no good points at all,
the virtuous wife should ever
worship her lord as god.”49
Passages of this type r frequent in literature of religious and semi-
religious type, and stories of obedient and faithful wives r numerous. The
great models of Indian womanhood r Sita, who faithfully followed her
husband Rama into exile and endured great hardships and temptations for
his sake (p. 412f), and Savitrl, who, like Greek Alcestis, followed her
husband Satyavant when he was being carried away by death-god
Yama, and so impressed god with her loyalty that he released her lord.

A medieval tale gives an even more striking example of wifely fidelity:
A woman was holding her sleeping husband’s head in her lap, as
they and their child warmed themselves in winter before blazing fire.

Suddenly child crawled towards fire, but woman made no
attempt to save it from flames, since thus she would wake her lord.

As baby crawled further into flames she prayed to fire-god
Agni not to hurt him. god, impressed by her obedience, granted
her prayer, and child sat smiling and unharmed in middle of the
fire until man awoke.50
Though early Indian mind, prone to exaggeration, perhaps overdid
the necessity of wifely obedience, her status was not without honour.

“The wife is half man,
the best of friends,
the root of three ends of life,
and of all that will help him in other world.

“With wife man does mighty deeds…
With wife man finds courage.

A wife is safest refuge….

[Page 182] “A man aflame with sorrow in his soul,
or sick with disease, finds comfort in his wife,
as man parched with heat
finds relief in water.

“Even man in grip of rage
will not be harsh to woman,
remembering that on her depend
the joys of love, happiness, and virtue.

“For woman is everlasting field,
in which Self is born.” 51
Passages like these, showing honour and esteem in which women were
held, r quite as numerous as those which stress their subservience.

Everywhere it is stated that woman should be lovingly cherished, well fed
and cared for, and provided with jewellery and luxuries to limits of her
husband’s means. She should never be upbraided too severely, for gods
will not accept sacrifice of man who beats his wife. ancient
Indian attitude to women was in fact ambivalent. She was at once goddess
and slave, saint and strumpet.

The latter aspect of her character is frequently brought out in
semireligious and gnomic literature. Women’s lust knows no bounds:
“The fire has never too many logs,
the ocean never too many rivers,
death never too many living souls,
and fair-eyed woman never too many men.”52
No one man cn satisfy libidinous woman’s cravings; unless constantly
watched she will consort with every stranger, even with hunchback, a
dwarf or cripple (p. 443), and in last resort will hv recourse to
Lesbian practices with members of her own sex. Her deception is as all-
embracing as her lust, and she is incorrigibly fickle.

Moreover, women r quarrelsome and given to pique. They quarrel with
one another, with their parents, and with their husbands. henpecked
husband, as we show elsewhere (p. 459f), was wellknown in ancient India.

Many verses in medieval anthologies depict emotion of māna, an
untranslatable word implying mixture of anger, wounded pride and
jealousy. Early Tamil literature contains whole class of poems describing
the efforts of husband to calm his wife’s anger, roused by his attentions
to rival, usually prostitute. If Sita, heroine of Rāmāyaṇ a, is
invariably meek and [Page 183] compliant before her lord, Draupadī of the
Mahābhārata cn round on her five husbands and reproach dm in no
uncertain terms. Mauryan kings were guarded by amazons trained in
the use of sword and bow, and Greeks were impressed by ferocity
with which women of some of Panjāb tribes aided their menfolk in
resisting Alexander. In later times women sometimes took part in war (p.

91), and tradition was continued among Rajputs until quite recently;
there r numerous records of masterly and warlike widows resisting the
enemies of their husbands-the last being famous Rānā of Jhānsū, whose
part in Indian Mutiny has made her national heroine of modern India.



PROSTITUTION
Ancient India contained one class of women who were not bound by the
rules and restrictions which limited freedom of highcaste wife.

These were prostitutes ( veśyā, gaṇ ikā). There were certainly many poor
and cheap prostitutes, who would end their days in beggary, or as menials
and work-women; but typical prostitute of literature was beautiful,
accomplished, and wealthy, enjoying position of fame and honour
comparable to that of Aspasias and Phrynes of classical Greece.

As in Greece higher class hetaira was an educated woman. The
authorities on erotics demand that, as well as in art immediately
essential to her profession, she should be thoroughly trained in “the sixty-
four arts”. These were stock list, which included not only music, dancing
and singing, but also acting, composition of poetry, impromptu and
otherwise, flower-arrangement and garland-making, preparation of
perfumes and cosmetics, cooking, dress-making and embroidery, sorcery,
conjuring and sleight of hand, composition of riddles, tongue-twisters
and other puzzles, fencing with sword and staff, archery, gymnastics,
carpentry and architecture, logic, chemistry and mineralogy, gardening,
training fighting cocks, partridges and rams, teaching parrots and mynahs to
talk, writing in cipher, languages, making artificial flowers, and clay
modelling.

It is hardly likely that prostitute did in fact study all arts of this
rather bizarre list, but it shows what was expected of her. If she mastered
those arts most suited to her profession brilliant future awaited her. “A
courtesan of pleasant disposition, beautiful, and otherwise attractive, who
has mastered arts… has right to seat of honour among men. She
will be honoured by king and praised by learned, and all will seek
her favours and treat her [Page 184] with consideration.”53 literature of
the Middle Ages fully bears out this statement.

Typical of such accomplished courtesans was Ambapālī, hetaira of
Vaiśālū, famous in Buddhist legend. Much that is said of this lady is
certainly legendary, but it gives significant indication of status of the
better type of courtesan in ancient India. Ambapall was immensely wealthy,
highly intelligent, and famous throughout civilized portion of India. She
was one of most treasured possessions of her city, and mixed on equal
terms with princes. On his last journey to Hills, as he passed through
Vaisali, Buddha accepted her invitation to dine in preference to that of
the city fathers, who wished to give him civic reception. Ambapālī is said
to hv become Buddhist nun, and one of most beautiful poems of the
Pali canon is attributed to her (p. 456).

The prostitute was protected and supervised by state. The
Arthaśāstra54 suggests appointment of Superintendent of Prostitutes
who should be responsible for care and supervision of palace
courtesans, inspection of brothels, and collection of two days’
earnings from each prostitute every month, as tax to government.

Teachers and trainers of prostitutes were to be given encouragement by the
state. As in all other societies, around prostitute congregated men of
doubtful character, either outside law or on its borderline-thieves,
rogues, pseudo-magicians, and confidence tricksters of all kinds. texts
on statecraft recommend that for this reason special watch should be kept
on brothels and that prostitutes should be enlisted in secret service. This
fact was noted by Megasthenes, who remarked that spies did much of
their work with help of prostitutes. From example of play “The
Little Clay Cart” it would seem that prostitute might become an honest
woman by marriage, for here heroine, high-souled courtesan
Vasantasena, ultimately becomes second wife of brāhmaṇ hero
Carudatta.

The position of courtesan merged with that of concubine. Kings
and chiefs retained numerous prostitutes in their palaces, who were salaried
servants, and who often had other duties to perform, such as attending on
the king’s person. status of these women is somewhat obscure, but
apparently they were not only at service of king, but also of any
courtier on whom he might choose temporarily to bestow them, and thus
they were not on par with regular inhabitants of his harem. Prostitutes
of this type accompanied king wherever he went, and even awaited him
in rear when he went into battle.


Another type of prostitute pursued her trade in an odour of [Page 185]
sanctity. In Middle Ages god in his temple was treated like an
earthly king; he had his wives, his ministers and attendants, and all the
paraphernalia of court-including his attendant prostitutes. These were
often children of mothers of same profession, born and reared in the
temple precincts, but they might be daughters of ordinary citizens, given in
childhood to god as pious offerings. They attended on god’s person,
danced and sang before him, and, like servants of an earthly king,
bestowed their favours on courtiers whom he favoured, in this case the
male worshippers who paid their fee to temple.

PLATE XLIV
We hv no evidence of temple prostitution in very early times, though it
certainly existed in other ancient civilizations, and it has been suggested,
without valid evidence in our opinion, that it was known in prehistoric
Indus cities (p. 21). earliest record of religious prostitution comes from
a cave at Ramgarh, in Vindhya hills some 160 miles south of Banaras,
which contains two significant Prakrit inscriptions in script which shows
that they were written not long after days of Aśoka. first of these is
in verse:
“Poets, leaders of lovers,
light up hearts which r heavy with passion.

She who rides on seesaw, object of jest and blame,
how cn she hv fallen so deep in love as this?”
And then, in prose:
“The excellent young man Devadinna painter loved Sutanuka, the
slave-girl of god.” 55
The enamoured Sutanuka is referred to by word later regularly used
for temple prostitute— devadasi—and was evidently something of the
kind herself. There r no other clear references to devadāsīs in early
sources, however, and we must assume that they were rare until Middle
Ages. Temple prostitution was most common in South, where it
survived until recent times. wild fertility cults of early Tamils
involved orgiastic dancing, and their earliest literature shows that
prostitution was common among them; thus religious prostitution came
naturally to Dravidian. Many inscriptions and charters of medieval
South commemorating donations to temples refer specially to devadāsīs; for
instance general of Vikramaditya VI Cālukya, named Mahādeva, is
recorded as founding temple in memory of his late mother, with quarters
for most beautiful temple-prostitutes in country. 56 In his eyes, and in
those of his contemporaries, there was no incongruity in such memorial.

Prostitution, though in many contexts honoured and respected, [Page
186] was much disapproved of by Smrti writers, whose works contain
passages of warning against evils of prostitution reminiscent of those in
the Jewish Book of Proverbs. Manu and some other texts class harlot
and gambler with thief and blackmailer, and declare that brāhmaṇs must
never consort with prostitutes, on pain of very heavy penances. One source
even maintains that murderer of prostitute commits no sin and should
incur no punishment at law. 57 But, as we hv noticed in many other cases,
the secular attitude differed very greatly from religious ideal, and here it
was secular view which prevailed. By Middle Ages brāhmaṇs
who propounded the. Sacred Law might themselves be attached to temples
with hundreds of prostitutes on their staffs.



WIDOWS
In general widow could not remarry. By medieval times this rule was
applied so strictly in upper classes that it included even girls widowed in
childhood, whose marriages had not been consummated. Even custom
of niyoga, which gave childless widow chance to conceive son by
her brother-in-law (p. 175), passed into desuetude in early centuries of
the Christian era.

All evidence shows, however, that remarriage of widows was fairly
common in earlier times. Arthaśāstra admits its possibility. In the
famous old story of Nala and Damayanti, hero, who has long been
parted from his wife, is reunited with her by subterfuge of her
announcement that she presumes his death and plans to hold second
svayaṃvara. One or two minor authorities admit possibility of a
woman’s remarriage if her husband disappears, dies, becomes an ascetic, is
impotent, or loses caste;58 but later commentators explain away these
awkward references by easy fiction of kalivarjya (p. 148), and all agree
with Manu: ‘nowhere is second husband permitted to respectable
women”.59 Thus practice of widow remarriage, together with many
other healthy old customs, gradually disappeared among higher classes.

In those families which adhered to letter of law lot of the
widow was very hard. She was to all intents and purposes an ascetic,
sleeping on ground, and eating only one simple meal day, without
honey, meat, wine or salt, wearing no ornaments or coloured garments, and
using no perfumes. In medieval times widows were also expected to shave
their hair. widow had to maintain this austere regimen to end of her
days, in hope of being remarried to her former husband in next life;
her time was spent in prayer and other religious rites on his behalf, and any
breach [Page 187] of her ascetic discipline not only made her liable to a
very unhappy rebirth, but also endangered welfare of soul of her
departed husband, who might suffer in after-life for shortcomings of
his other half on earth.

Moreover widow was inauspicious to everyone but her own children.

Wherever she went her presence cast gloom on all about her. She could
never attend family festivals which played so big part in Hindu life,
for she would bring bad luck on all present. She was still member of her
husband’s family, and could not return to that of her parents. Always
watched by parents and relatives of her lord, lest she broke her vows
and imperilled dead man’s spiritual welfare, shunned as unlucky even
by servants, her life must often hv been miserable in extreme.

In these circumstances it is not surprising that women often immolated
themselves on their husbands’ funeral pyres, practice noticed with much
disapprobation by European travellers and only put down in last
century. word sati (written suttee by older English writers) means “a
virtuous woman”, and word was erroneously applied by early officials
and missionaries to satī’s self-immolation.

The history of custom takes us back to earliest cultures. Many
ancient peoples buried or burnt man’s widows, horses, and other cherished
possessions with his corpse, in order that he might hv all that he loved
and needed in other world. We know that such practices were followed
by kings of Ur, and also by ancient Chinese and some early Indo-
European peoples. One of funeral hymns of Ṛ g Veda shows that in
the earliest form of cremation rite known to us widow lay down
beside dead man, and his bow was placed in his hand; bow was
removed, and wife called on to return to land of living. 60 This
practice must look back to time long before composition of hymn,
when wife was actually burnt with her husband.

The earliest datable notice of self-immolation of sati occurs in
Greek accounts of Alexander’s invasion. One or two cases r mentioned in
the Epics, but rarely enough to show that custom was uncommon at the
time of their composition. Early Smrti literature allows it, but in general
does not strongly emphasise it. first memorial of sati is found at Eran,
near Saugor in Madhya Pradesh, where brief inscription engraved on a
pillar in A.D. 510 records tragic passing of hero and his wife in short
verses of un-Indian simplicity, which suggest epitaphs of Greek
Anthology:
[Page 188] “Hither came Bhānu Gupta, bravest man on earth,
a great king, hero bold as Arjuna;
and hither Goparaja followed him,
as friend follows friend.

“And he fought great and famous battle,
and passed to heaven, god among chieftains.

His wife, loyal and loving, beloved and fair,
followed close behind him into flames.” 61
It is known that nomads of Central Asia practised this custom, and it
may hv received some stimulus from their invasions. In any case, from
this time onwards it became more common, and there r numerous satī-
stones all over India, commemorating many faithful wives who
followed their slain lords in death.

Criticisms of custom were not unknown. It was condemned by the
humane poet Bana, in 7th century, and by tantric sects, which even
declared that woman burning herself on her husband’s pyre went
straight to hell. But some medieval writers roundly declare that satī, by
her self-immolation, expunges both her own and her husband’s sins, and
that two enjoy together 35 million years of bliss in heaven.

The living cremation of sati was always in theory voluntary, but, if
we r to judge from later analogy, social and family pressure may have
made it virtually obligatory on some high-caste widows, especially those of
the warrior class. 15th-century traveller Nicolo dei Conti states that as
many as three thousand of wives and concubines of kings of
Vijayanagara were pledged to be burnt with their lord on his death. 6
The widow was, as we hv seen, an inauspicious encumbrance to her
husband’s family, and might seriously endanger welfare of his soul by
the least breach of her vows. In polygamous household objection to
widows would be correspondingly multiplied. widow herself, if she
had no young children, might well prefer even painful death, in hope
of reunion with her husband, to dreary life of hunger, scorn, and domestic
servitude. It is thus not surprising that satīs were so common in medieval
Hindu society.

2 This term was extended to mean family priest, who performed the
many rites and ceremonies of Hinduism for family or group of families,
and has survived in this sense to present day.

EVERYDAY LIFE: DAILY ROUND IN
CITY AND VILLAGE


THE VILLAGE
[Page 189]
WE hv no certain means of assessing population of ancient India,
since detailed registers which were kept in many kingdoms hv long
since vanished. One authority has suggested that during medieval period
the total population of Sub-continent was between 100 and 140
millions, 1 figure which seems reasonable, although based on very slender
evidence. But whatever India’s population in ancient and medieval times, it
was certainly mainly rural. At present day it is said that 85 per cent of
India’s total population dwell in villages, and we may be sure that the
proportion in past was no less, but probably more. average man in
ancient India was countryman.


Fig. xii.-A village (from relief at Amarāvatī. c. 2nd century A.D.)

No one who has travelled from Delhi to Calcutta by train could fail to be
impressed by monotony of great Gangetic Plain. shabby little
villages, often very close together, r punctuated only by rivers and canals.

They hv few trees on their outskirts, [Page 190] and here and there a
small grove divides one from another. Otherwise there is nothing to be seen
between villages but little fields separated by narrow footpaths and
occasional rough roads. But this was not case in ancient times.

Even when first Englishmen set up their trading stations in Madras,
Bombay and Calcutta there were more trees in countryside; and in the
earlier period India was much better afforested. Hsüan Tsang’s account of
India shows that, in 7th century, dense jungle lined banks of the
Ganges for many miles on end. countryside was wilder than it is today.

The tiger, now rare except in certain districts, roamed length and
breadth of land. In West lion, now almost extinct, was common.

Herds of wild elephants, carefully preserved by kings, were numerous in
regions where they r now unknown. foothills of Vindhyas and the
Ghats, now in many places almost denuded of larger trees by centuries of
woodcutting and many generations of browsing goats, were richly forested.

In fact age-old agricultural techniques of India had not yet exhausted
her soil, and her peasants had not yet torn up her forests, though in some
places, notably Magadha (South Bihār) and parts of Tamil country, this
process was almost complete by Middle Ages, if not before.

The Indian village differed very little from that of present day, but
while most villages in North r now open and undefended, in earlier
times they were usually walled or stockaded, as they r still in many parts
of Deccan. village was cluster of huts, small and large, often
grouped round well or pond, near which was small open space with a
few trees. In earlier times villages often had clubrooms, which served as
rest-houses for travellers and as centres of social life; later place of these
halls was taken by village temples. villagers formed self-
conscious community, and often had an energetic communal life. We quote
from Jātaka story.

“One day they stood in middle of village to transact village
business, and they. … [decided to] do good works; so they would get
up betimes, and go out with knives, axes and crowbars. With their
crowbars they rolled away stones on four highways; they cut
down trees which caught axles of their carts; they levelled the
irregularities [of roads]; they built an embankment and dug tanks;

they made village hall; they showed charity and kept [Buddhist]
commandments.”2
This vigorous corporate life continued into Middle Ages. Tamil
inscriptions show that village councils (p. 106) took an active interest in
the communal welfare, dug and renewed reservoirs, made [Page 191]
canals, improved roads, and cared for village shrines. This strong
sense of community was one of chief factors in survival of
Hindu Culture.

Most of villagers were free peasants, and their land was to all intents
and purposes their own, though king claimed its ultimate ownership (p.

109f). lot of peasant was hard, though perhaps poverty was not so
grinding as it later became, and agricultural indebtedness was certainly less
heavy. Most peasant holdings were small, and were usually worked by the
owner and his family; but there were few large farmsteads, owners of
which cultivated their estates with hired labour. Kings too had large
demesnes, worked by serfs and labourers, who in Mauryan times received
one and one quarter paṇa per month with maintenance. 3 Other land was let
out by owners to share-croppers in return for one half of crop.


Fig. xiii.-Country scene (from terracotta plaque found at Bhītā, near Allahabad.? 1st century
B.C.)


These landless labourers existed in Indian village at least from
Mauryan times, and probably earlier, their state an unhappy and despised
one. Illness, famine, idleness, or some other cause would sometimes compel
a peasant to sell his holding, or result in his eviction for non-payment of
tax, and he would be reduced to shame and penury as casual labourer. But
this process, whereby land tended to become concentrated in hands of a
few landowners, was more than counteracted by Indian joint family
system. On death of head of house there was usually partition
of family lands, and thus few generations might see break-up of a
large [Page 192] estate. real class of squires or large farmers never
appeared in Hindu India.

To heavy taxation, forced labour, and visitations of king and his
officers, were added periodical dearths and famines to afflict and
impoverish peasant. Though Megasthenes declared that famine was
unknown in India, he certainly wrote in this particular from inadequate
knowledge. References to famine, with its attendant horrors, r fairly
common in ancient Indian literature (p. 443). Indeed great famine is said
to hv occurred not long after Megasthenes left India, at end of the
reign of Candragupta Maurya. more energetic and conscientious kings
did what they could to prevent and relieve famine. Arthaśāstra even
suggests that king is justified in confiscating hoarded wealth of his
subjects to feed hungry. state granaries would be opened in
emergency, and charity of religious establishments and private persons
was no doubt of some help; but with such poor communications famine was
even more severe than it is now. There is reason to believe that rainfall was
rather heavier than in recent years, and pressure of population on the
means of subsistence was not as great as it has now become. Hence
outbreaks of dearth and famine were probably less frequent in ancient days,
but when they did occur they caused even greater hardship and loss of life.

Throughout our period there was gradual expansion of cultivation as a
result of pressure on land. Arthaśāstra4 suggests positive policy
of colonization, clearing of waste, and development of new villages, while
the Jataka stories show us groups of hardy peasants from overpopulated
villages cutting new settlements from jungle, and even tell of whole
villages emigrating en masse to wilds to escape attentions of
extortionate tax-collectors.

In flat plains land was cut by canals running from great rivers, and dotted with artificial reservoirs (usually referred to in Anglo-Indian jargon as “tanks”), which were made by damming smaller streams or enlarging lakes by stopping their outlets. From these water-supplies, whether natural or artificial, water was raised by counterpoised “sweeps”, and fed into smaller channels which watered fields. “Persian wheel”, turned by an ox, is nowhere clearly mentioned in early sources, though it may hv been used.

Irrigation works, often of enormous size, were undertaken by beneficent kings as religious and social duty. most famous of these reservoirs was that of Girnar, history of which has come down to us, thanks to two inscriptions on site (pp. 62, 104). We do not know when great embankment, over 100 feet thick at base, finally crumbled. Probably largest achievement of Indian [Page 193] irrigation until recent years was lake at Bhojpur, near Bhopal, built in middle of 11th century by Bhoja Paramara, king of Dhara. This too has vanished; embankment was breached by Muslims in 15th century, and has never been restored; but it is evident from those traces which remain that lake originally covered no less than 250 square miles.5 In extreme north of India we read of Suyya, great engineer in service of king Avantivarman of Kashmīr (9th century), who “made streams of Indus and Jhelam flow acc to his will, like snake-charmer his snakes”. In south, at end of our period, Paes saw building of mighty tank at Vijayanagara, embankment of which, he says, was crossbow-shot wide. first efforts at its construction were unsuccessful, so King Kṛṣṇa Deva Raya ordered great human sacrifice of prisoners to appease gods, and finished work with labour of 20,000 men.

Most of larger irrigation works of Hindu India hv now vanished,
but in Ceylon ancient reservoirs of enormous size still exist (pl. III a),
though canal systems which they served hv largely disappeared, and
are only now being repaired. After many centuries of neglect, recent
governments, both in India and Ceylon, hv begun to redevelop the
irrigation systems without which tropical agriculture cannot flourish, and
which were among first concerns of kings of ancient times.



AGRICULTURE AND STOCKBREEDING
The staple corn crops of ancient India were, as they r today, wheat and
barley in cool north and elsewhere as winter crops, rice in irrigated
plains, and millet in dryer lands, such as parts of Deccan Plateau,
where rice would not grow. Among other crops sugar cane was widely
grown, and sugar exported to Europe, while leaf vegetables and gourds of
various kinds were grown nearly everywhere, as was sesamum, much
valued for its edible oil. Numerous types of peas, beans and lentils were
grown everywhere. South India, especially Keraḻa (Malabar), grew many
spices, particularly pepper, cardamom, ginger and cinnamon, which were
carried all over India and exported to Europe. Himalayan foothills
produced precious saffron. Cotton was at all times staple textile
crop.

Of fruits pride of place was taken by mango, which was grown in
orchards and much valued. small Indian banana, or plantain, was also
grown in damper parts of land. coconut was comparatively late
importation from S.-E. Asia, and is not mentioned [Page 194] in early
sources, though it was known in Middle Ages. In coastal areas were
grown palmyra and talipot palms, which provided India’s chief writing
material, and also alcoholic drinks now known as toddy and arrack.

Another valued palm was areca, whose hard, slightly narcotic nut,
broken up, mixed with lime and other ingredients, and wrapped in leaf
of betel vine, formed tāmbūla, or chewing quid, which was
introduced into Northern India from South early in Christian era,
and has ever since been most popular source of post-prandial solace to the
Indian. date palm was grown in dryer regions of West, but is
little mentioned in literature. sour fruit of tamarind was much used
to flavour curry. grape, introduced from Persia with almond and
walnut, was cultivated in Western Himalayas. Sandal and other trees
provided much-prized fragrant woods; these trees mostly grew in South.

The Greek travellers were most impressed by fertility of India’s soil
and energy and ability of her cultivators. modern traveller’s
impressions r diametrically opposite, but Greeks judged Indian
agriculture by standards lower than ours, and soil was less exhausted
then than now. Greeks found it great source of wonder that India
produced two crops year. In wetter parts of land two crops
might even grow without irrigation, while in plains summer crop of
rice would grow during monsoon, and second irrigated crop in dry
season.

Ancient India knew use of manure, and Arthaśāstra lays down
several rules for management of king’s farms which indicate well-
developed agricultural technique. Indian peasant of today is so
conservative in his methods that we may assume that ordinary villagers
of ancient days cultivated land much as they do now, ploughing with
shallow wooden ploughs drawn by oxen, harvesting with sickles, threshing
with oxen, and winnowing by tossing their corn in wind. Iron
ploughshares were certainly known, however, for they r mentioned in
literature.

The basic livestock of peasant was cattle, used for ploughing,
transport and food. Villages employed communal cowherd, who drove the
cattle, branded with their owners’ marks, to waste beyond ploughed
fields every morning, and returned with dm at dusk. We hv no means of
comparing yield of cattle of ancient days with that of their scraggy
modern counterparts, but as there was more pasture and waste it may have
been better. Milk and curd were important articles of diet, as was ghee
( ghrta), made from melted butter by skimming off solid fat, and leaving
only liquid butter-oil, which would keep indefinitely in hot climate.

[Page 195] inviolability of cow was of slow growth. Though
there seems to hv been some feeling against killing of cows even in
Vedic times, Asoka did not forbid slaughter of cattle, and oxen, at any
rate, were killed for food even later. But Arthaśāstra refers to the
existence of herds of aged, diseased and sterile cattle, 6 and it therefore
appears that before Christian era cattle were normally allowed to die a
natural death, at least in some parts of country. same work suggests
that those who kill cattle should be put to death, but from context it is
clear that this prescription applies only to killers of cattle stolen from the
royal herds.

As well as cattle owned by cultivating peasants there were large herds
belonging to professional herdsmen, who led semi-nomadic life in the
wilder parts of country. One important tribe of these people, the
Abhiras, which dwelt in widely scattered localities of South Rajasthan,
Malwa and Sind around beginning of Christian era, was perhaps
responsible for development of cult of Kṛṣṇa in his pastoral aspect,
and Abhira chiefs set up short-lived kingdom in N.-W. Deccan on the
ruins of Sātavahānas.

Other domestic animals included buffalo, second only to ox as a
beast of burden, and favourite victim of sacrifices to goddess Durga,
whose cult became very popular in Middle Ages. goat was bred
widely, as was sheep in cooler districts. fine goats’ wool fabric
of Kashmīr was known and used widely in Northern India, and heavier
sheep’s and yaks’ wool blankets were exported in small quantities from the
hills to Northern Plains, where winter nights r usually cold enough
to make their comfort pleasant. domestic pig was also known, though it
did not play very important part in rural economy.

Horses were bred chiefly in Sind and North-West. They would not
breed well in Deccan, and were regularly imported by sea from Sind,
Persia and Arabia to ports of Western India. horse was always a
luxury animal, used chiefly by warrior class. For ordinary people the
chief means of conveyance was ox, of which certain varieties could
draw carts at considerable pace. kings of Vijayanagara delighted in
watching races of light carts to which an ox and horse were yoked.

The elephant was certainly tamed by time of Buddha. It rarely
breeds in captivity, and therefore it had to be hunted and captured alive.

Special forest tracts were designated as elephant preserves, inhabited by
trackers, hunters and tamers, in employ of king. Generally the
ownership of elephants was confined to kings and chiefs, and peasants
living in vicinity of elephant [Page 196] forests must hv cursed the
depredations of these beasts, which would frequently leave jungle to
raid clearings.

The camel is not often mentioned, but it was certainly known and used as
a beast of burden in dryer parts of country, and by Middle Ages
was also found in Deccan. Some medieval dynasties employed the
camel in war. mule and ass were other common beasts of burden.

The half-wild pariah dog was as common in early India as it is today, and
dogs were also used in hunting. In hills special breed of large dog,
perhaps resembling modern Tibetan mastiff, was famous beyond the
bounds of India. Persian emperor Artaxerxes I (465–424 B.C.) is said by
Herodotus to hv exempted inhabitants of four Babylonian villages
from taxation in return for their breeding Indian dogs for war and hunting.

These dogs were also known in Egypt of Ptolemies. dog is only
once mentioned with respect and affection in Indian literature, and was
rarely if ever treated as pet. exception occurs in Mahābhārata,
where five Pandava brothers and their wife Draupadi take their dog with
them on their final pilgrimage to heaven, and eldest brother Yudhisthira
refuses to enter without his faithful friend. It has been suggested that the
episode shows Iranian influence, for with Zoroastrians dog was a
sacred animal. domestic cat is rarely mentioned.

The hunting leopard or cheetah ( citraka) is only referred to as wild
beast until Middle Ages, and similarly hawk was not tamed in early
times. Hawking and hunting with cheetahs did not become popular among
the ruling classes until 11th century, and custom may hv been
learnt from Muslims.

The fowl was known, though eggs played but small part in diet of
early India. peacock, in earlier times, was certainly used as food, and
was favourite dish of emperor Aśoka, 7 until he adopted vegetarian
diet. We read of whole villages of peacockrearers, who supplied their birds
to kings and wealthy people, at first largely for food, but later chiefly for
ornament. Several other ornamental fowl, especially ruddy sheldrake or
brahmany duck ( cakravāka) were kept in parks of rich, and parrots
and mynahs were very popular as pets, especially with ladies, who are
referred to as devoting long hours to teaching birds to talk.

Silkworms were bred and reared, chiefly in Bengal and Assam. It has
been suggested by some that silk was known even in Vedic times, and silk-
making moths were certainly indigenous to India; but it is probable that silk
was first introduced to India from China by way of Burma Road, in the
second half of 1st millennium B.C. [Page 197] earliest certain
references to silk r found in Buddhist scriptures, and in the
Arthaśāstra, where it is called cinapatta, “the Chinese cloth”. In 2nd

century B.C. Chinese traveller Chang K’ien found that Chinese silk was
imported into Bactria by way of India, and this suggests that even at this
time Indians had not yet fully mastered art of spinning and weaving
fine silks, which they certainly did later. Besides silkworm another
insect of commercial importance was lac-insect, which provides both
the resin used for shellac (and in India for articles of ornament), and also
the dye known as “lake-dye.”

THE WILD TRIBES
In Himalayan foothills and remoter parts of Vindhyas and the
Deccan wild tribes still exist. Most of dm r now partly civilized and
Hinduized, but some, though happy folk, knit together by tribal custom into
solid, self-supporting and self-sufficient communities, still preserve vestiges
of ferocious and barbaric tradition. Gonds of Eastern Deccan
offered human sacrifices at their fertility ceremonies until well into last
century, victims often being unfortunate villagers kidnapped from the
more civilized settlements, while head-hunting among Nagas of Assam
is even now not completely stamped out.

At one time, of course, practically whole of India was inhabited by
such peoples, and in ancient and medieval times they were more numerous
and occupied wider area than at present. From earliest invasions they
waged losing battle against advancing culture of Āryans, and at all
times they were source of danger to outposts of civilization in the
vicinity of their lands. brief statement of Asoka’s policy towards the
forest tribes (p. 53f) throws flood of light on ruthless policy of earlier
kings towards them. Many primitive peoples were exterminated and many
more lost their identity in course of growth of Hindu civilization; but
some accepted suzerainty of their civilized overlords, and retained their
ancestral lands. Arthaśāstra mentions such people as useful in time of
war. Many of these tribes came more and more under influence of
Āryan ways, and their tribal cults were roughly assimilated to Hinduism by
wandering brāhmaṇs. Such tribes were undoubtedly ancestors of many
lower Hindu castes of later times. Some primitive tribes may well have
learnt enough from Āryans to become powerful, and it has been
reasonably suggested that more than one important medieval dynasty
originated in such way.

At all times, however, uncivilized tribal peoples continued to exist [Page
198] in outlying districts in virtual independence, perhaps occasionally
paying tribute in kind to representative of their overlord. last great
king of Hindu India, Krsna Deva Raya of Vijayanagara, mentioned dm in
a brief textbook on government in Telugu, Āmuktamālyada. When the
forest folk multiplied in kingdom, he wrote, they caused no little trouble
to king and his subjects; but, like Asoka, he advocated fair and honest
treatment towards them. “If king grows angry with them, he cannot
wholly destroy them, but if he wins their affection by kindness and charity
they serve him by invading enemy’s territory and plundering his forts.”8
At all times wild tribesmen were danger to settled villagers in
the outlying parts of country. In medieval literature, both in Sanskrit and
the Dravidian vernaculars, r references to these wild raiders pillaging
crops and herds and houses, and capturing victims for human sacrifice. The
area of their operations was gradually pushed back, and as more and more
primitive tribes were assimilated to Hindu order they became gradually
less dangerous; but throughout period covered by this book they were a
source of fear in many parts of India, bogey men with which mothers
frightened their naughty children. No doubt many of characteristics of
the demons and malevolent spirits of Hindu mythology, Nagas, YaKṛṣṇas,
Raksasas and like, were acquired from wild tribes (p. 317f).



THE TOWN
By time of Buddha, there were small towns all over North India,
and some, such as Kasi (Banaras) and Kauśāmbī, had an antiquity of
centuries; but even at this time large cities were few. acc to an
ancient Buddhist tradition, at time of Buddha’s “Great Decease” the
disciple Ananda said that he regretted that his master was to die in so small
a town as Kuśinagara, and mentioned six cities which he considered
important enough for Buddha to die in: Śrāvastī, Campā, Rājagrha, Sāketa
(later generally known as Ayodhyā), Kauśāmbī, and Kāśī. These were
evidently greatest cities of 5th century B.C., but their sites r still not
wholly excavated, and we hv no good means of judging their size, except
in case of one of them. This is Rajagrha, walls of which still remain,
and show that fortified area had perimeter of twenty-five miles. The
whole area was not built upon, but Rajagrha was garden city, with a
central core, and houses in suburbs surrounded by extensive parks and
fields.

Pataliputra in time of Mauryas, acc to Megasthenes, [Page
199] was long narrow city, stretching nine miles along bank of the
Ganges, and reaching only one and half miles inland. It was no doubt
mainly built-up, unlike Rajagrha, which covered larger area but must have
had smaller population. At end of our period Paes states that
Vijayanagara was larger and more populous than Rome and contained
100,000 houses, from which we may infer that its population was at least
half million, and probably more.

At time of writing several small excavations hv been made at
various Indian city sites, but only one such site, and that not representative,
has been excavated sufficiently to reveal plan of city. This is
Taksasila, where two cities hv been discovered, one dating from time
of Achæmenid kings of Persia and other from Greco-Bactrian
period. Both were built on either side of broad main street, and larger
houses of both had central courtyards, in manner traditional in India
from days of Harappā Culture; but in other respects two were

very different. first city, known to archæologists as Bhir Mound, shows
no trace of town planning; on irregular and crooked main street opened
a maze of narrow alleys, ramifying in all directions at whim of many
private builders. second city, known as Sirkap, had fine main street
some twenty feet wide, running due north and south, with lesser [Page 200]
roads running off it at right angles and at regular intervals; it was evidently
strictly planned.


Fig. xiv.-An ancient Indian city, c. 2nd-1st century, B.C. (based on evidence of contemporary
sculpture). (Reproduced from Percy Brown’s “Indian Architecture (Buddhist and Hindu period),”
published by D. B. Taraporevala Sons & Co. Ltd., Bombay)
We cannot attribute regular layout of Sirkap wholly to orderly
Greeks. Two thousand years before their arrival in India cities of
Mohenjo Daro and Harappā had been laid out on similar regular lines, and
there is little doubt that other Indian cities were carefully planned. It was by
no means uncommon for powerful king to build wholly new capital, and
this would give much scope to town-planner. Arthaśāstra9 gives
detailed instructions for establishment of such new city. It advises a
square gridiron plan, divided into wards or sectors by six main roads, three
running north and south, and three east and west. chief temples were to
be located in centre, and different classes of community were to be
segregated in separate wards. fortified city of Sisupalgarh was certainly
built as an almost exact square of nearly mile on each side (pl. XIa), but it
has not been sufficiently excavated to ascertain whether street plan
conformed to Arthaśāstra’s scheme.10 It is possible that northern
city of Ahicchatra in Uttar Pradesh did so approximately, but here again the
excavated portions r not sufficient to tell with certainty.

The city had two foci, palace and temple. Of ancient Indian palace
architecture we know little; fragments of highly polished columns of
the Mauryan palace at Pataliputra, and large building at Taksasila which
may hv been palace, r all that hv survived except from very late
period; but from this and other evidence it would seem that palace was
usually situated in or near centre of city, and that it was often
defended by fortifications as sort of citadel.

Temples hv survived better, though we hv no Hindu temples from
pre-Gupta times. In temple religious sentiments of people were
largely concentrated. From temple came great and splendid religious
processions which filled and still fill heart of ordinary Hindu with
almost superhuman exaltation. temple, especially if it was great and
famous temple in one of sacred cities, 1 was itself city in miniature in
the medieval period (fig. xv). It was enormously wealthy, and source of
wealth to town from many pilgrims who visited it. Such temple
was great landowner, with many employees, such as priests, musicians,
attendants, and dancing girls for temple services, staff of scribes and
accountants, and many craftsmen and labourers. Often [Page 201]
temple maintained schools and refuges for sick men and animals; it
dispensed charity to beggars, and relieved poorer citizens in time of
distress and famine. Like medieval European monastery it might grant
land and privileges to its servants in princely wise. great temple,
especially in Deccan, was corporate body which often played bigger
part in life of ordinary citizen than civil government. larger
Buddhist and Jaina monasteries were similarly influential in their own
districts, though they were usually located outside big cities.

From literary sources, and from evidence of sculpture and painting,
we cn get some idea of houses of wealthy, which probably did not
differ greatly, except in size, from palaces of kings. typical larger
town house was one of several storeys; threestoreyed buildings seem to
have been quite common, and there r literary references to houses of
seven and even eleven storeys, though latter at least r hardly credible.


Down to Gupta times most houses, from palaces to small cottages, were
built with barrel-vaulted roofs, with gable-ends and often ornate finials (fig.

xiv). Roofs were both thatched and tiled. Later high barrel-vaulted roof
gave way to flatter type, with overhanging eaves. Larger houses of later
times usually had raised terraces or flat roofs on which members of the
household slept in hot weather. In historical times houses were not, like the
houses of Indus cities, closed in by bare [Page 202] walls, but had
windows and balconies overlooking street. In medieval period the
balconies were often screened with lattices, so that ladies of the
household might see without being seen, but balconies of houses
depicted at Bhārhut and Sānchū hv no such screens. walls were
whitewashed, and, as today, might be decorated with painted pictures and
ornamentation, both on flat and in stucco relief. usual larger house
had square courtyard surrounded by veranda, behind which were the
living quarters. Bathrooms r mentioned in literature, sometimes with
running water, probably diverted from nearby stream.

The ancient Indian greatly loved flowers and trees. Megasthenes
describes with wonder beautiful parks surrounding palace of
Candragupta Maurya, and many references in Sanskrit literature show that
wealthy citizens had gardens attached to their houses, and often larger parks
in suburbs containing pavilions in which they spent much of their
leisure. There r references in poetry to artificial hillocks ( krīdāśaila),
which suggest that landscape gardens of Japanese type were sometimes
laid out.

As in all hot climates an expanse of water was an almost essential feature
of garden, and parks of wealthy contained artificial lakes and
pools, often with fountains, and with steps leading down to dm for
bathing. further refinement, for cooling air in hot season, was the
“water-machine”( variyantra), which, from description of poet
Kālidāsa, 11 seems to hv been sort of revolving spray, rather like that
used to water lawns at present day. In bathing pools citizens
would cool themselves in hot weather, and literature contains many
references to kings and heroes playing in water with their wives and
concubines. We also read of subterranean chambers at one end of such
bathing tanks, 12 cooled by water surrounding dm on all sides, in which
the tired bather might rest. Another feature of pleasure garden which
was looked on as almost indispensible was swing, in which adults of both
sexes took delight. Gardens were watered by channels which led from the
main tank to trees and flower beds.

Specially loved were flowering trees, which r very frequently
mentioned in poetry, especially asoka (Saraca indica), smallish tree
bearing mass of lovely scarlet or orange blossoms, which, it was said,
would only flower if kicked by beautiful woman; other favourites were
the tall pale-flowered sirisa ( Albizzia spp. ), fragrant, orange-flowered
kadamba ( Anthocephalus cadamba), and red kiṃśuka ( Butea frondosa);
the banana ( kadalī) was grown for ornament as well as for its fruit. Bushes
and creepers were also much loved, especially jasmine, of which there
were many varieties, and [Page 203] white atimukta (Hiptage
madablota); other popular trees were campaka (Michelia champaca),
with very fragrant yellow flowers, and hibiscus, or China rose ( japā).

Most beloved of all flowers, and subject of much religious and other
symbolism, was lotus or water-lily, in its many varieties. This beautiful
flower poets never tired of mentioning, giving it dozens of synonyms
and epithets. rose, common enough in North India today, was
apparently unknown, and was probably introduced by Muslims.

As well as private gardens of rich there were public gardens and
parks, often mentioned in story. In vicinity of most cities were groves
which were favourite resorts of townspeople. Asoka took pride in
the fact that he had planted such groves for recreation of man and beast,
and some other kings r recorded as having followed his example.

Of life and homes of city poor we r told little in literature, but
the cottages here and there depicted in early sculpture are, like larger
houses, barrel-roofed, and apparently one-roomed. We must assume that the
poorer folk dwelt, as they do today, in huts made of wood, reed or mud
brick, and thatched with straw. Many no doubt had no homes at all, but
slept in odd corners of city with their few possessions around them.

Efforts were made by more energetic authorities to provide some
amenities for poorer citizens. Arthaśāstra suggests that public
well should be provided for every ten families. same text recommends
a fixed tariff of fines for leaving rubbish in streets, and stringent
precautions against fires; every home was to keep elementary fire-fighting
equipment in readiness, and on an outbreak of fire all able-bodied citizens
in neighbourhood were liable to be called on to help put out flames.

The city authorities were to provide drainage for surface water, and fines
were to be imposed for blocking drains.13 We cannot tell how far these
recommendations were put into practice, but it is hardly likely that they had
no basis whatever in fact.

Undoubtedly most remarkable description of an ancient Indian city is
contained in early Tamil poem Garland of Madurai, said to have
been written in honour of 2nd century Pāṇḍyan king Neduñjeliyaṉ, but
probably century or two later. After long panegyric on king, poet
describes various regions of his kingdom, and concludes with an
account of his capital city, Madurai. This is too long to quote, but we must
at least summarize this part of lovely poem, which has realism rare in
the literature of North.

The poet enters city by its great gate, posts of which are
carved [Page 204] with images of goddess Laksmi, and which is
grimy with ghee, poured in oblation upon it to bring safety and
prosperity to city it guards. It is day of festival, and city is gay
with flags, some, presented by king to commemorate brave deeds,
flying over homes of captains, and others waving over shops
which sell gladdening toddy. streets r broad rivers of people,
folk of every race, buying and selling in market-place or singing to
the music of wandering minstrels.

A drum beats, and royal procession passes down street, with
elephants leading to sound of conchs. refractory beast breaks his
chain, and tosses like ship in an angry sea until he is again brought to
order. Chariots follow, with prancing horses and fierce footmen.

Meanwhile stall-keepers ply their trade, selling sweet cakes,
garlands of flowers, scented powder and betel quids. Old women go
from house to house, selling nosegays and trinkets to womenfolk.

Noblemen drive through streets in their chariots, their gold-
sheathed swords flashing, wearing brightly-dyed garments and wreaths
of flowers. From balconies and turrets many jewels of the
perfumed women who watch festival flash in sunlight.

The people flock to temples to worship to sound of music,
laying their flowers before images and honouring holy sages.

Craftsmen work in their shops-men making bangles of conch shell,
goldsmiths, cloth-dealers, coppersmiths, flower-sellers, vendors of
sandalwood, painters and weavers. Foodshops busily sell their wares-
greens, jak-fruit, mangoes, sugar candy, cooked rice and chunks of
cooked meat.

In evening city prostitutes entertain their patrons with
dancing and singing to sound of lute ( yāḻ), so that streets are
filled with music. Drunken villagers, up for festival, reel in the
roadways, while respectable women, make evening visits to the
temples with their children and friends, carrying lighted lamps as
offerings. They dance in temple courts, which r clamorous with
their singing and chatter.

At last city sleeps-all but goblins and ghosts who haunt the
dark, and bold housebreakers, armed with rope ladders, swords and
chisels, to break through walls of mud houses. But watchmen
are also vigilant, and city passes night in peace.

Morning comes with sound of brāhmaṇs intoning their sacred
verses. wandering bards renew their singing, and shopkeepers
busy themselves opening their booths. toddy-sellers again ply
their trade for thirsty morning travellers. drunkards reel to their
feet and once more shout on streets. All over city is heard the
sound of opening doors. Women sweep faded flowers of the
festival from their courtyards. Thus busy everyday life of city is
resumed.14
The ancient Indian city was source of pride to its inhabitants. One of
the most memorable records of such pride is contained in 5th century
Mandasor inscription of guild of silk-weavers, already mentioned in
another connexion (p. 149). This commemorates building and
subsequent repair by guild of splendid temple of [Page 205] Sun.

A poem recording event was composed “with great care” by one
Vatsabhatti, probably local hack-poet commissioned for occasion, and
was engraved on stone as perpetual memorial. No doubt echoing the
thought of his patrons, Vatsabhatti writes in glowing terms of his city,
“Where water-lilies r ever shaken by tremulous ripples,
and geese r as though shut in cage of pollen,
blown from lotuses, which shine in lakes,
bent by weight of their own stamens;
“Where groves r adorned with trees
bowed under burden of blossoms,
and with bee-swarms, drunk with honey,
and with women ever-singing;
“Where lovely women dwell
in houses a-flutter with flags,
most purely white, most lofty,
like fair hills of cloud that glitter with vine of lightning;
“Where other mansions, adorned with groves of swaying bananas,
lovely as high peak of Mount Kailāśa,
shine with their long roof-ridges and pavilions,
loud with noise of music, and gay with pictures.”
And so poet in fanciful language describes beauty of city, the
goodness of local king, benevolence of guild, and splendour
of new temple, until he concludes:
“As moon clear heavens,
as kaustubha2 breast of Visnu,
this fairest of temples adorns
our wholly noble city.”15


THE MAN ABOUT TOWN
We cn learn much about life of Greek and Roman bourgeoisie
from literature and archæological remains; but comparable literature of
India was less realistic, and there is no Indian counterpart of Pompeii.

Nevertheless there is enough evidence to reconstruct life of well-to-
do young Indian in some detail from secular literature, one of our most
important sources being treatise on erotics, Kāmasūtra (p. 171),
which was composed to instruct him in one of his chief recreations.

His room, we r told, 16 should contain pleasant and soft bed, [Page
206] with pure white coverlet, decorated canopy, and two pillows, one at
the foot and other at head. It should also hv divan, at head of
which perfumed unguents, flowers, and pots of collyrium should be kept on
a little table. On floor nearby should be placed cuspidor, to receive the
red expectoration caused by betel chewing, and chest for ornaments and
clothes. On wall should hang lute ( vīṇ ā), and room should also
contain drawing table, few palm-leaf books, round seat and gaming-
board. Attached to house should be an aviary, garden containing
swings, an arbour of climbing plants, and grass bank on which owner
might sit in shade with his guests.

Rising in morning man about town washes, cleans his teeth,
anoints his body with unguents and perfume, puts collyrium on his eyes,
dyes his lips with red lac, and looks at himself in mirror. Then he chews
a betel quid to sweeten his breath. He baths every day, rubs his body with
oil every other day, shaves his face every fourth day, and his whole body
every fifth or tenth day. He eats three meals daily. Much of his time is spent
in charming, graceful idleness. He amuses himself by teaching his parrots
and mynahs to talk, or by watching fighting cocks, quails or rams; he
converses with parasites who surround him. In hotter weather he
takes an afternoon nap.

He had many intellectual pleasures however. He was not merely patron
and passive admirer of arts, but was encouraged by society to be himself
creative. He should know something of sixty-four arts (p. 183). He
might be poet in his own right, and some of surviving Sanskrit poetry
is not work of professionals. Large gatherings were often held under the
patronage of kings or wealthy men for recitation of poetry, and smaller
groups would often meet together for same purpose, either at home
of one of group, or at house of courtesan. These literary parties are
mentioned in Kāmasūtra as among chief pleasures of educated
man. members of such circles might form regular social clubs, and
“should stand together in time of trouble as in prosperity, … and hospitably
entertain newcomers to their group”.17 ancient Indian, like his modern
descendant, was usually an extrovert, delighting in company of his
fellows, and warm-hearted in his friendships. immense stress laid in
sacred literature on duty of hospitality encouraged and gave religious
sanction to social propensities of time.

Sometimes literary parties were held in open air, in gardens and
groves about town, and might be diversified with cock-fighting and
bathing. educated man might also be painter; his [Page 207] sanctum,
as we hv seen, contained painting-board or easel, and Kāmasūtra
even suggests that he should hv special room for sculpture, wood-
carving and clay modelling.



AMUSEMENTS
The amusements of ancient Indian townsman were by no means all
creative or intellectual. Numerous festivals, participated in by rich and poor
alike, divided Hindu year, and were marked by merrymaking and
processions. most popular festival in early times was Festival of
Spring, in honour of Kama, Love-god, who, though he played only a
small part in thought of theologians, was evidently very popular
divinity. At this festival even respectable citizens forgot their caste
restrictions, and paraded streets scattering red powder over their
neighbours, squirting dm with coloured water, and playing all kinds of
practical jokes. festival still survives under name Holi, though the
Love-god now plays no part in it. It is clearly survival of primitive and
bloody fertility ceremony; but even at its earliest appearance grim
significance of red powder seems to hv been lost, and it was sort of
Hindu saturnalia, time of universal merrymaking, and licence of all kinds.

Though much reprobated by brāhmaṇ authors of Smtri literature,
gambling was popular at all times and among all classes except more
rigidly religious people. Six-sided dice hv been found in Indus cities,
and “Gamester’s Lament” of Ṛ g Veda testifies to popularity of
gambling among early Āryans (p. 403ff).

The word aksa in context of gambling is generally roughly translated
“dice”, but aksas in earliest gambling games were not dice, but
small hard nuts called vibhīśaka or vibhīdaka; apparently players drew a
handful of these from bowl and scored if number was multiple of
four. Later, oblong dice with four scoring sides were used; like the
European gamester Indian employed special terminology for the
throws at dice: krta (cater, four), treta (trey), dvāpara (deuce), and kali
(ace). So important was gambling in Indian scheme of things that these
four terms were applied to four periods ( yuga) of æon (p. 321).

Gambling played small but significant part in ritual of royal
consecration ceremony, and gambling hall attached to king’s palace
in later Vedic period had some magical or religious significance, though
its import is not wholly clear. Among chief men of realm, whose
loyalty was confirmed by special ceremony at consecration of king
[Page 208] (p. 42), was akṛṣṇ avāpa, or thrower of nuts or dice,
evidently organizer of royal gambling parties. plot of the
Mahābhārata hinges round great gambling tournament, at which
Yudhisthira lost his kingdom to his wicked cousin Duryodhana, and the
Epic tells similar story in episode of Nala. Arthaśāstra 18
advocates strict control of gambling, which it would confine entirely to
officially-managed gambling houses, financed by tax of five per cent of
the stakes and charge for hire of dice to gamblers, who were to be
forbidden to use their own. Stringent fines were laid down for cheating.

With dice were played board games, similar to our children’s games
such as ludo, which involved combination of chance and skill. By the
early centuries of Christian era one of these, played on board of sixty-
four squares ( aṣṭ apāda), had developed into game of some complexity,
with king-piece, and pieces of four other types, corresponding to corps
of ancient Indian army-an elephant, horse, chariot or ship, and four
footmen. original game needed four players, and their moves were
controlled by throw of dice. As game was played with pieces
representing military forces, and its strategy suggested that of campaigning
armies, it was known as caturanga, or “four corps”. In 6th century the
game was learnt by Persians, and when Persia was conquered by the
Arabs it quickly spread all over Middle East, under name shatranj,
the Persian corruption of caturanga. It developed into game for two
persons, each with two “armies”, king of one army becoming the
“general” or “minister” of other, and use of dice to control the
moves was given up. It is not quite certain whether these improvements
were made in India or Persia, but latter is more probable.

The game was learnt by crusaders from Muslims, and soon spread
over Europe. By late Middle Ages it had almost attained its modern
form as chess, “general” of Muslim game becoming queen. Thus
the world’s most intellectual game is product of three cultures, each of
which contributed something to its finished form.

Organized outdoor games were not common, except among children and
young women, who r sometimes referred to as playing ball, like Nausicaa
in Odyssey. form of polo, introduced from Central Asia, became
popular among warriors in Middle Ages, though it is little mentioned in
literature, and kind of hockey was also played. But, in general, ancient
India did not put such stress on athletics as did Mediterranean world.

Chariot racing is mentioned as early as Ṛ g Veda, and bullock racing was
popular [Page 209] in late medieval period. Boxing and wrestling are
often referred to, but were not generally hobbies of respectable young
men, but preserve of low-caste professional pugilists, who performed
for amusement of an audience. archery contest, however, was a
much-loved amusement of warrior class, and vivid descriptions of such
contests occur in Epics.

Classical sources refer to gladiatorial contests at court of Candragupta
Maurya, and in medieval Deccan duelling became frequent. The
Portuguese traveller Nuniz writes that if two nobles of Vijayanagara
quarrelled they would fight to death in presence of king and his
court. 19 Despite growth of doctrine of non-violence throughout our
period, animal fights were always very popular. favourite animals to be
pitted against each other were fierce little Indian quail ( lāvaka), cock
and ram; we also read of fights between bulls, buffaloes and elephants
(pls. LXXVII, LXXVIII b).

One form of animal contest confined to Dravidian South was the
bullfight, of which we hv vivid description in an early Tamil poem.20
This sport did not closely resemble Spanish bullfight, where scales
are heavily weighted against bull, for here bull appears to hv had
the advantage. fights were popular among herdsmen, who entered the
arena unarmed, and “embraced bull” in an attempt to master it, rather
like cowpunchers of an American rodeo. They made no attempt to kill
the bull, and it was not previously irritated, but bullfight was evidently a
sport of great danger, for poem contains gory description of a
victorious bull, his horns hung with entrails of his unsuccessful
opponents. bullfight was looked on as an ordeal to test manhood of
young men, since it is stated that girls who watched performance
would choose their husbands from among successful competitors in a
sort of Tamil svayaṃ vara. Though Tamil literature gives no evidence of
this, bullfight had certainly some ritual significance, and was connected
with fertility of crops. similar sport was practised, as part of a
religious ceremonial, by ancient Cretans, and this fact, like many others,
links Tamils with earliest civilizations of Mediterranean world.

Wrestling with young steers is still favourite pastime of some pastoral
peoples of India.

Many of amusements of ancient India were provided by professional
entertainers. As well as those who practised highly developed arts such as
drama, music and dancing, there were others who travelled through town
and village, diverting ordinary folk, who could not fully appreciate the
nuances of more developed art [Page 210] forms. We read of musicians,
bards, acrobats, jugglers, conjurors and snake-charmers, popular then as
now. As well as courtly theatre there was folk-drama, occasionally
referred to in literature, which portrayed scenes of mythology and legend in
dance, song and mime, and from which Sanskrit drama developed.



CLOTHES AND ORNAMENTS
The garments worn from Vedic times onwards did not fundamentally
differ from those of modern Indian. Like most ancient peoples living in
hot climates Indians usually wore lengths of cloth, draped around body
and over shoulders, and fastened with belt and pins. lower
garment ( paridhāna, vasana) was usually such cloth, fastened round the
waist with belt or string ( mekhalā, raśanā); and upper garment
( uttarīya) was another such length, draped shawl-wise over shoulders.

The latter garment was often discarded in home, or in hot weather,
especially by lower orders. third garment ( prāvāra) was also worn,
draped like mantle or cloak, in cold season.

This was general garb of both sexes, as it is today, and varied only in
the size and pattern of cloths and in manner of wearing them.

Sometimes lower garment was of very small proportions, or mere
loincloth (pl. LXXV), but lower garments of rich often reached
almost to feet. In early sculpture lower garment is depicted as
elaborately pleated in front, and held with long girdle, end of which
hung down in front of garment between legs (pl. XXVIa). In some
sculptures girdle appears to hv been end of cloth itself, which
might also be thrown over shoulders in manner of present day
sārī. Sometimes end of cloth was drawn between legs and
fastened at back in manner of dhotī.

Though all these garments were unstitched art of sewing was not
unknown, and women r often depicted wearing jackets or bodices
( colaka, kañcuka) (pl. LXXXI). With invasions of Śakas and
Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia trousers were introduced, and were in vogue
among ruling classes at least until Gupta times, for Gupta kings are
often shown on their coins as wearing trousers (fig. xxiv, p. 381). Kuṣāṇa
kings r shown on their coins, and in remarkable headless statue of
Kaniṣka (pls. XXXb, LXXXIIIe), wearing long quilted coats and quilted
trousers and boots of typically Central Asian type, which must hv been as
uncomfortable in temperature of over one hundred degrees as thick
European clothing worn by pioneers of East India Company. The
wearing of shirts and [Page 211] trousers seems to hv been quite common
in medieval Kashmīr and North-West. In medieval South India
goddesses and queens were often depicted as wearing what seem to be light
close-fitting trousers. cloth used for all these garments varied from
wool, worn in Northern winters, to diaphanous silks and muslins, which
showed limbs of wearer. paintings of Ajanta and Bagh show
that they were often dyed or otherwise patterned with gay stripes and
checks.

In most parts of India footwear was primarily used to protect feet
against scorching earth of Indian summer, but in Himalayas felt
boots of Central Asian pattern were worn.

On their heads men usually wore turbans, which were fastened in many
elaborate patterns (pl. XXIIIe). In early times, at least on festive occasions,
women wore large and complicated headdresses of type not seen
nowadays, but by Gupta period they r usually depicted either bare-
headed, or wearing head-veils or simple tiaralike headdresses. Orthodox
brāhmaṇs shaved whole head with exception of topknot, which
was never cut, but with other classes both sexes usually allowed their hair
to grow long. most popular coiffure with women was large bun at the
nape of neck, often ornamented with fillet or string of jewels (pl.

LXIIe). pigtail, most common at present day, though attested in the
Harappā culture and mentioned in literature, does not often appear in
sculpture until medieval period.

There is some controversy on character of women’s dress in ancient
India. Throughout our period women r depicted in painting and sculpture
as naked to waist, while on other hand great physical modesty of
modern Hindu womanhood is common knowledge. James Fergusson, one
of first serious students of ancient Indian sculpture, declared
categorically that, until Muslim conquest, Hindu women exposed their
breasts in public without least shame.21 This conclusion has, however,
been controverted.22
It is asserted that, like Greeks and Romans, Indian artist and
sculptor followed tradition of showing female form in state of semi-
nakedness, when this had no counterpart in real life. objection,
however, is hardly valid. When portraying real life, rather than mythology
or figure studies, classical artist usually draped his women. In early
sculptures of Bhārhut and Sānchū, on other hand, there is scarcely a
woman with covered breasts, even among crowds in very realistic
reliefs of Indian city life. References to bodices in literature r numerous,
and women with covered breasts do sometimes appear in painting and
sculpture; but [Page 212] in Northern Plains, and hillier parts of the
Deccan, weather is quite cool for several months of year, and use
of bodices may hv been due rather to climate than to modesty. In
Malabar, where many old customs survived long, it was quite normal until
comparatively recent times for women of Nayyar caste to appear in
public naked to waist, and same is true of island of Bali, which
adopted Hindu culture early in Christian era. In some literary sources
there r references to married women wearing veils, but there is no
evidence that these were regularly more than headcoverings, or that they
concealed form of wearer. It is only in late medieval literature that
clear expressions of need of physical, as distinct from mental, modesty
are found. Women in ancient India were considerably restricted in their
activities, and high standard of modesty was demanded of those of the
higher classes (p. 179f); but it is clear that their ideas of propriety in dress
were very different from those of their descendants.

If clothes were simple and few, ornaments were complex and many.

Gold, silver and precious stones of every available kind were always in
demand for personal adornment. Women wore jewelled ornaments on their
foreheads, and along partings of their hair. Earrings were worn by both
sexes, and ears were stretched by heavy and large ornaments, as is done
by women in Tamil country districts to this day. Ornate necklaces were
worn, and wide girdles of linked gold with hanging ropes of pearls. Bangles
and armlets were popular from days of Harappā Culture onwards,
and anklets, often set with little tinkling bells, or with their hollows filled
with rattling pebbles, were as popular then as now. Nose ornaments,
without which Indian women of older generation felt positively
undressed, r nowhere mentioned or depicted, and their use cn only have
been widely adopted after Muslim conquest. few surviving pieces
of jewellery, and representations of jewellery in sculpture and painting,
show that Indian jeweller attained very high standards in his art (pl.

LXXXIIb). It would seem that early Indian, like his modern counterpart,
would often save his money by investing it in jewellery for his wife and
himself. Even poorer people, who could not afford gold or gems, loaded
themselves with jewellery of silver, brass, glass and painted pottery, and all
classes adorned their hair, ears and necks with beautiful flowers which
India provides in abundance.

Cosmetics were used by both sexes. Chief among these was paste made
of finely ground dust of sandalwood, which was smeared over whole
body or applied in patterns, often coloured with lac and other dyes. It was
believed to cool skin in hot season. [Page 213] Collyrium or eye-
salve ( anjana), usually made of black powdered antimony, was very
popular, and, as well as enhancing beauty of eye,was thought to
prevent ophthalmia. Vermilion ( sindura), lac ( lākṣ ā), and yellow pigment
called gorocana, were used to mark beauty-spot on forehead
( tilaka), which might often be large and ornate, and which is still popular
with Indian ladies. lips, tips of fingers and toes, and palms
and soles of feet, were often dyed red with lac. Though exposed parts of
the body were often painted with complicated patterns there is no clear
evidence of tattooing, which is popular nowadays in many parts of India.



FOOD AND DRINK
When Fa-hsien visited India in early 5th century he reported that no
respectable person ate meat, consumption of which was confined to low
castes. He probably exaggerated, but certainly by this time many Hindus of
the higher classes were vegetarians. growth of vegetarianism was of
course linked with doctrine of non-violence, which was already old at
the time of Fa-hsien. It was known in days of Upanisads and was
elaborated by Buddhism and Jainism, which were largely responsible for
the gradual disappearance of greater Vedic sacrifices at which large
numbers of animals were killed and eaten. reign of Asoka is a
landmark in development of vegetarianism, for he encouraged it by his
own example, and forbade outright killing of many animals. But the
Arthaśāstra accepts meat-eating as quite normal, and lays down rules for
the management of slaughterhouses and maintenance of purity of
meat. 23 It was only with growth of Mahayana Buddhism and new
Hinduism that strict vegetarianism became widespread. Even then hunting
and meat-eating were practised by warrior class, and tantric cults of
the Middle Ages restored practice of sacrifice and meat-eating in new
form. Medical texts, even of late period, go so far as to recommend the
use of both meat and alcohol in moderation, and do not forbid eating of
beef. It is doubtful if complete vegetarianism has ever been universal in any
part of India, though in many regions it was and still is practised by most
high-caste Hindus. With prohibition of meat-eating some religious texts
included that of eating garlic and onions, objection to which arose for
obvious reasons, and was never given real religious basis; but it is very
doubtful if this ban ever had any great effect until very late period, except
on pious brāhmaṇs.

There r several references to science of cookery ( supasastra),
which was not disdained even by kings, but no ancient textbook on [Page
214] cookery has survived. From passages in literature we know that
ancient Indian cookery did not differ much from that of present day.

Meat and vegetables alike were seasoned in curries and eaten with rice,
boiled or fried. With curry and rice flat cakes of flour, modern
chapādī, were eaten, and water, milk, or curd were drunk. favourite
cooking medium was ghee, in which food was fried and which was
poured liberally over dish; poorer folk often substituted for ghee oil
of sesamum or mustard. Fruit and sweetmeats of many kinds were as
popular as they r today, but many of Indian sweets eaten nowadays,
such as jalebi, r Muslim importations.

In modern Hinduism there is strong taboo on drinking of alcoholic
beverages, and most of those who drink regularly r either very
Europeanized in their ways or of low caste. moral objection to alcohol
is very ancient, but it was long before ban became widespread, except
among brāhmaṇs. Though Asoka discouraged meat-eating his edicts say
nothing about drinking, and it is therefore evident that he had no strong
moral objections to it, though Buddhism counts drinking of spirits as
one of five cardinal sins (p. 286). In Asoka’s day Buddhism was
apparently more lax in this respect than it later became. lawbooks
condemned drinking, and Fa-hsien stated that respectable Indians did not
drink, but drinking and drunkenness r so frequently mentioned in
literature, especially in that of Tamils, that it is clear that religious
precept was not regularly followed in this particular. Only in 12th
century do we find Kumarapala, Jaina king of Gujarat, forbidding the
production and sale of liquor throughout his kingdom.

The Arthaśāstra advises manufacture of liquor in government
breweries and distilleries, and gives several brief and cryptic recipes,24
which show that there were many alcoholic drinks, some of which r not
popular nowadays; among these were rice beer ( medaka), sort of spiced
beer made of flour ( prasannā), wood-apple wine ( āsava), maireya, liquor
made of raw sugar, bark of meṣ aśṅ ga tree, and pepper, and mango
spirit ( sahakārasurā). Wine from grapes was made in North-West, and
exported in small quantities to rest of India. In South, toddy, the
fermented sap of palmyra or coconut, was staple alcoholic liquor,
and is frequently mentioned in early Tamil literature.

The Arthaśāstra, perhaps reflecting Mauryan conditions, suggests the
appointment of “superintendent of liquor”, not only to control sale and
consumption of alcoholic drinks but to organize their manufacture. text
advises stringent control of private brewing, and of taverns. Tavern-
keepers were to be instructed to make [Page 215] their establishments well-
furnished and comfortable, and to prevent their patrons from over-
indulgence; text even suggests that they should indemnify dm for any
loss sustained while under influence of liquor, and pay fine into the
bargain. Unlike most other oriental traders tavern-keepers, acc to the
Arthaśāstra, were not to be allowed to build their premises close together,
thus discouraging ancient Indian equivalent of “pub-crawling”; text
also suggests complete prohibition of consumption of alcohol “off
the premises”. taverns were often haunts of criminals, and the
king’s spies were advised to keep watchful eye on them. Arthaśāstra
evidently recognizes drinking as an evil, which cannot be wholly forbidden,
but which must be strictly controlled.



ECONOMIC LIFE
It has often been said that ancient Indian society was not an acquisitive
one. Admittedly brāhmaṇs, who claimed moral and spiritual leadership,
set themselves ideals of dignified austerity, but these ideals were not always
followed in practice. brāhmaṇ who attained good local reputation for
the efficient performance of sacrifices and domestic ceremonies might
amass considerable wealth, and if patronized by kings might become a
really rich man. Corporations of such brāhmaṇs often lived on proceeds
of large agricultural estates ( agrahāra), transferred to dm by kings, and
there r accounts of brāhmaṇ landowners living in great wealth. Other
brāhmaṇs, not sufficiently trained to teach Vedas or to sacrifice,
obtained high posts in government service, or even became wealthy by
trade. We hv seen (p. 170) that, acc to doctrine of three
aims of life, place of wealth in Hindu scheme of things was well
established.

In most early Indian literature world is viewed from angle of the
well-to-do. Poverty, it is more than once said, is living death; to serve
another for one’s keep is dog’s life, and not worthy of an Āryan. From the
time of Ṛ g Veda, which contains many prayers for riches, worldly
wealth was looked on as morally desirable for ordinary man, and indeed
essential to full and civilized life. ascetic, whether Buddhist or Jaina,
who voluntarily abandoned his wealth, performed an act of renunciation
which entitled him to utmost respect. Though by this renunciation he
assured himself of spiritual advancement, and was well on way to
salvation ( mokṛṣṇ a), fourth and ultimate aim of existence, ascetic’s
life was not that of ordinary man, and theoretical classification of
the four stages of life (p. 158f) gave ample scope in second stage to the
[Page 216] householder, who was indeed encouraged to build up family
fortunes, and to spend part of dm at least on pleasures of senses.

Thus ideals of ancient India, while not perhaps same as those of the
acquisitive West, by no means excluded money-making. India had not only
a class of luxury-loving and pleasure-seeking dilettanti, but also one of
wealth-seeking merchants and prosperous craftsmen, who, though less
respected than brāhmaṇs and warriors, were honoured in society.

Though basis of ancient Indian industry was at all times the
individual craftsman, aided chiefly by members of his own family, larger
manufactories, worked chiefly by hired labour, were by no means unknown.

Not only did Mauryan state own spinning and weaving workshops (p.

179f), but also shops for manufacture of weapons and other military
supplies, employing salaried craftsmen. larger mines were also owned
and worked by state. But though economic order approximated to a
sort of state socialism in time of Mauryas, it always left scope for
the individual producer and distributor. We read here and there of private
producers who had far transcended status of small home craftsman,
and who manufactured on large scale for wide market. Thus an early
Jaina text25 tells of wealthy potter named Saddalaputta who owned 500
potters’ workshops, and fleet of boats which distributed his wares
throughout Ganges valley; there r few other references, which
confirm that large scale production for wide market was not unknown in
ancient India, though such industrialists as Saddalaputta were no doubt
comparatively rare.

A form of industrial organization on larger scale than individual
craftsman, and probably more common than entrepreneur, was the
workmen’s co-operative group, perhaps comparable to pre-
revolutionary Russian artel; such groups r mentioned in Pali Jataka
stories and elsewhere as carrying out large scale enterprises such as the
building of temples and houses. Their existence tended to encourage
division of labour; thus one man would fashion shaft of an arrow, a
second would fix flights, and third would make and fix point.

Rules r laid down in lawbooks for punishment of breach of
contract by such co-operatives or their individual members.

Much of work of craftsman was sold at door of his workshop
direct to purchaser. Normally each craft or trade was concentrated in a
separate street or bazaar, where craftsman had his workshop, stall and
home. testimony of Megasthenes, corroborated by Arthaśāstra,
shows that in Mauryan times prices were regulated by market officials. The
latter text suggests that, as [Page 217] further effort at maintaining just

price, government officers should buy on open market when any staple
commodity was cheap and plentiful, and release stocks from government
stores when it was in short supply,26 thus bringing down price and
making profit for king into bargain. We hv no definite evidence
that this idea was ever put into effect, but it is striking that ancient Indian
political theorists anticipated by over 2,000 years plans put forward by
the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations for
maintaining stable level of prices of staple commodities on world-wide
scale.

GUILDS
As well as state, another element did much to control prices and
standards of work. This was guild ( śreṇ i), form of industrial and
mercantile organization which played as big part in economy of
ancient India as it did in that of any other ancient or medieval civilization.

There r faint and uncertain references to some sort of guild organization
even in Vedic literature, but by time of composition of Buddhist
scriptures guilds certainly existed in every important Indian town, and
embraced almost all trades and industries-we even read of guild of
thieves.

The guild united both craftsmen’s co-operatives and individual
workmen of given trade into single corporate body. It fixed rules of
work and wages, and standards and prices for commodities in which its
members dealt, and its regulations had force of law, and were upheld by
the king and government. Over its own members guild had judicial
rights, which were recognized by state. guild court could, like caste
council, expel refractory member, penalty which would virtually
preclude him from practising his ancestral trade and reduce him to beggary.

We read in Buddhist literature of guild courts settling quarrels between
members and their wives, and rules of Buddhist order lay down that
a married woman may not be ordained nun without consent of her
husband and his guild. Thus guild had power not only over the
economic, but also over social life of its members. It acted as guardian
of their widows and orphans, and as their insurance against sickness. Its
powers and functions in this respect were very similar to those of caste
councils in more recent times, and, though some authorities would disagree
with us, we cannot but conclude that guilds played an important part in
the evolution of trade castes.

The guild was headed by chief, usually called “Elder” ( jyeṣṭ haka,
in Pāli jeṭṭ haka), who was assisted by small council of [Page 218] senior
members. office of Elder was usually hereditary and held by one of the
richest members of guild. In Pali scriptures Elder is invariably
described as very wealthy man, often with much influence at palace,
and counselling king himself. guilds had corporate life,
symbolized, as in medieval Europe, by possession of banners, and also
of chauris,3 ceremonial yak’s tail flywhisks which were insignia of
nobility. These and other emblems were sometimes granted by royal
charter, and were carried in local religious processions by guildsmen.

Some guilds, again like those of medieval Europe, had their own militias,
which served as auxiliaries of king’s armies in time of need (p. 128).

All over India r to be found inscriptions recording donations of
guilds to religious causes of all kinds, most famous being that of the
Mandasor silk-weavers, to which we hv already referred. guilds must
have had considerable funds to make such large donations, and no doubt
received regular subscriptions from their members, which were augmented
by fines levied on those who transgressed guild law. They sometimes
acted as bankers and trustees. There r references in legal literature to
guilds accepting deposits, and lending money at interest to merchants and
others. They would often act as trustees of religious endowments; pious
would pay sum of money to guild, on condition that it would maintain a
perpetual lamp in temple, or provide new robes annually for monks of
a Buddhist monastery. Inscriptions recording such acts of benevolence are
quite numerous, and no doubt guilds, while duly carrying out their part
of agreement, profited from transactions.

The corporate spirit of guild gave better type of craftsman and
merchant degree of self-respect which he would not otherwise have
found. There is more than one record of riots and affrays between different
guilds and trade groups; this was specially case in medieval Deccan,
where guild and caste often overlapped in function or were virtually
synonymous, and strange division of right and left hand castes led to
much friction (p. 150). fact that more than one guild of same craft is
occasionally recorded in same place suggests that guilds sometimes
broke up.



TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT
At all times work of Indian craftsman, however primitive and
simple his tools, has been admired for its delicacy and skill, and the
technical achievement of ancient India was far from negligible. [Page 219]
Her spinners and weavers could produce semi-transparent silks and muslins
of extreme thinness, which r clearly depicted in sculpture (pl. XXXVIb),
and which were much in demand in Roman Empire. Unlike ancient
Greece and medieval China, India developed no true ceramic art; indeed
from æsthetic point of view no pottery of historical times is as good as
the simply patterned but well designed wares of prehistoric North-West
(fig. iv); but bright hard polish of type of pottery usually called
“northern black polished ware” is very creditable technical achievement.

In working of stone on large scale India’s skill is attested by the
enormous monolithic columns of Mauryan times. Many of these bear
Aśoka’s inscriptions, but it is not certain that they were made and erected
by him; some may hv existed before his time. All r made of sandstone,
from same quarry at Chunar, about twenty-five miles south-west of
BanĀras Some thirty columns hv been found in many parts of Northern
India, from Sānchū in south to Nepalese Tarāī in north. Their
sculptured capitals r great as works of art, but as evidence of Indian
technological achievement columns r even more significant.

Weighing as much as fifty tons, and measuring some forty feet, they were
carved from single blocks of stone, given polish of wonderful hardness
and lustre, and often transported many hundreds of miles to their present
positions. process of their manufacture, polishing and transport has not
yet been fully explained, and secret was apparently lost soon after the
Mauryan period, when school of craftsmen who worked Chunar
sandstone vanished. Though many fine examples of later stone carving have
come down to us, some much more impressive artistically than the
Mauryan columns, it is doubtful whether India ever again showed such
complete mastery of handling of enormous pieces of stone.



Fig. xvi.—Carting Pillar (from an engraved sketch on wall of medieval fortress of
Raichūr, Hyderābād). (Reproduced by permission of Archæological Department, Government of
India)
The Iron Pillar of Meharauli, near Delhi, is even more remarkable,
though of little artistic value and less immediately impressive than the
Mauryan columns. It is memorial to king called [Page 220] Candra, who
was probably Candra Gupta II (c. 376–415), and now stands not far from
the famous Kutb Minar, one of greatest monuments of Muslim India,
though it was originally erected on hill near Ambālā. It is over twenty-
three feet high, and consists of single piece of iron, of size and weight
which could not hv been produced by best European ironfounders
until about one hundred years ago. As with Mauryan columns we have
no clear evidence of how it was made, but it must hv demanded immense
care and labour, and great technical proficiency in preparing and heating the
metal. metallurgical skill of ancient India is further attested by fact
that this pillar, though it has weathered torrential rains of over 1,500
monsoons, shows no sign of rusting. This is not due to fact that the
Indians had discovered some form of stainless steel alloy, for column is
of iron almost chemically pure. process of oxidization demands a
catalyst, and it is great purity of metal which has preserved it so
long, as another memorial to India’s technical skill.



TRADE AND FINANCE
A money economy only existed in India from days of Buddha.

That coinage was introduced from west cannot be proved with certainty,
but earliest clear references to coined money r found in texts looking
back to period shortly after foundation of Achæmenid Empire in
Persia, which was first great empire to mint an official coinage, and
which for time controlled Panjāb. Babylonians and Assyrians
managed with unstamped silver shekels, but Achæmenid emperors
adopted stamped coinage from Lydia and Greek cities of Asia Minor,
which had already employed it for century or two. If India did not learn
the use of coinage from Persians she invented it independently, but the
coincidence is too striking to make this seem probable.

The earliest Indian coinage4 consisted of flat pieces of silver or bronze,
of irregular shape, but fairly accurate in weight. They bore no inscriptions,
but number of punch-marks, significance of which is not finally
established, but which probably included emblems of kings who minted
the coins, and control marks of local officials and merchants. Inscribed
coins were not regularly minted in India until 2nd century B.C., and
though literary evidence suggests that gold coinage may hv existed earlier
the oldest surviving gold coins, other than one or two very rare specimens,
are those of Vīma Kadphises of 1st century A.D. As well as three
usual metals, [Page 221] coins of nickel were minted by some of Greco-
Bactrian kings, while Satavahanas of Deccan made coins of lead,
and various alloys r attested. Small purchases were regularly paid for in
cowryshells ( varāṭ aka), which remained chief currency of poor in
many parts of India until recent times.

The concept of legal tender never seems to hv taken root in Hindu
India, and coins were often current far beyond borders of kingdoms
which minted them. Some important dynasties, such as Palas of Bengal,
did not regularly mint coins, but relied on those of other states. Coins
circulated less rapidly than they do nowadays, and might be current for
centuries; thus Periplus of Erythrean Sea, Greek text of end of
the 1st century A.D., notices that coins of Menander, who ruled in the
Panjāb at least two centuries earlier, were current in port of Barygaza
(Bhrgukaccha, modern Broach, at mouth of Narmada), which
was probably at least 500 miles from Menander’s kingdom. Foreign
currency circulated freely. In North-West, Athenian drachms, as well as
local imitations, were current before invasion of Alexander, and
Achæmenid, Seleucid, Parthian, Roman, Sasanian and Islamic coins were
used at different periods. In South, numerous hoards of Roman imperial
coins hv been found.

Though there is no evidence of highly organized financial machinery of
cheques, drafts and letters of credit, usury was widespread, and
moneylending, except by brāhmaṇs, did not incur reprobation of Hindu
moralists, as it did that of medieval Christianity and Islam. Even in Ṛ g
Veda we read of indebtedness (p. 404), and earliest Dharma Sūtras lay
down rates of interest, and regulations governing debts and mortgages. The
just rate of interest is generally given as 1¼ per cent. per month, or fifteen
per cent per year. Later commentators interpret this as applying only to
secured loans, and in practice rates of interest were often much higher.

Manu27 and some other lawgivers lay down sliding scale of interest for
unsecured loans, acc to class of debtor: brāhmaṇs 24 per
cent., ksatriyas 36 per cent., vaiśyas 48 per cent., and śūdras 60 per cent. per
year. Arthaśāstra28 gives, beside “just rate”, three other rates of
interest, inadequately defined, but apparently applicable to short-term loans
for commercial ventures: normal commercial rate, 5 per cent. per
month; rate for merchants travelling through forests (overland caravan
traders), 10 per cent. per month; and rate for seafaring merchants, 20 per
cent. per month. These enormous rates of interest, 60, 120, and 240 per
cent. per year respectively, r measures of both profit and risk of
ancient Indian commerce.

[Page 222] Humane regulations on indebtedness r laid down in the
Arthaśāstra and some other legal texts. Interest payments should cease
when total interest paid equals principal. Loans advanced on
securities used by creditor for his own profit (e.g. beasts of burden)
should be free of interest. Husbands r responsible for their wives’ debts,
but not wives for those of their husbands. But later lawbooks provide
many escape clauses and sometimes completely set aside these earlier
injunctions. Debtors might be imprisoned, or enslaved by their creditors,
until they had worked off their debts. We read of debtors, dogged
everywhere by their creditors, and at last committing suicide in desperation.

The immense expense of family ceremonials of Hinduism, periodic
dearth, dowering of daughters, and many other factors, worked then as
now to drive less fortunate into debt, and, then as now, Indian
creditor might be hard man.

We hv seen that trade guilds might act as bankers, both receiving
deposits and issuing loans. king or his local officer might make loans to
peasants to relieve dearth, or to encourage cultivation of waste lands and
the development of irrigation. larger temples also sometimes served as
bankers, and in South village communes occasionally made loans to
peasants. There were many professional bankers and moneylenders,
however, śreṣṭ hins (in Pali, seṭṭ hi).5
The sresthin was not merely moneylender or banker, but usually a
merchant as well. At all times until coming of Europeans, banking in
India was by-product of trading, and most sresthins had other sources of
income besides moneylending. They appear as leading members of guilds,
often fabulously wealthy. Though craftsman frequently sold his wares
direct to consumer peasants’ surplus products were largely in the
hands of middlemen, and class of large merchants, as distinct from small
traders and pedlars, existed at least from time of Buddha. In the
Jataka stories we read of sresthins cornering grain, and buying at their own
price products of craftsmen who were virtually their employees. The
term sresthin seems sometimes to hv been title of honour, held only by
merchants of wealth and consequence. In Buddhist scriptures we read of
chief sresthins, honoured by kings, and with places in royal councils.

Under Guptas chief banker or sresthin was sometimes member of
the local advisory council which aided district officer in controlling
local affairs (p. 103).

Though in early literature and inscriptions srenis or guilds seem [Page
223] to hv been chiefly organizations of producers, there were also guilds
or companies of merchants. Such merchant corporations became very
important in medieval Deccan, and had branches in many cities. One
such was Viravalanjigar, freely translated “the Company of Gentlemen
Merchants”, which had members in every important city of Peninsula
and was controlled by central council at Aihole, in Southern Hyderabad.

The company known as Maṇ igrāma functioned not only in Southern India,
but also in Ceylon, where it hired its mercenaries to Sinhalese kings.

Co-operative ventures both in production and distribution were well
known in Hindu India, but they were normally carried out by temporary
associations of craftsmen and merchants, and these merchant companies
were in no way comparable to modern joint stock company. Their
members may from time to time hv undertaken corporate ventures, but
the normal function of mercantile companies was not trading itself, but
protecting, furthering and regulating activities of their members.

Overland caravans, though consisting of carts and pack animals owned and
led by individual merchants, would be organized and controlled by officers
of company, and guarded by company’s mercenaries. They played a
similar part in maritime trade, and probably owned warehouses and
“factories”, where their members might store their wares in safety.

Members travelling to strange cities would receive help from officers of the
local branch, and, like craft guilds, mercantile companies no doubt
helped members who fell on hard times, prevented adulteration,
undercutting and other malpractices, and represented their members at the
king’s court.



CARAVANS AND TRADE-ROUTES
By time of Buddha recognized trade-routes covered most of
Northern India, and by Mauryan times similar routes existed in the
Peninsula. Among chief of these was one which ran from Ganges
port of Tāmraliptī, not far from modern Calcutta, up river to old
city of Campā, and thence through Pataliputra and Banāras to Kauśāmbī,
whence branch went to port of Bhrgukaccha on mouth of the
Narmada by way of Vidiśā and Ujjayinī. From Kauśāmbī main trunk
road passed along south bank of Jamnā to Mathurā, from which a
branch crossed modern Rājasthān and Thar Desert to port of
Patala, near mouth of Indus. main route passed on by the
modern Delhi and crossed five rivers of Panjāb by way of Sākala (?

Siālkot) to north-western city of Takṣaśilā, whence it continued up the
Kabul Valley and on into Central Asia. great cities to north of the
[Page 224] Ganges and Jamnā were linked to trunk route by recognized
branch roads. Though its course has varied somewhat through centuries
this has always been main artery of Northern India. Mauryan
emperors cared for this great road, which was marked with milestones, and
provided with wells and rest-houses at regular intervals.

The main route to South went from Ujjayini to city of
Pratiṣṫhāna, in N.-W. Deccan, capital of Sātavāhana empire
around beginning of Christian era. Thence it passed across the
Deccan Plateau to lower Kistna, and went on to great southern cities
of Kāñcī (Conjeeveram) and Madurai. network of roads developed early
in Christian era from this old route, linking all more important cities
of Peninsula. Contact between North and South by way of east does
not at first seem to hv been close or frequent, but routes from Pataliputra
to Orissa must hv existed before Mauryan period. In more
unsettled times after Mauryas wild uncivilized forests of Central
India much discouraged travel, and western route was most
important until at least Gupta period.

The larger rivers crossed en route by these roads were not bridged. Indian
engineering, though very competent in many respects, seems never to have
mastered art of bridging large river; but regular ferry services, in
Mauryan times regulated by State, were maintained at every important
crossing.

European visitors to Mughal Empire in 17th century, were
impressed by badness of roads, which were atrocious even by the
low Western standards of time. As road builders Indians never
equalled Romans, but references in Asoka’s inscriptions, the
Arthaśāstra and elsewhere, show that under more energetic governments
roads were well maintained, and conditions under Mughals may not
have been typical of earlier times. medieval text on statecraft attributed
to Sukra tells of main roads forty-five feet wide, which were cambered, had
drains at both sides, and were regularly repaired with gravel.29
In rainy season, roughly corresponding to European summer, the
roads were practically impassable; rivers in spate could not be ferried, and
all travelling ceased; even thousands of wandering religious mendicants,
who walked length and breadth of India from one shrine to another,
would settle down until rains had passed, in precincts of temple,
the outhouse of kindly patron, or cave near village. But at other times
of year, especially in cool, bright winter, when weather of
Northern India resembles rainless late May in England, long caravans of
rumbling [Page 225] bullock carts and pack animals—oxen, asses, mules
and camels—travelled dusty roads.

The roads were dangerous to merchant-caravans. Many of trade
routes linking centres of civilization passed through dense jungle, and over
hills where wild tribes dwelt. There were whole villages of professional
robbers, ready at all times to waylay merchant. Other dangers were
incurred from wild beasts—tigers, elephants and snakes in particular-and
the remoter parts of country were reputed haunts of demons of many
malevolent kinds. In these circumstances merchants preferred to share their
perils together, and we read of as many as 500 men travelling in caravan.

Pali literature tells. of bands of professional caravan guards, who would
undertake to give guidance and safe conduct over specified route, and
who seem to hv been regular feature of caravan trade, at least where
the merchant corporations did not provide their own guards. If the
Arthaśāstra’s instructions on duties of antapāla (p. 108) hv any
relation to facts it would seem that Mauryan kings did much to
safeguard roads, and same is true of many other important dynasties;
but danger that beset caravans from thieves is attested by many stories,
and by enormous rate of interest which Arthaśāstra permits on loans
to finance long distance trading ventures.

The caravan leader (sārthavāha) was an important figure in the
commercial community, and Gupta copper-plates of Northern Bengal
(p. 103) show that chief caravan leader of locality might occupy an
important place on district council. Another figure associated with the
caravan trade was land-pilot (in Pali, thalaniyyāmaka), whose existence
is attested in Pali scriptures; he guided caravans through deserts and
waste places, steering by stars.

The great rivers were used to carry both goods and passengers in vessels
large and small. Chief of these was Ganges, artery of Great
Plain, but Indus and rivers of Deccan were also important as
trade routes. Like land routes they were full of dangers: river pirates
were numerous, and in some rivers sandbanks, and in others submerged
rocks, were peril to navigators.

Luxury articles formed chief objects of long-distance trade—spices,
sandal-wood, gold and gems from South, silks and muslins from Bengal
and Banaras, musk, saffron and yaks’ tails from Hills; but these were
not only merchandise of caravans. Many regions had to import
metal. chief source of iron in India was South Bihār, and control of the
route from iron producing areas around modern Rānchī to the
Ganges may well hv been one of [Page 226] chief factors in early
rise of Magadhan power. Copper was mined and smelted in various parts of
the Deccan, in Rajasthan, and in Western Himalayas. Salt, an absolute
necessity in hot climate, was imported from sea coast, and from
various rock-salt deposits, notably in Salt Range in Panjāb. Certain
foodstuffs were articles of long-distance commerce: sugar was carried to
cooler and dryer regions where cane would not grow, and rice imported
as luxury food to parts of North-West.



SEA-TRADE AND OVERSEAS CONTACTS
Whether or not Āryans of Ṛg Vedic period knew sea, by the
time of Buddha hardy sailors had probably circumnavigated sub-
continent, and perhaps made first contacts with Burma, Malaya and the
islands of Indonesia. In early centuries of Christian era maritime
trade became most vigorous, especially with West, where Roman
Empire demanded luxuries of East in great quantities. With fall
of Roman Empire trade with West declined somewhat, though it
was maintained by Arabs, and improved gradually with rising
material standards of medieval Europe. Before time of Guptas
contact was made by sea between South India and China, and as trade with
the West declined that with China increased, Chinese demand for Indian
spices, jewels, perfumes, and other luxury commodities continuing down to
the present day.

Certain over-enthusiastic Indian scholars hv perhaps made too much of
the achievements of ancient Indian seafarers, which cannot compare with
those of Vikings, or of some other early maritime peoples. Much of the
merchandise exported from India was carried in foreign bottoms, and
though Indian literature mentions ships carrying 1,000 passengers this
seems certainly an exaggeration. largest Indian ship known to Pliny,
who obtained some accurate information about maritime trade of the
Indian Ocean, measured 3,000 amphorae, or only seventy-five tons. In the
5th century Fahsien, who had no reason not to tell truth in this respect,
travelled from Ceylon to Java in ship carrying 200 people, which is the
largest complement of passengers and crew attested in reliable source
relating to early India. few illustrations of ships surviving from this
period give little impression of size, though one, at Ajanta, has three masts
(fig. xvii); and vessels so vigorously and realistically depicted on the
friezes of great Buddhist temple of Barabudur in Java, r all small, the
largest containing only fifteen people. All hv steadying outriggers, like
the fishing boats of present-day [Page 227] South India and Ceylon, and all
are steered by large oars—the rudder was unknown in our period.


Normally timbers of ancient Indian ships were not nailed or riveted,
but lashed together; this was done to avoid imaginary danger of
magnetic rocks, for technique of nailing ship’s timbers was certainly
known in India in medieval period. In fact sewn or lashed timbers were
more resilient than nailed ones, and could stand up better to fierce
storms of monsoon period and many coral reefs of Indian Ocean.

An early Jātaka story30 tells of ships sailing from port of
Bhrgukaccha to place called Baveru, which must be Babylon. Pali
Questions of Milinda, probably of 1st century A.D., mentions the
possibility of merchant sailing to Alexandria, Burma, Malaya or China. A
story of 6th or 7th century, tells of merchant’s son who sailed to “the
Island of Black Yavanas” 31, which must surely be Madagascar or
Zanzibar. These records indicate limits of Indian seafaring.


Fig. xvii.—A ship, c. 6th century, A.D. (From Cave II Ajantā). (By permission of Oxford
University Press).

The chief ports of ancient India were on West Coast—Bhrgukaccha,
already mentioned, Supara, not far from modern Bombay, and Patala, on
the Indus delta. Hence coastal shipping plied to South and to Ceylon,
and westwards to Persian Gulf and Red Sea until, in 1st century
A.D., seamen took to using monsoon winds to sail straight across the
Indian Ocean to ports of South India. In East Ganges Basin was
served by river port of Campa, from which ships sailed down the
Ganges and coasted to [Page 228] South and Ceylon. By Mauryan
times, with eastward expansion of Āryan culture, Tamralipti became the
main seaport of Ganges basin, and Campa lost its importance. From
Tāmraliptī ships not only sailed to Ceylon, but, from before beginning
of Christian era, to South-East Asia and Indonesia.

The merchants and seamen of Roman Egypt knew India well, and there
survives remarkable seaman’s guide, compiled in Greek by an anonymous
author towards end of 1st century A.D., Periplus of Erythrean
Sea. From Periplus, Ptolemy’s Geography, of following century,
and early Tamil poems which look back to this period, we learn much of
the trade of Tamil lands. Here many flourishing ports r mentioned, the
three chief being Musiri, known to Greeks as Musiris, in Cera
country (Malabar), Korkai, in land of Pāṇḍyas, not far from the
modern Tuticorin, and Kavirippattinam, chief port of Cō country,
at mouth of Kaviri.

The Tamil kings did much to develop their harbours and encourage sea-
trade. We read of lighthouses, and wharves, where “the beautiful great ships
of Yavanas” discharged their merchandise to be examined by customs
officials, stamped with king’s seal, and stored in warehouses.

Kavirippattinam, now decaying fishing village silted up by river mud,
had an artificial harbour, built, acc to late Sinhalese source, by
soldiers captured by great King Karikālaṉ in raid on Ceylon.32
At this time Socotra had considerable Indian colony, and name of
the island may be of Indian origin. 6 Indian merchants were met by Dion
Chrysostom in Alexandria. One such merchant, crossing desert from the
Red Sea to Nile on his way to Alexandria, left brief inscription in a
temple at Redesiye; “Sophon Indian does homage to Pan for good
journey”. 33 “Sophon” probably represents some such Indian name as
Subhanu, and Pan was no doubt identified in merchant’s mind with
Kṛṣṇa, who was also god of flocks and herds, and played rustic flute. It
is evident that author of this inscription was much Hellenized.

As well as merchants, we read of Indian fortune-tellers, conjurors, and
prostitutes in Rome, while mahouts often accompanied their elephants to
the West. There r records of several embassies from Indian kings to the
Caesars. earliest of these is said by Strabo to hv been sent by king
of Pāṇḍyas, and was met by Augustus at Athens about 20 B.C. This
mission included an ascetic called Zarmanochegas (Skt. Śramaṇācārya),
who, growing tired of [Page 229] life of earthly bondage, burnt himself to
death at Athens. It has been suggested that when St. Paul wrote “though I
give my body to be burned, and hv not charity, it profiteth me nothing”,
he had in mind this incident of some sixty or seventy years earlier, of which
he had heard from his Athenian colleagues. theory is, of course,
fanciful, but not wholly impossible. Later embassies r recorded as having
been sent to Claudius (from Ceylon), Trajan, Antoninus Pius, Julian the
Apostate and Justinian. latter emperor of Constantinople had an Indian
cook.

The main requirements of West were spices, perfumes, jewels and
fine textiles, but lesser luxuries, such as sugar, rice and ghee were also
exported, as well as ivory, both raw and worked. finely carved ivory
statuette of goddess or yaksi has been found in ruins of Herculaneum
(pl. LXXXVIIb). Indian iron was much esteemed for its purity and
hardness, and dyestuffs such as lac and indigo were also in demand.

Another requirement was live animals and birds; elephants, lions, tigers and
buffaloes were exported from India in appreciable numbers for wild
beast shows of Roman emperors and provincial governors, though these
larger beasts went mainly overland through desert trading city of
Palmyra; smaller animals and birds, such as monkeys, parrots and peacocks,
found their way to Rome in even larger quantities as pets of wealthy Roman
ladies. Emperor Claudius even succeeded in obtaining from India a
specimen of fabulous phoenix, probably golden pheasant, one of the
loveliest of India’s birds.

In return for her exports India wanted little but gold. Pottery and
glassware from West found their way to India, and many sherds of
Arretine and other wares, mass-produced in Western factories, hv been
found in remains of trading station at Arikamedu, near Pondicherry.34
There was some demand for wine, and Western traders also brought tin,
lead, coral and slave-girls. But balance of trade was very unfavourable
to West, and resulted in serious drain of gold from Roman Empire.

This was recognized by Pliny, who, inveighing against degenerate
habits of his day, computed annual drain to East as 100 million
sesterces, “so dearly do we pay for our luxury and our women”. 35 drain


of gold to East was an important cause of financial difficulties in the
Roman Empire from reign of Nero onwards. Not only gold, but coinage
of all types was exported to India; Roman coinage has been found in such
quantities in many parts of Peninsula and Ceylon that it must have
circulated there as regular currency.

There is good evidence that subjects of Roman Empire, if not actual
Romans, settled in India. There is mention of temple of [Page 230]
Emperor Augustus at Muśiṟi. Early Tamil literature contains several
references to Yavanas, who were employed as bodyguards by Tamil
kings, or as engineers, valued for their knowledge of siegecraft and the
construction of war-engines. While term Yavana was often used very
vaguely, and, from its original meaning of “a Greek”, came to be applied to
any Westerner, it is by no means impossible that Yavanas of South India
included fugitives from Roman legions in their number.

Contacts between India and West r testified in language. Even a
few Hebrew words r believed by some to be of Indian origin-notably
koph, “a monkey” (Skt. kapi) and tukki, “a peacock”, (Tamil togai). Though
the details of Book of Kings may not be historically accurate the
statement that navy of Tharshish brought to King Solomon gold and
silver, ivory, apes and peacocks36 shows that Hebrews received
commodities from India at an early period. It has been suggested that the
land of Ophir, from which King Hiram of Tyre brought gold, precious
stones and “almug” trees to Solomon, 37 was Supara, ancient port near
Bombay; this suggestion is strengthened by fact that in Septuagint,
the Greek version of Old Testament, word occurs as
; the
almug trees may hv been sandal, one of Sanskrit words for which is
valguka, from which Hebrew word may be derived. Indian loan-words
in Greek and Latin r nearly all of articles of trade: precious stones, such
as
, emerald (Skt. marakaṭa)7 and
, beryl (Skt. vaidurya);
spices, such as
, ginger (Skt. śṛṅ gavera) and
, pepper (Skt.

pippali); foodstuffs, such as, sugar (Skt. śarkara) and
rice (Tamil
ariśi); and
, cotton (Skt. karpāśa) as well as several others.

Dubious is suggested etymology of word, elephant, from the
Sanskrit ibha, meaning elephant, with Semitic definite article al or el
prefixed.



Greek loan-words in Sanskrit include several connected with
mathematics and astronomy, of which some r common, and hv passed
into vernaculars of India:
horā, an hour (
), kendra, centre (
) and kona, angle (
); two coins, dramma and dīnāra (from the
Latin denarius, through Greek); and two words connected with war,
suranga, mine (see p. 135), and kampana, camp (a rare word used in
Kashmir, and borrowed from Latin through Greek); of words connected
with writing melā, ink (
), and kalama, pen (
) r certain
borrowings, though there r synonyms of purely Indian origin for both
these words. derivation of pustaka, book, from Greek
, is no
longer supported by competent authorities.

[Page 231] Chinese in Middle Ages demanded many of same
commodities as Westerners, but they had more to offer in exchange.

Though Indians made splendid silks and muslins of their own they were
ready to buy stuffs of China, and Chinese porcelain found market in
South India and Ceylon, as did pottery of Muslim World, numerous
sherds of which hv been found.

Though maritime trade never ceased it became more and more affair
of foreign merchants. Indians never wholly abandoned sea, but by the
time of Muslim invasion travel to foreign lands was believed to incur
grave impurity for members of upper classes, which, acc to some
authorities, could never be expunged. 38 This religious objection to sea
travel was measure of growing fear of and distaste for sea, which
in some degree existed at all times. Though Indian mariners were
resourceful and by no means lacking in courage, sailing sea was always
depicted as hateful and desperately perilous. By Middle Ages Arabs
and Chinese had outstripped Indians in art of ship construction, and
it became more profitable for merchant to sell his wares to foreign
middlemen than to take dm abroad himself. Muslim invasions
encouraged xenophobia, and people who had planted their colonies
from Socotra to Borneo became, with religious sanction, nation of
landlubbers.

RELIGION: CULTS, DOCTRINES AND
METAPHYSICS


(1) RELIGION OF VEDAS
Gods of Gods of Ṛ g Veda
[Page 232]
THE earliest civilized inhabitants of India worshipped Mother Goddess
and horned fertility god; they had sacred trees and animals, and ritual
ablutions apparently played an important part in their religious life. Beyond
this much has been said and written about religion of Harappā
people, but in absence of intelligible texts any efforts at further defining
it r very speculative. salient features of Harappā religion appeared
again in new form at much later date, and we must assume that it never
died, but was quietly practised by humbler people, gradually developing
from contact with other doctrines and cults, until it gathered enough
strength to reappear, and largely to overlay old faith of Āryan rulers
of India.

We hv much knowledge of religion of early Āryans from the
1028 hymns of Ṛ g Veda, which is oldest religious text in world
still looked on as sacred, and which was probably composed between 1500
and 900 B.C. The. Ṛ g Veda is collection of hymns for use at sacrifices
of aristocratic Āryan cult. three later Vedas, Sāma, Yajur and
Atharva, r of somewhat different character. Sāma Veda is almost
useless to historian, being collection of certain verses of Ṛ g Veda
arranged for liturgical purposes. Yajur Veda, compiled century or two
later than Ṛ g Veda, contains sacrificial formulæ in prose and verse to be
pronounced by adhvaryu, or priest who performs manual part of the
sacrifice. It exists in various recensions (saṃhitā), which r of two types,
the “Black” giving formulæ with rubricated instructions, and the
“White” adding detailed instructions in lengthy appendix called a
Brāhmaṇa. Atharva Veda consists mainly of magical spells and
incantations in verse, and was certainly compiled after Rg and Tajur. It
possesses, however, an atmosphere of simple animism and sympathetic
magic on lower cultural level than that of Ṛ g Veda, deriving from the
plebeian religion of Āryans and containing many non-Āryan elements.

The massive [Page 233] Brāhmaṇas, which r looked on as appendices to
the Vedas, and mystical Araṇ yakas and Upanisads, which r in turn
appendices to Brāhmaṇas, complete literature generally known as
Vedic. material in Brāhmaṇas looks back in main to period
between c. 800 and 600 B.C., and earliest Upanisads overlap with the
latest Brāhmaṇas, though some Upanisads r certainly of much more
recent date. religion of people who composed this literature was not
that of later India, and many scholars refer to it as Brāhmaṇism or Vedism,
to distinguish it from Hinduism, to which it bears relation similar to that
between sacrificial Judaism of temple and later Judaism of the
synagogue.

PLATE LIV
Much of Ṛ g Veda is imperfectly understood; oldest exegetical
work on it, Nirukta (Etymology) of Yaska, perhaps dating from 500 B.C.,
shows that at very early period brāhmaṇs had forgotten true
meaning of many obsolete words. But broad outlines of religion of
the Ṛ g Veda r clear enough. chief objects of worship were devas,
a word cognate with Latin deus. root from which this word is
derived, div, is connected with brightness and radiance, and devas by
connotation were “the shining ones”. early gods of Āryans, like
those of Greeks, were chiefly connected with sky and were
predominantly male. few goddesses occur in Ṛ g Veda; for instance
Pṛ thvī, vague and rarely mentioned personification of earth, Aditi, a
mysterious and tenuous figure, great mother of gods, Usas, the
goddess of dawn, to whom number of lovely hymns were addressed,
Rātrī, spirit of night, who has beautiful hymn to herself (p. 402),
and Araṇ yāni, Lady of Forest, nature goddess of little importance
who is praised in one very late hymn (p. 402f); none of these, however,
played significant part in cult.

At remote period ancestors of Āryans, Iranians, Greeks,
Romans, Germans, Slavs and Celts had similar, if not identical, religions;
but by time Āryans had entered India their religion had developed
far from old Indo-European faith. great father god of Indo-
European peoples, who appears in Greek as Zeus and in Latin as Ju-piter,
was known to Āryans as Dyaus, personified heavens, but his star
had already set. Father Heaven was often mentioned as parent of other
divinities, but few hymns were composed in his honour, and he was
eclipsed by his children.

From point of view of Āryan warrior greatest god was Indra,
who fulfilled dual function of war-god and weather-god. Though his
name was different he had many of characteristics of Greek Zeus
and Germanic Thor. As Indra tonans he rode [Page 234] at head of
the Āryan host, and destroyed fortresses of Dasas; as Indra pluvius
he slew evil dragon Vrtra, who held back waters, and thus brought
rain to parched land (p. 400ff). Indra was associated with storm and
thunder, and, like Zeus and Thor, his hand bore thunderbolt ( vajra), with
which he destroyed his enemies. He was rowdy amoral deity, fond of
feasting and drinking. One hymn, acc to usual interpretation,
shows us drunken Indra, bragging in his cups, though it may well
represent feelings of worshipper who has drunk liberally of sacred
drink soma:
“Like wild winds
the draughts hv raised me up. hv I been drinking soma?

“The draughts hv borne me up,
as swift steeds chariot. hv I …?

“Frenzy has come upon me,
as cow to her dear calf. hv I … ?

“As carpenter bends seat of chariot
I bend this frenzy round my heart. hv I … ?

“Not even as mote in my eye
do five tribes count with me. hv I … ?

“The heavens above
do not equal one half of me. hv I … ?

“In my glory I hv passed beyond sky
and great earth. hv I … ?

“I will pick up earth,
and put it here or put it there. hv I … ?” 1
With Indra in his course across sky rode bright host of Maruts in
their chariots, singing martial songs as they aided war-god in his battles.

They were lesser spirits of storm, conceived on analogy of the
host of Āryan warriors charging into battle beside their leader. Āryans
evidently had many legends in which Indra was protagonist, but none of
them cn be reconstructed in detail from cryptic allusions of hymns.

Two of his traits connect him with Indo-European mythology, for they were
applied to various gods and heroes throughout ancient Europe—Indra was a
dragon-slayer, and wild rider of storm. former feature of his
character may hv been very early borrowing from Mesopotamia.

Several gods were associated with sun. Sśrya (the common word for
sun) drove across sky in flaming chariot, like Greek Helios. Savitṛ,
the Stimulator, was another solar god, beautiful [Page 235] verse in whose
honour is most holy of all verses of Veda (p. 162). Pūṣ an too
was in some measure solar god, driving daily across sky, but his main
function was that of guardian of roads, herdsmen and straying cattle. Viṣṇ u,
a god connected in part with sacrifice, also had solar characteristics,
covering earth in three paces, trait which he retained in later
Hinduism, when his importance greatly increased. On fringes of the
solar pantheon was Sūryā, sun-god’s daughter, who seems never to have
been worshipped, but merely served to connect her two husbands, the
Aṣ vins (“Horsemen” also called Nāsatyas), with sun; these are
described as driving across sky in their three-wheeled chariot, but in the
hymns they r not closely associated with natural phenomena. They are
twins-a fact which connects dm with Greek Dioscuri and twin gods of
pre-Christian Baltic mythology. Aśvins appear chiefly as helpers of
men; among their many good deeds they r said to hv rescued
shipwrecked mariners, provided artificial legs for maimed, and found
husbands for old maids.

The fire-god, Agni (which means simply “fire”, and is related to Latin
ignis), was object of much primitive mysticism and speculation. He was
the god of priest, who dealt with him at fire-sacrifice; he was also
the god of home, for he dwelt in domestic hearth; he was the
intermediary between gods and men, for he consumed sacrifice and
carried it to gods. He dwelt in waters of heaven, in form of
lightning, and on earth in many forms. He was hidden in fire-sticks,
with which sacrificial fire was kindled, and which were personified as
his parents. Agni, in fact, was here, there and everywhere. Was there only
one Agni, or were there many Agnis? How could Agni be one and many at
the same time? Questions like these r asked in Ṛ g Veda, and show the
earliest signs of tendency towards monism, which was to bear fruit in
the Upaniṣads.

Soma was divinity of special character. Soma was originally plant, not
certainly identified, from which potent drink was produced, which was
drunk only at sacrifices, and which caused most invigorating effects, as
we hv seen from hymn quoted above. Zoroastrians of Persia had
a similar drink, which they called haoma, same word as soma in its
Iranian form; plant identified with haoma by modern Pārsīs is a
bitter herb, which has no specially inebriating qualities, and which cannot
have been soma of Veda. drink prepared from plant can
scarcely hv been alcoholic, for it was made with great ceremony in the
course of sacrifice, when herb was pressed between stones, mixed
with milk, strained and drunk on same day. Sugar and honey, [Page 236]
which produce fermentation, were not usually mixed with it, and brief
period between its brewing and consumption cannot hv been long enough
for generation of alcohol in appreciable quantity. effects of soma,
with vivid hallucinations, and sense of expanding to enormous
dimensions, r rather like those attributed to such drugs as hashish. Soma
may well hv been hemp, which grows wild in many parts of India,
Central Asia and South Russia, and from which modern Indians produce a
narcotic drink called bhang.

Like many ancient peoples Indians connected growth of plants
with moon, with which Soma, king of plants, was later identified. So
important was god Soma considered by ancient editors of Ṛ g
Veda that they extracted all hymns in his honour and placed dm in a
separate “book” ( maṇḍ ala), ninth of ten which constitute whole.

Varuna, second only to Indra in importance, was god of type rather
different from others. He is known as an Asura, term, also applied to
certain lesser gods, which in later Hinduism came to mean class of
demons, but which was in Persia adopted by reformer Zarathustra in its
local form as part of title of great god of light, Ahura Mazda. Just as
the shadowy Dyaus represents high god of Indo-European peoples
before their separation, so Varuna may hv been high god of Indo-
Iranians before two peoples divided, one to settle in N.-W. India and the
other in Persian highlands. name is connected by some authorities
with shadowy Greek heaven-god Uranus. At time of the
composition of Veda, Varuna’s prestige was waning before that of Indra,
but he retained some importance for many centuries.

Varuna was first and foremost king-not boisterous tribal warlord, like
Indra, but mighty emperor, sitting in great palace in heavens, often
with associated gods around him. Most important of these was Mitra, god
with some solar characteristics, but mainly connected with vows and
compacts. Mitra was also represented in Zoroastrian pantheon, and,
under his Greco-Iranian name Mithras, was widely worshipped in the
Roman Empire during early Christian centuries. Around Varuna sat his
scouts, or spies ( spas), who flew all over world, and brought back
reports on conduct of mortals.

Varuna was guardian of Rta, cosmic order, concept which was
perhaps highest flight of Ṛg Vedic thought. world takes its regular
course, day follows night and season succeeds season, because of Rta; man
must live acc to Rta; in later days “nonrta” ( anrta) became one of the
commonest words for untruth and [Page 237] sin. Rta depended on Varuna,
who was sometimes looked on as its maker, and was thus sort of creator-
god.

Of all Āryan gods Varuna was ethically highest. He was always
aware of deeds of men, and was omnipresent, in theistic, as opposed
to pantheistic sense. Two men, even in most secret of places, or at
the ends of earth, cannot make plans alone-a third person, Varuna, is
always there.2 worshipper approached Varuna in spirit different from
that in which he prayed to other gods, most of whom were lively,
cheerful fellows, whom men need not fear if they offered regular sacrifices.

Varuna was so pure and holy that mere performance of sacrifice would
not ensure his favour, for he abhorred sin, or that which was not
conformable to Rta. idea of sin included many purely ritual sins and
breaches of taboo, but it also certainly included lying, which Varuna and
Mitra particularly loathed, and evil deeds prompted by anger, drink,
gambling, and influence of wicked men. When he sang to Varuna the
cheerful Vedic poet often put on sackcloth and ashes, and prayed to his
deity with fear and trembling, for Varuna was severe punisher of sin.

Not only did Varuna punish sins of individual but, like Yahweh
of Old Testament, he visited sins of his ancestors upon him, and his
ubiquity ensured that there was no escape for sinner. He caught and
bound evil-doers in his snares, so that they became diseased, especially with
dropsy, and when they died they descended to “House of Clay”,
apparently sort of gloomy subterranean Sheol, very different from the
cheerful “World of Fathers”, Āryan heaven.

So humble was worshipper in Varuna’s presence, so conscious of
weakness, guilt and shortcoming, that on reading hymns to Varuna one
is inevitably reminded of penitential psalms of Old Testament. It has
even been suggested that Varuna owes much of his character to Semitic
influence—certainly not to Jews, for penitential psalms were
composed long after hymns to Varuna, and as far as we know early
Hebrews never came in contact with Āryans, but perhaps to the
Babylonians, who often approached their gods in similar penitential spirit.

We quote typical hymn to Varuṇa; it is obviously prayer of man
afflicted with dropsy.

“Let me not go to House of Clay, O Varuṇa!

Forgive, O gracious Lord, forgive!

When I go tottering, like blown-up bladder,
forgive, O gracious Lord, forgive!

[Page 238] “Holy One, in want of wisdom I hv opposed you.

Forgive, O gracious Lord, forgive!

Though in midst of waters, thirst has seized your worshipper.

Forgive, O gracious Lord, forgive!

“Whatever sin we mortals hv committed
against people of gods,
if, foolish, we hv thwarted your decrees,
O god, do not destroy us in your anger!”3
Tama, lord of dead, was sort of Adam, first man to die, who
became guardian of World of Fathers, where blessed dead, those
who hv performed rites of Āryans, feast in bliss forever.

Rudra (perhaps meaning “the Howler”), like Varuṇa, had dangerous
side to his character, but, unlike Varuna, was quite amoral. He was an
archer-god, whose arrows brought disease. In this he resembled Greek
Apollo. Like Indra, he was associated with storm, but he lacked Indra’s
popular and genial character. He was remote god, dwelling in the
mountains, and was generally an object of fear, invoked to ward off his
arrows of plague and disaster. He had, however, beneficent aspect, for he
was guardian of healing herbs, and as such might give health to those whom
he capriciously favoured.

There were many other gods, such as Tvaṣṭṛ, Vedic Vulcan,
Aryaman, guardian of compacts and marriage, and Vāyu, windgod, who,
though important, cannot be described here. There were also demigods of
various kinds, among dm Viśvedevas, vague group of indeterminate
deities, Maruts, or storm-spirits, already mentioned, Rbhus, gnomes
who worked in metal, Gandharvas, divine musicians, originally single
divinity but later looked on as many, and lovely Apsarases, comparable
to nymphs of Greece, who might become mistresses of gods and
men.



No Homer or Hesiod attempted to construct definitive genealogy of all
these gods; their relationships r usually vague, and there is no tidy
scheme of precedence among them. Each god must hv had his own
special devotees and priests, and Ṛ g Veda is result of an imperfect
syncretism of many tribal beliefs and cults. Already in latest stratum of
the Vedic hymns gods r equated or paired together, and there r doubts
as to which god is really greatest. In one hymn4 this important question
is asked as refrain to every verse— “Whom, then, shall we honour with
our oblations?”; later theologians were so puzzled by this that they decided
that there was god called Ka (Who?), to whom hymn was addressed.

[Page 239]
Sacrifice
The centre of Āryan cult was sacrifice. cult of domestic
hearth existed in many ancient Indo-European communities, and small
domestic sacrifices, performed by head of house, must hv been as
important in days of Ṛ g Veda as they were in later Hinduism, but the
earliest texts describing dm r Grhya Sśtras (p. 112) of much more
recent period. Ṛ g Veda is rather concerned with great sacrifices, paid
for by chiefs and wealthier tribesmen. They were already complex rites
involving much preparation, slaughter of numerous animals, and the
participation of several well-trained priests.

The chief purpose of sacrifice was gratification of gods in
order to obtain boons from them. gods descended to sacred straw
( barhis) on sacrificial field, drank and ate with worshippers, and
duly rewarded dm with success in war, progeny, increase of cattle, and
long life, on quid pro quo basis. solemn Varuna and grim and
unpredictable Rudra r exceptional in Vedic pantheon. Most of the
gods were good natured. Guilt-offerings and thank-offerings, of kind
offered by ancient Hebrews, r almost unheard of in Veda.

Nevertheless ceremony must hv had its element of awe and
wonder. worshippers, inebriated with soma, saw wondrous visions of
the gods; they experienced strange sensations of power; they could reach up
and touch heavens; they became immortal; they were gods themselves.

The priests, who alone knew rituals whereby gods were brought to
the sacrifice, were masters of great mystery. With these ideas, which are
explicitly stated in hymns, went others less obvious. Often in Ṛ g
Veda we read of mysterious entity called brahman; in some contexts
brahman is magical power in sacred utterance ( mantra), but often it
has wider connotation, and implies sort of supernatural electricity,
known to students of primitive religion as mana. possessor of brahman,
by common process of secondary word formation in Sanskrit, became
known as Brāhmaṇ a, 1 tribal priest and magician. In later Vedic times
the connection of brahman with speech became more and more pronounced,
and brahman’s magic was thought to lie in words he uttered. The
words and syllables of Veda were analysed, and, though texts were
still unwritten, letters of alphabet were recognized and personified
as eternal divinities. metres used in Veda were also thought of as
gods. Later certain syllables were believed to be particularly holy,[Page
240] notably Ṓ M (the praṇ ava), which contains essence of Vedas
and is pregnant with utmost power and mystery.

A second conception, which is hinted at in many hymns of Ṛ g Veda,
and becomes prominent in latest stratum, is also widely known in
primitive religions-the mystical identification of god, victim and sacrificer.

From these ideas sacrifice developed an even greater importance in the
scheme of things than it had had in earliest period of Ṛ g Veda. By
the end of period it was widely believed that universe itself arose
from primeval sacrifice.

Though Varuna may hv been sometimes looked on as sort of creator,
and there r suggestions of Indra’s having fulfilled same function (p.

400), there is no clearly defined creator-god in main body of Ṛ g
Veda. By end of Ṛg Vedic period, however, such god had
developed, whether wholly from speculations of brāhmaṇs or from
non-Āryan influences. This god was Prajāpati, “the Lord of Beings”, later
called Brahmā, masculine form of neuter brahman. Prajapati was
thought of as primeval man ( puruṣ a), who existed before foundation
of universe. man was sacrificed, presumably to himself, by the
gods, who apparently were his children. 2 From body of divine
victim universe was produced. great “Hymn of Primeval Man”,
in which first cosmic sacrifice is described, bristles with obscurities, but
its purport is quite clear.

“When gods made sacrifice
with Man as their victim,
Spring was melted butter, Summer fuel,
and Autumn oblation.

“From that all-embracing sacrifice
the clotted butter was collected.

From it he3 made animals
of air and wood and village.

“From that all-embracing sacrifice
were born hymns and chants,
from that metres were born,
from that sacrificial spells were born.

“Thence were born horses,
and all beings with two rows of teeth.

Thence were born cattle,
and thence goats and sheep.

[Page 241] “When they divided Man,
into how many parts did they divide him?

What was his mouth, what were his arms,
what were his thighs and his feet called?

“The brahman was his mouth,
of his arms was made warrior,
his thighs became vaiśya,
of his feet śūdra was born.”
“The moon arose from his mind,
from his eye was born sun,
from his mouth Indra and Agni,
from his breath wind was born.

“From his navel came air,
from his head there came sky,


from his feet earth, four quarters from his ear,
thus they fashioned worlds.

“With Sacrifice gods sacrificed to Sacrifice—
these were first of sacred laws.

These mighty beings reached sky,4
where r eternal spirits, gods.”5
By this time new attitude to sacrifice had developed, and it had
become supernal mystery. By means of it priests mystically repeated
the primeval sacrifice, and world was born anew. Without regular
sacrifices all cosmic processes would cease, and chaos would come again.

Thus order of nature was on ultimate analysis not dependent on gods
at all, but on brāhmaṇs, who by magic of sacrifice maintained
and compelled them. brahman was more powerful than any earthly
king, or any god; by his accurate performance of sacrifice he maintained all
things, and was therefore supreme social servant; by slightest
variation of ritual he could turn sacrifice against his patrons and destroy
them, and was therefore most dangerous of enemies.

This is basic doctrine of Brāhmaṇ as, and it prevailed in many
Āryan communities in North India from about 900 B.C. onwards, and left its
mark on Hinduism in exaltation of brahman. In this period many of
the old gods of Ṛ g Veda lost their greatness, and became comparatively
unimportant, while others rose in popularity, notably Visnu and Rudra; the
latter was already sometimes called by epithet Śiva, “the Propitious”,
originally deprecatory euphemism.

[Page 242] New Developments of Doctrine
As Āryan culture pressed further down Ganges it absorbed new ideas
about after-life. In Ṛ g Veda fate of dead seems to hv been
finally decided when they died-they went either to “World of the
Fathers” or to “House of Clay”, where they remained indefinitely. But
in one late hymn6 it is suggested in cryptic language that they might pass to
the waters or remain in plants. This seems to be reference to
metempsychosis in crude form believed in by many primitive peoples,
according to which souls of dead pass to an animal, plant or natural
object, before being reborn in human body. Brāhmaṇ literature,
which had lost optimism of Ṛ g Veda, recognized possibility of
death even in heaven.

In Brhadāraṇ yaka Upaniṣ ad7 first form of doctrine of
transmigration is given. souls of those who hv lived lives of sacrifice,
charity and austerity, after certain obscure peregrinations, pass to World
of Fathers, paradise of Yama; thence, after period of bliss, they go
to moon; from moon they go to empty space, whence they pass to
the air, and descend to earth in rain. There they “become food,… and
are offered again in altar fire which is man, to be born again in fire
of woman”, while unrighteous r reincarnated as worms, birds or
insects. This doctrine, which seems to rest on primitive belief that
conception occurred through eating by one of parents of fruit or
vegetable containing latent soul of offspring, is put forward as rare
and new one, and was not universally held at time of composition of
the Upaniṣad. Even in days of Buddha, transmigration may not have
been believed in by everyone, but it seems to hv gained ground very
rapidly in 7th and 6th centuries B.C. Thus magnificently logical
Indian doctrines of saṃsāra, or transmigration, and karma, result of the
deeds of one life affecting next, had humble beginnings in soul theory
of quite primitive type; but even at this early period they had an ethical
content, and had attained some degree of elaboration.

In whatever way doctrine of transmigration was developed it
involved belief in repeated passage of soul from life to life, either
for all eternity or for an inestimably long time. It linked all forms of life
into single system. gods themselves must pass away, and be replaced
by other gods. As one Indra died, another was born. souls of the
departed, though now in bliss, would sooner or later pass to new abodes.

Animals, insects, and even, acc to some sects, plants, all lived under
the same law. With remarkable imaginative insight some sages taught that
even water, [Page 243] dust and air were filled with minute animalculæ, and
that these too had souls which were same, in essence, as those of men.

The whole of life thus passed through innumerable changes.

It was generally, though not universally, thought that these changes were
determined by conduct. As one behaved in present life so one’s status in
the scale of existence would in future be exalted or abased, and one’s lot be


happy or wretched. This doctrine of karma (literally “deed”) soon became
fundamental to most Indian thought. It provided satisfactory explanation
of mystery of suffering, which has troubled many thoughtful souls all
over world, and it justified manifest social inequalities of Āryan
community.

To ordinary man such doctrine might not appear distasteful, and the
fact that it quickly obtained almost universal acceptance shows that it met
in great measure ancient India’s spiritual needs. Indeed in many respects the
idea of saṃsāra, which offers infinite potentialities of new experience to
the soul, and which holds out hope even to humblest of living things and
the most evil of beings, might seem more attractive than traditional
static heaven and hell of West. But to greater minds of time the
thought of transmigration was not pleasant. Death was always terrible, and
the prospect of having to die innumerable times was not happy one. Life,
even when devoid of major sorrows, was drab and inadequate, while
continual rebirth seemed monotonously boring. growth of doctrine
of transmigration coincided with development of pessimistic ideas.

Rebirth in heaven was not enough-a way had to be found to escape the
cycle of birth and death altogether. It was found, to satisfaction of the
best minds of times, in knowledge, achieved by much meditation and
asceticism.

Asceticism
In late hymn of Ṛ g Veda 8 we read of class of holy men different
from brāhmaṇs, “silent ones” ( munis), who wear wind as a
girdle, and who, drunk with their own silence, rise on wind, and fly in
the paths of demigods and birds. muni knows all men’s thoughts,
for he has drunk of magic cup of Rudra, which is poison to ordinary
mortals. Another class, much mentioned in Atharva Veda, 9 was the
vrātya. This term, in its later broad meaning, implied an Āryan who had
fallen from faith and no longer respected Vedas; but vratya of the
Atharva Veda was priest of non-Vedic fertility cult, which involved
ritual dancing and flagellation. He travelled from place to place in cart,
with woman, whom he prostituted, and musician, who performed for
him at his rites. status and nature of vratyas r still [Page 244] not
wholly clear, but it is evident that great efforts were made to convert them
to Āryan faith, and to find room for dm in orthodox cult, and they
were probably one of chief sources of new doctrines and practices.

By time of Upanisads asceticism had become very widespread,
and it was through ascetics, rather than orthodox sacrificial priests,
that new teachings developed and spread. Some ascetics were solitary
psychopaths, dwelling in depths of forests, and suffering self-
inflicted tortures of hunger, thirst, heat, cold and rain. Others dwelt in
“penance-grounds”, on outskirts of towns, where, like some of less
reputable holy-men of later times, they would indulge in fantastic self-
torture, sitting near blazing fires in hot sun, lying on beds of thorns or
spikes, hanging for hours head downwards from branches of trees, or
holding their arms motionless above their heads until they atrophied.

Most of new developments in thought, however, came from ascetics
of less rigorous regimen, whose chief practices were mental and
spiritual exercises of meditation. Some of these dwelt alone on outskirts
of towns and villages, while others lived in groups of huts, under the
leadership of an elder. Others wandered, often in large groups, begging
alms, proclaiming their doctrines to all who wished to listen, and disputing
with their rivals. Some were completely naked, while others wore simple
garments.

The original motive of Indian asceticism was acquisition of magical
power. brāhmaṇs claimed this already, by virtue of their birth and
training, but there were other types of power, obtainable by other means. By
the time of Upanisads faith in cosmic mystery of sacrifice had
perhaps begun to wane, even among brāhmaṇs themselves. Though
sacrificial mysticism did not immediately disappear rite once more
came to be thought of as means of obtaining prosperity, long life, and
rebirth in heaven, rather than of sustaining cosmos. Indeed wealthy
patrons of sacrifices had probably always had former as their main
motive. In eastern parts of Ganges Basin brahmanism was not so
deeply entrenched as in west, and older non-Āryan currents of belief
flowed more strongly. sacrificial cult did not wholly meet needs of
these lands, where firmly founded kingdoms were growing in power, and
material civilization rapidly progressing.

The ascetic, even though his penance was of most severe type, rose
far above heights achieved by sacrificial priest. Once he had inured
his body to pain and privation immeasurable joys awaited him. hermit
of lower type had much to look forward to even on material plane—
honour and respect which as an [Page 245] ordinary man he could never
hope for, and complete freedom from worldly cares and fears. This sense of
freedom, of great load lifted from one’s shoulders by casting aside one’s
family and possessions, is evident in many passages of calm joy in the
religious literature of India. But there were greater incentives to asceticism
then these. As he advanced in his self-training hermit acquired powers
beyond those of ordinary mortals. He saw past, present and future; he
mounted heavens, and was graciously received at courts of gods,
while divinities descended to earth and visited him in his hermitage. By the
magical power acquired in his asceticism he could work miracles—he could
crumble mountains into sea; if offended, he could burn up his enemies
with glance of his eye, or cause crops of whole people to fail; if
respected, his magical power could protect great city, increase its wealth,
and defend it from famine, pestilence and invasion. In fact magic
potency, formerly ascribed to sacrifice, now began to be attributed to
asceticism. In succeeding age idea that universe was founded
and maintained through sacrifice slipped into background; in its place it
was widely believed that universe depended on penances of the
great god Śiva, meditating forever in fastnesses of Himalayas, and
on continued austerities of his human followers.

If ascetism had its charms even for less spiritual, they were still
greater for questing souls who took to life of hardship from truly
religious motives. As his mystical exercises developed his psychic faculties,
the ascetic obtained insight which no words could express. Gradually
plumbing cosmic mystery, his soul entered realms far beyond the
comparatively tawdry heavens where great gods dwelt in light and
splendour. Going “from darkness to darkness deeper yet” he solved the
mystery beyond all mysteries; he understood, fully and finally, nature of
the universe and of himself, and he reached realm of truth and bliss,
beyond birth and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil. And with this
transcendent knowledge came another realization—he was completely,
utterly, free. He had found ultimate salvation, final triumph of soul.

The ascetic who reached goal of his quest was conqueror above all
conquerors. There was none greater than he in whole universe.

The metaphysical interpretation of ascetic’s mystical knowledge
varied from sect to sect, but fundamental experience was same, and,
as has been many times pointed out, was not appreciably different from that
of Western saints and mystics, whether Greek, Jewish, Christian or
Muslim. But Indian mysticism is unique in its elaboration of techniques for
inducing ecstasy, and in complex metaphysical systems built upon
interpretations of that experience. [Page 246] Where in other religions
mysticism is of varying importance, in those of India it is fundamental.

The great development of asceticism and mysticism soon became too
strong for more earthbound and materialistic brahmanism to ignore.

Places were found for hermit and wandering ascetic in Āryan
social structure by formula of four stages of life (p. 153f), which
first appear in Dharma Sūtras. Accounts of discussions and
teachings of some of more orthodox of early mystics were collected
and added to Brāhmaṇas as Āranyakas and Upaniṣads. little later
short treatises of mystical character were composed in verse, and also
appended to Brāhmaṇas as Upaniṣads. Later still system of mystical
training, often known as yoga (“union”) (p. 325ff), was accepted as an
orthodox element of Hindu system. Indian religion had taken new
direction.

It has been suggested that development of ascetic and mystical
doctrines, especially in heterodox systems of Buddhism and Jainism,
represents reaction of warrior class to pretensions of brāhmaṇs
and to sterility of sacrificial cult. This, however, is certainly not the
whole truth. Buddha and Mahāvīra, founder of Jainism, were ksatriyas;
they proclaimed futility of sacrifice, and more than one passage in the
Buddhist scriptures may be interpreted in an anti-brahmanic sense. But
many of teachers of new doctrines were themselves brāhmaṇs. The
Upaniṣads, which represent thought of more orthodox mystics, in no
way oppose sacrificial cult, but maintain its qualified validity; and
passages speaking respectfully of brāhmaṇs r quite as frequent in the
Buddhist scriptures as those which disparage them.

There was certainly some opposition to brahmanic pretensions, and
dissatisfaction with sacrificial cult; but behind this, and growth of
pessimism, asceticism and mysticism, lay deep psychological uneasiness.

The time of which we speak was one of great social change, when old tribal


units were breaking up. feeling of group solidarity which tribe gave
was removed, and men stood face to face with world, with no refuge in
their kinsmen. Chieftains were overthrown, their courts dispersed, their
lands and tribesmen absorbed in greater kingdoms. new order was
coming into being. “[Great heroes and mighty kings] hv had to give up
their glory; we hv seen deaths of [demigods and demons]; oceans
have dried up; mountains hv crumbled; Pole Star is shaken; Earth
founders; gods perish. I am like frog in dry well”; so speaks king
in one of Upaniṣads. 10 Despite great growth of material civilization
at time hearts of [Page 247] many men were failing dm for fear of
what should come to pass upon earth. It is chiefly to this deep feeling of
insecurity that we must attribute growth of pessimism and asceticism in
the middle centuries of first millennium B.C.

Speculation and Gnosis
Asceticism was not merely means of escape from an unhappy and
unsatisfying world; it had positive aspect. It was in part inspired by a
desire for knowledge, for wisdom which four Vedas could not give.

Thus growth of asceticism is not only measure of psychological
uncertainty which was felt at time, but also of thirst for knowledge.

It is not wholly just to India to stigmatize her ancient wisdom as mere “life-
negation”.

All through first millennium B.C. intelligent minds in India were
striving for convincing explanations of cosmic mystery. In latest
phase of Ṛ g Veda poets began to wonder about creation, which was not
adequately explained by current mythology. As we hv seen, creation
was thought of by some as effect of primeval sacrifice. It was also
suggested that it was due to sort of sexual act; 11 elsewhere world was
said to hv originated in “Golden Embryo” ( Hiraṇ zyagarbha), 12 the
prototype of Cosmic Egg (p. 488) of later Hindu mythology. In one
hymn poet puts forward suggestion that world arose from
warmth ( tapas, later usually meaning penance or asceticism), and then
rather regretfully admits that he is not sure of this hypothesis, and suggests
that perhaps even high god Prajāpati does not know truth.

This wonderful “Hymn of Creation”, one of oldest surviving records
of philosophic doubt in history of world, marks development of
a high stage of abstract thinking, and it is work of very great poet,
whose evocation of mysterious chaos before creation, and of mighty
ineffable forces working in depths of primeval void, reminds us of
the cosmic phantasies of William Blake.

“Then even nothingness was not, nor existence.

There was no air then, nor heavens beyond it.

What covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping?

Was there then cosmic water, in depths unfathomed?

“Then there were neither death nor immortality,
nor was there then torch of night and day.

The One breathed windlessly and self-sustaining.

There was that One then, and there was no other.

[Page 248] “At first there was only darkness wrapped in darkness.

All this was only unillumined water.

That One which came to be, enclosed in nothing,
arose at last, born of power of heat.

“In beginning desire descended on it—
that was primal seed, born of mind.

The sages who hv searched their hearts with wisdom
know that which is is kin to that which is not.

“And they hv stretched their cord across void,
and know what was above, and what below.5
Seminal powers made fertile mighty forces.

Below was strength, and over it was impulse.

“But, after all, who knows, and who cn say
whence it all came, and how creation happened?

The gods themselves r later than creation,
so who knows truly whence it has arisen?

“Whence all creation had its origin,
he, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,
he, who surveys it all from highest heaven,
he knows-or maybe even he does not know.”13
In centuries succeeding composition of Ṛ g Veda, however,
speculation was mainly concerned with symbolism of sacrifice.

“Dawn is head of sacrificial horse, sun its eye, wind
its breath, fire its mouth; year is body of sacrificial horse,
heaven its back, sky its belly, earth its chest, four quarters its
sides… seasons its limbs, months and fortnights its joints; days
and nights r its feet, stars its bones, heavens its flesh. Its
halfdigested food is sand, its bowels rivers, its liver and lungs the
mountains, its hair plants and trees. When sun rises it is horse’s
fore-quarters, when it sets it is its hind-quarters. When horse
shakes itself it lightens; when it kicks, it thunders; when it makes
water, it rains. Sound is its voice.” 14

The symbolism of sacrifice was carried much further than this. Every
word or action of ritual was identified with some aspect of cosmos.

The intellectual ingenuity spent on this process of finding pratikas or
symbols must hv been considerable, but it was largely sterile. Yet the
questing spirit of “Hymn of Creation” never wholly disappeared, and in
the 6th century B.C. it bore fruit in [Page 249] great wave of thought which
was to alter whole religious life of India.

PLATE LVI
The early Upanisads and scriptures of Buddhism and Jainism, all of
which look back to 7th or 6th centuries B.C. (though latter were much
later in their final composition), show that there existed bewildering
variety of speculations and theories on origin of universe, nature
of soul, and kindred problems. Some of these were accepted by one or
other brahmanic school and incorporated into orthodox belief. Others were
the germinal bases of heterodox sects, two of which survive to this day, but
most of which hv long since vanished, and r only remembered in
passing references of scriptures of their opponents.

Among more orthodox teachings we find creation ascribed to self-
consciousness of primeval Person ( Puruṣ a, i.e. Prajāpati), who felt fear,
loneliness, and need of companionship. Person divided himself, and
produced wife. This couple, taking forms of animals and men, created
the whole universe. 15 idea of creation by cosmic sexual act was one
which played great part in later religious thought. theme is repeated
in various forms in later Vedic literature, in some of which tapasāthe power
derived from asceticism-is an essential feature in process of creation-a
significant shifting of emphasis from older theory that world
depended on primeval sacrifice.

Other more heterodox teachers put forward naturalistic and atheistic
cosmogonic theories. Some believed that world began as water; others
postulated fire, wind, or ether ( ākāṣ a, p. 497) as ultimate basis of the
universe. For some universe was based neither on deity nor even on an
impersonal entity, but on principle —fate ( niyati), time ( kala), nature
( svabhāva), or chance ( saṃ gati). It was suggested that world developed
not by intervention of god or forces external to it, but by process of
internal evolution or “ripening” ( pariṇ āma). Some teachers, like the
Buddha, taught that speculation on first causes was futile waste of time.

There were out-and-out pyrrhonists, denying possibility of any certain
knowledge at all, and materialists, who rejected existence of soul
and any other immaterial entity, while some teachers proclaimed that the
world was made of eternal atoms. intellectual life of India in 7th
and 6th centuries B.C. was as vigorous and pullulating as jungle after
rains.

The propagators of these doctrines, even of materialism and scepticism,
were nearly all ascetics, though literature of time mentions more
than one king who took keen interest in new ideas. Chief of these
philosopher kings were Janaka of Videha and Ajāta [Page 250] satru of
Banaras, both of whom probably lived in 7th century B.C. forest
hermits ( vānaprastha) seem to hv departed less far from Vedic orthodoxy
than wanderers (parivrājaka), who maintained bewildering variety of
doctrines. It was chiefly among former that literature of the
Upanisads developed.

The term Upanisad means literally “a session”, sitting at feet of a
master who imparts esoteric doctrines. There r said to be 108 Upanisads
altogether, but many of these r late sectarian works of little importance.

The earlier Upanisads, like great Brhadāraṣ yaka and Chāndogya,
are in prose and consist of series of short expositions of some aspect of
the new doctrines, often in form of question and answer. Upanisads
of somewhat later composition, like Kaṭ ha and Śvetāśvatara, r in
verse, and their contents r more closely integrated. Though the
speculations of Upanisads differ very considerably, their main purport is
the same. One entity, often called Brahman, term used in Ṛ g Veda to
mean magic of sacred word (p. 239), fills all space and time. This is
the ground beyond and below all forms and phenomena, and from it the
whole Universe, including gods themselves, has emerged.

The great and saving knowledge which Upanisads claim to impart
lies not in mere recognition of existence of Brahman, but in
continual consciousness of it. For Brahman resides in human soul-
indeed Brahman is human soul, is Atman, Self. When man realizes
this fact fully he is wholly freed from transmigration. His soul becomes one
with Brahman, and he transcends joy and sorrow, life and death. In sleep a
man’s spirit is set free; it wanders through universe as bird or god, it
becomes king or brahman. Beyond dreaming is dreamless sleep, where
the soul’s experiences r such that they cannot be expressed; and beyond
this again is Brahman. When he reaches Brahman, man is free.

In their struggle to express inexpressible sages of Upanisads
used imagery of every kind. Sometimes idea of soul is rather
primitive, and it is described as tiny manikin in heart; sometimes it is
said to be breath, or mysterious fluid which flows in veins; but
sometimes it is thought of as quite incorporeal and immeasurable:
“‘Fetch me fruit of banyan tree.’
“‘Here is one, sir.’
“‘Break it.’
“‘I hv broken it, sir.’
“‘What do you see?’
“‘Very tiny seeds, sir.’
[Page 251] “‘Break one.’
“‘I hv broken it, sir.’
“‘Now what do you see?’
“‘Nothing, sir.’
“‘My son,’ father said, ‘what you do not perceive is essence, and
in that essence mighty banyan tree exists. Believe me, my son, in that
essence is Self of all that is. That is True, that is Self. And you
are that Self, Śvetaketu!’”16
Here soul is inmost self of being, in no sense material, though
ideas of sort of soul-stuff, subtle matter of which soul was
composed, persisted, especially among Jainas. term Atman came to
mean indiscriminately “soul”, and “self”, which lends certain ambiguity
to many passages in Hindu scriptures.

The identity of souls of individual and universe is reiterated
throughout Upanisadic literature, with varying emphasis, and with
differing interpretations of nature of identity and character of the
universal soul. Tat tvam asi, “you (the individual) r that (universal
essence)”, words of father to son in passage we hv quoted,
is leading theme of Upaniṣads. one eternal undifferentiated
essence, above good and evil, is in condition of consciousness which is
beyond deep sleep (suṃupti), but is yet awake and living. Though it fills
the whole of space, by mysterious verity which defies logic but is proved
by experience it dwells in core of human heart. It is generally
thought of as uniform and impersonal, and word Brahman is of neuter
gender. Thus all multifariousness and incoherence of universe is
explained away, and reduced to single entity.

“‘Put this salt in water, and come to me in morning.’
“The son did as he was told. father said: ‘Fetch salt.’ The
son looked for it, but could not find it, because it had dissolved.

“‘Taste water from top,’ said father. ‘How does it taste?’
“‘Of salt,’ son replied.

“‘Taste from middle. How does it taste?’
“‘Of salt,’ son replied.

“‘Taste from bottom. How does it taste?’
“‘Of salt,’ son replied.

“Then father said: ‘You don’t perceive that one Reality (sat)
exists in your own body, my son, but it is truly there. Everything which
is has its being in that subtle essence. That is Reality! That is Soul!

And you r that, Svetaketu!’” 17

The Universal Essence is sometimes defined in purely negative terms.

“The Self cn only be described as ‘Not this, not this’. It [Page 252] is
incomprehensible, imperishable, … unattached, … unfettered,… it does not
suffer, … it does not fail.” 18 But, despite negations of this passage, the
sage Yājñavalkya, to whom it is attributed, could not escape giving the
Universal Essence degree of personality, and in one place almost
identified it with High God.

“That great unborn Self, comprised of knowledge, is … ether in the
heart. In that is ruler and lord, king of all things. He grows no
greater by good deeds, nor smaller by evil deeds, but he is lord of all
things, king of all things, protector of all things.”19
In verse Upanisads World Spirit is described rather as god than
as cosmic essence.

“He encircles all things, radiant and bodyless,
unharmed, and untouched by evil,
All-seeing, all-wise, all-present, self-existent,
he has made all things well for ever and ever.” 20
In Upanisad from which this is taken World Spirit is referred to as
Īśa, “the Lord”. Katha Upanisad calls Spirit “the Person” ( Puruṣ a),
reminding us of divine victim of primeval sacrifice from which the
world was born. In one passage World Spirit is mentioned with fear and
dread, recalling that earlier felt for god Varuna:
“All things whatever, whole world,
produced [from Brahman] tremble in its breath.

It is great terror, an upraised thunderbolt.

They who know this become immortal.

“From terror [of Brahman] Fire burns.

From terror [of Brahman] Sun shines.

From fear of Brahman Indra, and Wind,
and Death as fifth all run away.”21
The Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣ ad, which is later than those previously
mentioned, describes World Spirit in completely theistic terms. It is no
longer an impersonal essence, but creator god—in fact god Rudra, or
Siva. Rudra may be reached not only by meditation and penance, but also
by devotion and worship.

“The snarer, who rules alone in his might,
he who governs world in his power,
is always one and same,
though all else rise and decay….

[Page 253] “There is one, Rudra alone,…
who rules world in his might.

He stands behind all beings, he made all worlds,
and protects them, and rolls dm up at end of time.

“The Lord lives in faces of all beings.

in their heads, in their necks.

He lives in inmost heart of all,
the all-pervading, all-present Siva.” 22
This brings us very near to religious atmosphere of Bhagavad
Gītā, most exalted and beautiful of India’s religious poems, which
teaches fully-fledged theism and is part of more recent Hinduism,
rather than of old brahmanism, which slowly changed from religion of
sacrifice to one of devotion.



Ethics of Upanisads
In general Upanisads proclaim salvation by knowledge or realization,
rather than by faith or works. Their ethics r fundamentally pragmatic.

Good and evil r resolved in all-pervading Brahman, and r relative
terms only. From point of view of seeker after truth, that is good
which leads him to realization of Brahman, and evil reverse. Thus
anything which discourages meditative life is ultimately bad, and among
the most serious of these obstacles r selfish desires. In more than one
context it is said that universe came into existence through primeval
desire of World Soul; to attain bliss hermit must, so to speak, restore
the state of things before creation. normal values of world,
sacrifice, benevolence, and even asceticism, r only good in so far as they
lead soul upwards.

“There r three branches of Law. Sacrifice, study and charity r the
first, austerity is second, and to dwell in celibacy in house of one’s
teacher… is third. By all these one only reaches worlds of the
blessed, but man who is fixed in Brahman finds immortality.” 23
“The wise men of old did not want children. ‘What should we do with
children,’ they said, ‘when we hv Brahman and world besides?’ And
they conquered their desire for sons and wealth and heavenly worlds,
and wandered about as beggars…. He who knows [the mystery of brāhman]
becomes calm, restrained, satisfied, patient and confident, and he sees
himself in [Great] Self, sees all things as Self…. Evil does not
overcome him, but he overcomes evil. … Free from evil, free from decay,
free from hatred, free from thirst, he becomes [true] brahman.” 24
Occasionally it is suggested, especially in later Upanisads, that all
desires whatever r incompatible with saving knowledge.

[Page 254] “When all desires which cling to heart
fall away
then mortal becomes immortal,
and in this life finds Brahman.

“When all earthly ties of heart
are sundered,
then mortal becomes immortal.

This is end of all instruction.” 25
A life of ascetism was not absolutely necessary to salvation-even kings
are said to hv realized Brahman while still ruling; but saving
knowledge was at best very hard to obtain, and doubly difficult for one
whose mind was full of material cares and desires. All pleasure was
therefore suspect.

“The good is one thing and pleasant another.

Both, with their different ends, control man.

But it is well with him who chooses good,
while he who chooses pleasant misses his mark.”26
Though often rather negative, ethical attitude of Upanisads is
neither unmoral, nor antinomian. He who has not ceased from evil conduct
will never obtain Brahman. Here and there r passages of high ethical
value among reiterated mystical similes and parables of texts. Thus
honesty is highly extolled.

“Satyakama son of Jabālā said to his mother: ‘Mother, I want to be a
student. What is my family?’
“‘I don’t know your family, my dear,’ she said. ‘I had you in my
youth, when I travelled about lot as servant-and I just don’t know!

My name is Jabālā, and yours is Satyakāma, so say you r Satyakama
Jābālā.’6
“He went to Gautama Hāridrumata, and said: ‘I want to be your
student, sir. May I come?’
“‘What is your family, my friend?’ he asked.

“‘I don’t know my family, sir,’ he answered. ‘I asked my mother,
and she said that she had me in her youth, when she used to travel
about lot as servant…. She said that as she was Jabālā and I was
Satyakāma I was to give my name as Satyakāma Jābālā.’
“‘Nobody but true brahman would be so honest!’ he said…. ‘Go
and fetch me fuel, my friend, and I will initiate you, for you hv not
swerved from truth.’”27

A further fine ethical passage occurs in form of legend in the
Bṛ hadāraṇ yaka Upaniṣ ad. We quote this passage partly because an
allusion to it must hv puzzled many readers of T. S. Eliot. 28
[Page 255] “The threefold descendants of Prajapati, gods, men and
demons, were once students at feet of their father. When they had
finished their training gods said: ‘Sir, tell us something [good for our
souls]’. He uttered syllable DA, and then asked dm whether they had
understood.

“‘We understood’, they answered. ‘You told us DAmyata (be
selfcontrolled).’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you understood indeed!’
“Then men asked him, and he uttered same syllable DA, and then
asked dm whether they had understood. ‘We understood,’ they answered.

‘You told us DAtta (give),’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you understood indeed!’
“Then demons asked him, … and he uttered same syllable DA,
and then asked dm whether they had understood. ‘We understood,’ they
answered. ‘You told us DAyadhvam (be merciful).’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you
understood indeed!’
“And blessed voice of thunder ever repeats DA DA DA7—be
self-controlled, give, be merciful. So these three should ever be taught—
self-control, charity and mercy.”29
Perhaps highest ethical flight of Upanisads occurs in the
instructions said to hv been given by Yājñavalkya to his favourite wife
before taking up life of an ascetic. Remembering double meaning of
the word ātman, “self” or “soul”, passage may be read in two ways, but
the context shows that Higher Self is intended. This Higher Self, the
World Soul, mystic recognizes in all things, and loves dm for their
participation with himself in unity of spirit. passage is too long
to quote in full, but we paraphrase its most important parts.

“Yājñavalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayani. Maitreyi
knew something of World Soul, but Kātyāyanī only knew what
every woman knows. When he wished to enter on another phase of life
Yājñavalkya said: ‘Maitreyī, I am leaving home. Let me make a
settlement on you and Kātyāyanī.’
“Maitreyī asked: ‘My lord, if I owned whole earth and all its
wealth, should I be immortal?’
“‘No,’ Yajnavalkya replied, ‘your life would be life of the
wealthy, and there is no prospect of immortality in wealth.’
“Maitreyi said: ‘Of what use to me r things which will not give
me immortality? Give me rather your knowledge, my lord.’
“‘Lady,’ he replied, ‘you r truly dear to me, and now you r even
dearer. So if you like I will teach you. Listen carefully!

“‘A husband is not dear for love of husband-a husband is dear
for love of Self. Similarly wife, sons, wealth, cattle, priests and
warriors, worlds, gods, Vedas, everything—none of dm r dear
in their own right, but all r dear for love of Self.

“‘Truly you cn see and hear and perceive and know Self,
Maitreyi. [Page 256] And when you hv seen, heard, perceived and
known Self you will know all things.

“‘Where there seems to be duality of self and not-self one sees,
smells, tastes, perceives, hears, touches and knows something other.

But when all is Self there is no consciousness of anything other
than Self. … Thus Maitreyi I hv instructed you-this is immortality!’
“When he had said this Yājñavalkya went away.” 30


(II) BUDDHISM
The Buddha
While doctrines of Upanisads found place in brahmanic
system, there were other teachings which could not be harmonized with
orthodoxy, but were fostered and developed by heterodox sects. Chief
among teachers of such doctrines was man who at end of the
sixth and beginning of fifth century B.C. established community of
yellow-robed followers, and was known by dm as Buddha, the
Enlightened or Awakened. Even if judged only by his posthumous effects
on world at large he was certainly greatest man to hv been born in
India.

The traditional story of Buddha, like those of most saints and heroes
of ancient days, has suffered much at hands of higher criticism. The
story of his birth and early life appears only in later books of the
Buddhist Scriptures, and even some of references to him in those parts
of canon which purport to give his teachings verbatim r by no means
reliable. Even “Sermon of Turning of Wheel of Law”, which
is said. to be first sermon preached after Buddha’s enlightenment,
and which is basic teaching of all Buddhist sects, is of dubious
authenticity, and in form in which we hv it is not among earliest
parts of canon. Much doubt now exists as to real doctrines of the
historical Buddha, as distinct from those of Buddhism. One eminent
authority suggested that they differed but little from teachings of the
Upanisadic sages,31 while another held that he rejected doctrine of
transmigration, and taught merely almost self-evident truism that one
generation is affected by deeds of preceding one. 32 We here discuss,
however, not life of Buddha, but what his later followers believed
about his life, and not what he taught, but what Buddhism taught.

Certain facts about Buddha’s life r reasonably certain. He was the
son of chief of Śakyas, small tribe of Himalayan foothills. He
became an ascetic, and propounded new doctrine which gained the
support of numerous disciples. After many years [Page 257] of teaching in
the kingdoms of Kosala and Magadha and in tribal lands to north of
the Ganges, he died at age of eighty at some time between years 486
and 473 B.C., probably nearer former date than latter. story of his
life as told by his followers is far more vivid and colourful than this dry
outline, and it is infinitely more important, for it has influenced lives of
countless millions throughout whole of Asia east of Afghanistan.

One night Mahamaya, 8 chief queen of Suddhodhana, king of Sakyas,
dreamt that she was carried away to divine lake Anavatapta in the
Himalayas, where she was bathed by heavenly guardians of four
quarters of universe. great white elephant with lotus flower in his
trunk approached her, and entered her side (pl. XXIIIc). Next day dream
was interpreted for her by wise men-she had conceived wonderful son,
who would be either Universal Emperor (p. 83) or Universal Teacher.

The child was born in grove of sāl trees called Lumbini, near capital
of Sakyas, Kapilavastu, while his mother was on way to her parents’
home for her confinement. At birth he stood upright, took seven strides, and
spoke: “This is my last birth-henceforth there is no more birth for me.”
The boy was named Siddhartha, at great ceremony on fifth day
from his birth. His gotra name was Gautama (in Pali, Gotama) by which he
is commonly referred to in Buddhist literature. soothsayers prophesied
that he would become Universal Emperor, with exception of one, who
declared that four signs would convince him of misery of world, and
he would become Universal Teacher. To prevent this prophecy coming
true King Śuddhodhana resolved that he should never know sorrows of
the world. He was reared in delightful palaces, from whose parks every sign
of death, disease and misery was removed. He learned all arts that a
prince should learn, and excelled as student. He married his cousin
Yaśodharā, whom he won at great contest at which he performed feats of
strength and skill which put to shame all other contestants, including his
envious cousin Devadatta.

But for all his prosperity and success he was not inwardly happy, and for
all efforts of his father he did see four signs foretold, which were to
decide his career, for gods knew his destiny, and it was they who placed
the signs before him. One day, as he was driving round royal park with
his faithful charioteer Channa, he saw an aged man, in last stages of
infirmity and decrepitude-actually god, who had taken this disguise in
order that Siddhartha Gautama might become Buddha. Siddhārtha asked
Channa who this repulsive being was, and when he learned that all men
must grow old he was even more troubled in mind. This was first sign.

The second came little later, in same way, in form of very sick
man, covered with boils and shivering with fever. third was even more
terrible-a corpse, being carried to cremation [Page 258] ground,
followed by weeping mourners. But fourth sign brought hope and
consolation—a wandering religious beggar, clad in simple yellow robe,
peaceful and calm, with mien of inward joy. On seeing him Siddhartha
realized where his destiny lay, and set his heart on becoming wanderer.

Hearing of this King Suddhodhana doubled his precautions. Siddhartha
was made virtual prisoner, though still surrounded with pleasures and
luxuries of all kinds; his heart knew no peace, and he could never forget the
four signs. One morning news was brought to him that Yaśodharā had
given birth to son, but it gave him no pleasure. That night there were great
festivities, but when all were sleeping he roused Channa, who saddled his
favourite horse Kanthaka, and he rode off into night, surrounded by
rejoicing demigods, who cushioned fall of his horse’s hoofs, so that no
one should hear his departure (p. 453, and pl. XXXV c).

When far from city he stripped off his jewellery and fine garments,
and put on hermit’s robe, provided by an attendant demigod. With his
sword he cut off his flowing hair, and sent it back to his father with his
garments by hand of Channa. horse Kanthaka dropped dead from
grief, when he found that he was to be parted from his master, to be reborn
in one of heavens. Thus Siddhartha performed his “Great Going Forth”
( Mahābhiniṣ kramaṇ a), and became wandering ascetic, owning nothing
but robe he wore.

At first he begged his food as wanderer, but he soon gave up this life
for that of forest hermit. From sage named Ālāra Kālāma he learned the
technique of meditation, and lore of Brahman as taught in the
Upanisads; but he was not convinced that man could obtain liberation from
sorrow by self-discipline and knowledge, so he joined forces with five
ascetics who were practising most rigorous self-mortification in the
hope of wearing away their karma and obtaining final bliss.

His penances became so severe that five quickly recognized him as
their leader. For six years he tortured himself until he was nothing but a
walking skeleton. One day, worn out by penance and hunger, he fainted,
and his followers believed that he was dead. But after while he recovered
consciousness, and realized that his fasts and penances had been useless. He
again began to beg food, and his body regained its strength. five
disciples left him in disgust at his backsliding.

One day Siddhartha Gautama, now thirty-five years old, was seated
beneath large pīpal tree on outskirts of town of Gayā, in realm
of Bimbisara king of Magadha. Sujata, daughter of nearby farmer,
brought him large bowl of rice boiled in milk. After eating some of this he
bathed, and that evening, again sitting beneath pīpal tree, he made a
solemn vow that, though his bones wasted away and his blood dried up, he
would not leave his seat until riddle of suffering was solved.

So for forty-nine days he sat beneath tree. At first he was surrounded
by hosts of gods and spirits, awaiting great moment of enlightenment;
but they soon fled, for Mara, spirit of world and of sensual pleasure,
the Buddhist devil, approached. For days Gautama withstood [Page 259]
temptations of all kinds (pls. XXVIII, LXXV). Mara, disguised as a
messenger, brought news that wicked cousin Devadatta had revolted,
thrown Suddhodhana into prison, and seized Yasodhara, but Gautama was
not moved. Mara called his demon hosts, and attacked him with whirlwind,
tempest, flood and earthquake, but he sat firm, cross-legged beneath the
tree. Then tempter called on Gautama to produce evidence of his
goodness and benevolence; he touched ground with his hand, and the
Earth itself spoke with voice of thunder: “I am his witness”.

Mara then tried gentler means of shaking Gautama’s resolve. He called
his three beautiful daughters, Desire, Pleasure and Passion, who danced and
sang before him, and tried every means of seduction. Their wiles were quite
ineffectual. They offered him Universal Empire; but he was quite unmoved.

At last demon hosts gave up struggle and Gautama, left alone,
sank deeper and deeper into meditation. At dawning of fortyninth
day he knew truth. He had found secret of sorrow, and understood at
last why world is full of suffering and unhappiness of all kinds, and
what man must do to overcome them. He was fully enlightened—a Buddha.

For another seven weeks he remained under Tree of Wisdom ( bodhi),
meditating on great truths he had found.

For time he doubted whether he should proclaim his wisdom to the
world, as it was so recondite and difficult to express that few would
understand it; but god Brahma himself descended from heaven and
persuaded him to teach world. Leaving Tree of Wisdom, he
journeyed to Deer Park near Banāras (the modern Sārnāth), where his
five former disciples had settled to continue their penances.

To these five ascetics Buddha preached his first sermon, or, in
Buddhist phraseology, “set in motion Wheel of Law”. five were
so impressed with his new doctrine that they gave up their austerities and
once more became his disciples. few days later band of sixty young
ascetics became his followers, and he sent dm out in all directions to
preach Buddhist Dharma. Soon his name was well known throughout
the Ganges Plain, and greatest kings of time favoured him and his
followers. He gathered together disciplined body of monks (called
bhiksus, or in Pali bhikkhus, literally “beggars”), knit together by common
garb, yellow robes of order, and common discipline, acc to
tradition laid down in detail by Buddha himself. Many stories r told of
his long years of preaching. He returned to Kapilavastu, and converted his
father, wife and son, Rahula, as well as many other members of court,
including his cousin Devadatta, whose heart remained full of jealousy. At
the request of his foster-mother and aunt, Kṛṣā-Gautamī, he allowed with
much misgiving formation of community of nuns. Devadatta grew so
jealous of him that once he even tried to kill Buddha, by arranging for a
mad elephant to be let loose in his path; but beast, impressed by the
Buddha’s gentleness and fearlessness, calmly bowed at his feet (pl. XXXV
a). He averted war between Sakyas and neighbouring tribe of the
Koliyas, by walking between assembled armies and convincing dm of
[Page 260] uselessness and evil of bloodshed. He went alone to the
camp of notorious bandit, Aṅgulimāla, and converted him and his
followers from their evil ways.

Though acc to legend his life was attended by many wonders, the
earliest traditions record few miracles performed by Buddha himself.

Once, indeed, he is said to hv performed feats of levitation and other
miracles at Sravasti, as result of challenge from rival teachers, but he
sternly forbade monks to perform magical feats, and there is no record
of his healing sick by supernatural means. One touching story of the
Buddha is interesting in this connexion, since it contrasts strikingly with the
Gospel stories of miracles of Jesus. woman, stricken with grief at the
death of her only son, and hearing that Buddha was in vicinity,
brought child’s corpse to him in hope that he would restore it to life.

He asked her first to go to nearby town and bring handful of mustard
seed from family in which no one had died. She went from house to
house, but of course could find no such family, until at last she understood
the inevitability of death and sorrow, and became nun.

For eight months of year Buddha and his followers would travel
from place to place, preaching to all and sundry. For four months of the
rainy season, roughly corresponding to English summer, they would
stop in one of parks given to Buddhist order by wealthy lay
followers, living in huts of bamboo and reed-the first form of great
Buddhist monasteries of later times. For over forty years his reputation
grew and Saṅ gha (literally Society, Buddhist Order) increased in
numbers and influence. With exception of conspiracy of Devadatta
he suffered no persecution, though few of his followers were maltreated
by their religious opponents. His ministry was long, calm and peaceful
one, in this respect very different from that of Jesus.

The end came at age of eighty. He spent last rainy season of his
life near city of Vaiśālī, and after rains he and his followers
journeyed northwards to hill country which had been home of his
youth. On way he prepared his disciples for his death. He told dm that
his body was now like worn-out cart, creaking at every joint. He declared
that he had made no distinction between esoteric and exoteric teaching, but
had preached full doctrine to them.9 When he was gone they were to
look for no new leader-the Doctrine ( Dharma) which he had preached
would lead them. They must rely on themselves, be their own lamps, and
look for no refuge outside themselves.

At town of Pava he was entertained by lay disciple, Cunda the
smith, and ate meal of pork.10 Soon after this he was attacked by
dysentery, but he insisted on moving on to nearby town of Kusinagara
(Pali, Kusinara). Here, on outskirts of town, he lay down under sal


tree, [Page 261] and that night he died. His last words were: “All composite
things decay. Strive diligently!” This was his “Final Blowing-out”
( Parinirvāna). His sorrowing disciples cremated his body, and his ashes
were divided between representatives of various tribal peoples and King
Ajātaśatru of Magadha.

The Growth of Buddhism
According to tradition great gathering of monks met at Magadhan
capital of Rajagrha soon after Buddha’s death. At this council Upali,
one of chief disciples, recited Vinaya Piṭ aka, or rules of Order,
as he recalled having heard Buddha give them. Another disciple,
Ananda, who bears position in Buddhism similar to that of St. John in
Christianity, recited Sutta Piṭ aka, great collection of Buddha’s
sermons on matters of doctrine and ethics. Though there may hv been
some sort of council, story as it stands is certainly untrue, for it is
quite evident that scriptures of Buddhism grew by long process of
development and accretion, perhaps over several centuries.

A second general council is said to hv been held at Vaiśālī, one
hundred years after Buddha’s death. Here schism raised its head,
ostensibly over small points of monastic discipline, and Order broke
into two sections, that of orthodox Sthaviravādins (Pāli Theravādī) or
“Believers in Teaching of Elders”, and that of Mahāsaṅ ghikas or
“Members of Great Community”. tradition of second council is
as dubious as that of first, but it at least records that schism began very
early. minor points of discipline on which Order divided were soon
followed by doctrinal differences of much greater importance.

Numerous such differences appeared at third great council, held at
Pataliputra under patronage of Asoka, which resulted in expulsion of
many heretics and establishment of Sthaviravada school as
orthodox. At this council it is said that last section was added to Pali
scriptures, Kathāvatthu of Abhidhamma Piṭ aka, dealing with
psychology and metaphysics. In fact many of works of this part of the
canon r of later composition, and details of account of council
are suspect, but record shows that by this time widespread differences
had developed within Order.

Meanwhile great changes were taking place in constitution of
Buddhism. Some modern authorities believe that Buddha had no
intention of founding new religion, and never looked on his doctrine as
distinct from popular cults of time, but rather as transcending them
—a sort of super-doctrine, which would help his [Page 262] followers
further along road to salvation than brahmanism or Upanisadic gnosis.

This view is, in our opinion, very questionable. Though traditions of
Buddhism give little evidence of direct antagonism between Buddhists and
brāhmaṇs at this early period there was much antagonism between
Buddhists and other heterodox sects, such as Jainas and Ājīvikas. These
sects did not merely wrangle over doctrinal points, but carried on vigorous
propaganda among laymen for their support. We believe that even in the
days of Buddha himself Order consciously tried to build up a
following of layfolk, who would pay to Buddha their chief if not their
only homage. enormous gifts which so many wealthy people r said to
have made to Order r no doubt exaggerated, but tradition is more
probably partly true than wholly false, and at least some of wealthy
merchants who so liberally supported new teachings must hv looked
upon themselves as lay Buddhists. Whatever its position in Buddha’s
lifetime, 200 years later Buddhism was distinct religion. Aśoka classifies
all religions of his empire under five heads; (Buddhist) Saṅ gha, the
brāhmans, Ajivikas, Nirgranthas (or Jainas), and “other sects”. He
further declares that, while he gives his chief patronage to Buddhists, he
honours and respects dm all, and calls on his subjects to do likewise.36
By Aśoka’s time India was covered with vihāras, which were both
monasteries and temples. In becoming religion Buddhism borrowed and
adapted much from popular beliefs of time. Its simple ritual was in
no way based on sacrificial brahmanism, but on cult of caityas, or
sacred spots. These were often small groves of trees, or single sacred tree,
on outskirts of villages, and might also include tumuli, such as those in
which ashes of chiefs were buried. These caityas were abodes of
earth-spirits and genii who, to simpler folk, were more accessible and
less expensive to worship than great gods of Āryans. Jaina
scriptures show that unorthodox holy-men often made their homes in or
near caityas, no doubt in order to obtain alms from visitors; and the
Buddha is said to hv respected these local shrines, and to have
encouraged his lay followers to revere them.

Soon after Buddha’s death many communities of monks gave up the
practice of constant travel except in rainy season, and settled
permanently on outskirts of towns and villages, often near local
caityas. With time many of these little monasteries grew in size and
importance.

It was cult of caitya that Buddhism made its own. acc to
tradition stśpas or tumuli were built by recipients over [Page 263]
divided ashes of Buddha. Other stśpas, containing remains of locally
revered monks and ascetics of other denominations, rose up all over India in
succeeding centuries. Aśoka unearthed ashes of Buddha from their
original resting places and divided dm still further, rearing stśpas for them
all over India. sacred grove or tree of old popular cult became the
Bodhi Tree, pīpal, planted near stśpa to commemorate Buddha’s
enlightenment, and an object of great reverence. original Bodhi Tree of
Gayā, under which Buddha sat, became an object of pilgrimage, and
cuttings of it were carried as far as Ceylon. One feature of Buddhist Cult
which has now vanished is column, perhaps survival of phallic
emblem or megalith. Such columns existed in many ancient Buddhist
monasteries, but their place in cult is not clear. Temples proper, or
shrine-rooms, do not appear to hv been erected until beginning of the
Christian era, when Buddha began to be worshipped in form of an
image.

His simpler followers evidently raised Buddha almost to divinity
even in his lifetime, and after his death he was worshipped in his symbols—
the stśpa, recalling his Parinirvāna, and tree, recalling his
enlightenment. worship consisted of circumambulation in the
auspicious clockwise direction, and prostrations, with offerings of flowers.

Though more intelligent monks may hv recognized his true status, for
the ordinary believer he was greatest of gods. This is not surprising,
for to this day Indians feel and show utmost respect for those whom
they consider holy. It is rather matter of surprise that it was only 500 years
after Buddha’s death that theology developed which gave full
recognition to this state of affairs.

With support of Asoka Buddhism greatly expanded, spreading
throughout India and to Ceylon. There is some doubt as to how far the
doctrine had developed at this time, but at least rudimentary canon
existed, though perhaps not yet committed to writing. great Buddhist
holy places—the Lumbini Grove at Kapilavastu, where Buddha was
born, Tree of Wisdom at Gayā, where he gained enlightenment, the
Deer Park near Banaras, where he preached his first sermon, and grove
near Kusinagara, where he died-were visited by many pilgrims, including
Aśoka himself.

Though there is tradition of cruel persecution under Pusyamitra Śuṅga
the faith continued to grow. Of all religious remains of between 200 B.C.

and A.D. 200 so far discovered in India those of Buddhism far outnumber
those of brahmanism, Hinduism and Jainism, together. old stśpas were
enlarged and beautified with carved railings, terraces and gateways. All
classes of [Page 264] community, kings, princes, merchants and
craftsmen, made donations to Order, which r recorded in numerous
inscriptions. Though individual monk was bound by his vows to own no
property except bare necessities, and to touch no silver or gold, the
monasteries grew rich on alms of faithful. revenues of whole
villages were alienated to dm by pious kings, and even individual
monks began to take their vows of poverty lightly, for more than one
inscription records donations made to Order by ordained members of it.

Though there is little evidence of strong sectarian animus within Order,
sects already existed, and scriptures had been codified in more than one
recension. It is possible that much of Pali canon of Sthaviravadins,
in form in which we hv it, emanates from great monastery, the
remains of which, on hilltop near modern village of Sānchī, r among
the finest relics of early Buddhism.

Another very important sect, Sarvāstivādins, was strong in region
of Mathurā and in Kashmīr. It was in Kashmīr, acc to tradition,
preserved in China, that fourth great council was held, under the
patronage of Kaniṣka (1st-2nd century A.D., p. 60f), at which the
Sarvāstivādin doctrines were codified in summary, Mahāvibhāṣ ā. It
was chiefly among Sarvāstivādins, but also in old schism of the
Mahāsanghikas, that new ideas developed, which were to form basis of
the division of Buddhism into “Great” and “Lesser Vehicles”
( Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna). brāhmaṇs and their lay supporters had by
now largely turned from older gods, whom they worshipped with animal
sacrifices, towards others, who were worshipped with reverent devotion. In
N.-W. India rule of Greeks, Śakas and Kuṣāṇas in turn had thrown open
the gates to West, and ideas from Persia and beyond entered India in
greater strength than before. In these conditions teachers of early
Christian centuries gave to Buddhism wholly new outlook. They claimed
to hv found new and great vehicle which would carry many souls to
salvation, while Sthaviravadins and kindred sects had but small one.

The Great Vehicle became rapidly popular in many parts of India, for it
fitted mood of times and needs of many simple people better
than did Lesser Vehicle, which soon began to lose ground. In Ceylon,
however, Lesser Vehicle resisted all attacks of new sects and
thence it was taken to Burma, Siam and other parts of South-East Asia,
where it became national religion.

The Great Vehicle, on other hand, itself soon divided by various
schisms, was carried by succession of Indian monks to China and thence
to Japan. By time of Guptas it predominated, and [Page 265] Hsiian
Tsang, in 7th century, found Lesser Vehicle almost extinct in most of
India, and only flourishing in few parts of West; evidently it had
ceased to make strong emotional appeal in India of early Hinduism.

Buddhism as whole was already declining. In many places great
monasteries were in ruins, and places of pilgrimage almost deserted. But the
faith was still important, and had thousands of monks and many prosperous
monasteries. Chief of these was Nalanda (p. 164f), which, under the
patronage of kings of Pala line, remained centre of Buddhist piety and
learning until Muslim invasion. From Nalanda missionary monk
Padmasambhava went forth to convert Tibet to Buddhism in 8th
century, while pilgrims from as far afield as China and South-East Asia
visited it to learn pure doctrine.

PLATE LVIII
At this time general standards of culture in North India were
declining. From end of Gupta period onwards Indian religion
became more and more permeated with primitive ideas of sympathetic
magic and sexual mysticism, and Buddhism was much affected by these
developments. third vehicle, “the Vehicle of Thunderbolt”
( Vajrayānaz), appeared in Eastern India in 8th century, and grew rapidly
in Bengal and Bihār. It was this form of Buddhism, modified by primitive
local cults and practices, which was finally established in Tibet, in 11th
century, as result of missions sent from great Vajrayāna monastery of
Vikramaśīla, in Bihār.

Anti-Buddhist persecution was not wholly unknown at this time. In the
6th century HŚṇa king Mihirakula destroyed monasteries and killed
monks. fanatical Śaivite king of Bengal, Śaśānika, in course of an
attack on Kānyakubjaat very beginning of 7th century, almost
destroyed Tree of Wisdom at Gaya. There r other less reliable


accounts of persecution, but it is certain that this was not main cause of
the disappearance of Buddhism from India. more important factor was
the revived and reformed Hinduism, which began to spread northwards
from Tamil country from 9th century onwards, when great
theologian Śankara travelled length and breadth of India disputing with
the Buddhists. Behind him he left an organized body of Hindu monks, to
carry on his work. new form of devotional Hinduism made very
vigorous appeal to ordinary man, and persistent tendency of
Hinduism to assimilate, rather than to attack, was always at work.

As early as Gupta period Buddhist monks often took part in Hindu
processions. Buddhist family, which gave its chief support to local
monastery, would at all times rely on services of brāhmaṇs at births,
marriages and deaths. If for time Buddhism became to all intents and
purposes separate religion, denying [Page 266] Vedas, ordinary
layman might not see it in that light. For him Buddhism was one of many
cults and faiths, by no means mutually exclusive, all of which led to
salvation, and all of which were respectable and worthy of honour. Thus, in
medieval North India, Buddha came to be looked on as ninth of the
ten incarnations of great god Visnu, (p. 306f), and Buddhism gradually
lost its individuality, becoming special and rather unorthodox Hindu sect,
which, like many others, did not survive. Hinduism, relying for its strength
mainly on independent brāhmaṇs and ascetics, and on domestic
ceremonies, suffered from Muslim invasion, but was not seriously
weakened by it. Buddhism, by now mainly concentrated in large
monasteries, and already rapidly declining in influence, could not stand up
to change. In first rush of Muslim advance down Ganges
Nalanda and other great monasteries of Bihar were sacked, libraries were
burnt, and monks were put to sword. survivors fled to the
mountains of Nepal and Tibet, and Buddhism in India was dead.

The Lesser Vehicle
According to Sinhalese tradition Pali canon of Sthaviravadin
school was committed to writing in Ceylon, in reign of King
Vaṭṭagāmaṇi (89–77 B.C.), after it had been finally established at great
council of Sinhalese monks. If we r to believe tradition it had already
been sifted and codified at three councils of Rajagrha, Vaiśālī and
Pāṭaliputra, and had been passed down by word of mouth for some four
centuries, by teachers who had not strict mnemonic system of Vedic
schools. As late as 5th century A.D. written scriptures were rare, and the
pilgrim Fa-hsien was hard put to it to find copy of Vinaya Piṭ aka.

Probably even codification of canon in Ceylon did not end the
process of accretion and interpolation.

At same time as canon old commentaries in Sinhalese Prakrit
were also committed to writing. These were translated into Pāli, and no
doubt considerably altered and expanded, by great doctor Buddhaghosa,
who worked in Ceylon in 5th century. original commentaries have
completely vanished, and some hv doubted whether they ever existed, but
it is at least certain that Buddhaghosa had access to many very early
traditions not recorded elsewhere.

As it stands today Pāli canon of Sthaviravādins, including the
scriptures, commentaries and semi-canonical texts, would fill fair-sized
bookcase. It consists of three sections called “baskets” ( piṭ aka), from the
fact that long strips of prepared palm-leaf on [Page 267] which texts
were written were originally stored in baskets. These three r known as the
Vinaya (“Conduct”), Sutta11 (“Sermon”) and Abhidhamma (”Metaphysics“)
Piṭakas.

The Vinaya Piṭ aka contains pronouncements attributed to Buddha,
laying down numerous rules for conduct of Order. With each rule
the circumstances which led Buddha to propound it r given, and thus
the Vinaya contains much early traditional matter.

The largest and most important of “Three Baskets “is Sutta
Piṭaka, which is divided into five “Groups” ( Nikāya):
(1) Dīgha (Long) Nikāya, collection of long sermons ascribed to
the Buddha, with accounts of circumstances in which he preached
them.

(2) Majjhima (Medium) Nikāya, shorter sermons.

(3) Saṃ yutta (Connected) Nikāya, collections of brief
pronouncements on kindred topics.

(4) Anguttara (Graduated) Nikāya, collection of over 2,000 brief
statements, arranged rather artificially in eleven sections, acc to
the number of topics treated in each statement. Thus Section Two
contains discussion on two things which man should avoid;
Section Three, one on trinity of thought, word and deed, and so on.

(5) Khuddaka (Minor) Nikāya, miscellaneous works in prose and
verse, some very ancient, but certainly added later to canon than
the four other Nikāyas. Among contents of Khuddaka r the
Dhammapada (“Verses on Virtue”), Theragāthā and the
Therīgāthā (“Hymns of Elder Monks and Nuns), which contain
some of India’s greatest religious poetry, and Jātaka, collection
of over 500 poems, briefly outlining folktales and other stories, which
were originally intended to be told in words of narrator. tales
are told in full in prose commentary attributed to Buddhaghosa,
which is invariably published with verses. Most of tales are
secular, and they do not all convey very exalted message, but they
have all been given an odour of sanctity by being ascribed to the
Buddha, who is said to hv told dm as recollections of his previous
births as Bodhisattva, being destined to become Buddha. These
racy and vivid stories r great as literature, and will be considered
elsewhere in that aspect (p. 455ff). They r an invaluable source of
social history.

The third Pitaka, Abhidhamma, consists of number of drily pedantic
works on Buddhist psychology and metaphysics, and is of little interest
except to specialist. It is certainly later than other two Piṭakas.

As well as canon and its many commentaries there r several semi-
canonical works. Chief of these is “Questions of Menander” [Page 268]
( Milinda-pañha), an account of discussions of GrecoBactrian king
and monk Nāgasena, which is written with such literary and dialectical
skill that it has been suggested, without much evidence, that author
knew something of Plato. Of different character r verse chronicles
which tell history of Buddhism in Ceylon, and give valuable
information on political and social history also. Of these, earliest,
Dīpavaṃ sa (the “Island Chronicle”) dates from 4th century A.D., and
has no literary merit, but Mahāvaṃ sa (“Great Chronicle”) of the
following century, contains passages of beauty and vigour (p. 457f). It was
continued as Cūlavaṃ sa (“Lesser Chronicle”) by succession of
monks down to fall of kingdom of Kandy to British at the
beginning of 19th century.

The basic propositions of this great body of literature r not
metaphysical, but psychological. Sorrow, suffering, dissatisfaction, and all
the manifold unpleasantnesses which r referred to by word dukkha,
are inherent in life as it is ordinarily lived; they cn only be eliminated by
giving up “thirst” ( taṇ hā), often translated “craving”, which includes
personal ambition, desire, longing, and selfishness of all kinds. According
to orthodox teaching cause of this “thirst” is innate but mistaken
conviction of individualitythat there is in each living being permanent
core, an ego or soul. While this doctrine was subscribed to at very early
period by all Buddhist sects some modern authorities deny that it was
taught by Buddha, and claim that he merely taught abandonment of
selfhood and individualism on lower plane of everyday life, but
maintained existence of an eternal soul. This proposition we find hard to
believe, despite certain apparent inconsistencies in Pali scriptures. If we
can place any reliance at all upon legend of Buddha’s life, the
knowledge gained under Tree of Wisdom was startlingly original, and
not mere rehash of lore of Upanisadic sages, with comparatively
slight shifting of emphasis.

Whatever Buddha’s original doctrine, there cn be no question about
the fundamental teaching of Buddhism, kernel of which is contained in
the “Sermon of Turning of Wheel of Law”
( Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta), which Buddha is said to have
preached to his first disciples at BanĀras This contains “Four Noble
Truths”, and “Noble Eightfold Path”, which r accepted as basic
categories by all Buddhist sects. We give it in somewhat abridged form.

“Thus I hv heard. Once Master was at Banaras, at deer
park called Isipatana. There Master addressed five monks:
[Page 269] “‘There r two ends not to be served by wanderer.

What r those two? pursuit of desires and of pleasure which
springs from desires, which is base, common, leading to rebirth,
ignoble and unprofitable; and pursuit of pain and hardship, which
is grievous, ignoble and unprofitable. Middle Way of the
Tathagata12 avoids both these ends; it is enlightened, it brings clear
vision, it makes for wisdom, and leads to peace, insight, full wisdom
and Nirvana. What is this Middle Way?… It is Noble Eightfold
Path-Right Views, Right Resolve, Right Speech, Right Conduct, Right
Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Recollection and Right Meditation.

This is Middle Way….

“‘And this is Noble Truth of Sorrow. Birth is sorrow, age is
sorrow, disease is sorrow, death is sorrow, contact with unpleasant
is sorrow, separation from pleasant is sorrow, every wish
unfulfilled is sorrow-in short all five components of individuality
are sorrow.

“‘And this is Noble Truth of Arising of Sorrow. [It arises
from] thirst, which leads to rebirth, which brings delight and passion,
and seeks pleasure now here, now there-the thirst for sensual pleasure,
the thirst for continued life, thirst for power. “‘And this is the
Noble Truth of Stopping of Sorrow. It is complete stopping of
that thirst, so that no passion remains, leaving it, being emancipated
from it, being released from it, giving no place to it.

“‘And this is Noble Truth of Way which Leads to the
Stopping of Sorrow. It is Noble Eightfold Path-Right Views, Right
Resolve, Right Speech, Right Conduct, Right Livelihood, Right Effort,
Right Recollection and Right Meditation.”’37
Though there r many difficulties in interpreting finer points of this
short sermon its main message is quite clear-sorrow (remembering that the
Pali word dukkha covers far wider range of feeling than English word
with which we translate it) is inherent in ordinary life; it is due to craving
for individual satisfaction; it cn only be stopped by stopping that craving;
and this cn only be done by taking middle course between self-
indulgence and extreme asceticism and leading moral and well-ordered
life.

This very simple doctrine was developed in various rather pedantic
forms, most important of which was “Chain of Dependent Origination”
( Paṭ icca-samuppāda), series of twelve terms, repeated in more than one
passage of Pali scriptures, commented on again and again by ancient
and modern scholars, and probably not fully understood by anybody. Out of
Ignorance arises Imagination, thence Self-consciousness, thence Name and
Form (i.e. corporeal existence), thence Six Senses,13 thence Contact,
thence Feeling [Page 270] (or Emotion), thence Craving, thence
Attachment, thence Becoming, thence Rebirth, and thence all manifold
ills that flesh is heir to.

The mechanics of this doctrine r indeed obscure, but it shows that the
craving which, acc to Buddha’s first sermon, is at bottom of
human misery is ultimately due to ignorance—a sort of cosmic ignorance
which leads to delusion of selfhood. ignorance primarily concerns
the fundamental nature of universe, which has three salient
characteristics—it is full of sorrow ( dukkha), it is transient ( anicca), and it
is soulless ( anatta).

The universe is sorrowful. Buddhists would not claim that there was no
happiness in world, but that in some form or other sorrow was
inevitable in every aspect of life. “As ocean has only one flavour, the
flavour of salt,” Buddha is purported to hv said, “so has my doctrine
only one flavour—the flavour of emancipation [from sorrow].” 38 In
ordinary existence sorrow cannot be long escaped.

The universe is transient. There is no abiding entity anywhere. In this
Buddhism has much in common with teaching of Heraclitus. Every
being or object, however stable and homogeneous it may appear, is in
reality transient and composite. Man, who thinks himself to be eternal and
individualized, is actually compound of five psychosomatic elements—
Body, Feelings, Perceptions, States of Mind, and Awareness. These five
vary from minute to minute and there is no permanent substratum to them.

The old man is evidently not same person as baby in arms of seventy
years ago, and similarly he is not same as man of moment ago. At
every instant old man vanishes, and new man, caused by first,
comes into being. Buddhism knows no being, but only becoming.

Everything is resolved into momentary configurations of events.14 The
universe is in continuous flux, and all idea of permanence is part of the
basic ignorance out of which sorrow springs.

Thus there is no immortal soul. universe is soulless. In
transmigration nothing passes over from one life to another—only new
life arises as part of chain of events which included old. Even the
gods r soulless and World Soul of Upanisads is an illusion. The
Buddhism of Lesser Vehicle is therefore religion without souls and
without god. No Buddhist teacher was rash enough to deny existence of
the gods outright, but they r thought of as beings in no way supernatural
or different from man except in their greater happiness and power. In his
search for salvation true Buddhist by-passes them, for they cn neither
[Page 271] help nor hinder him greatly, and they will in any case do what
they cn to help him if he keeps to Middle Way.

On these premisses machinery of transmigration—a doctrine which
was taken over by Buddhism from general beliefs of time—is hard
to explain. If nothing passes from life to life newborn being cannot be
thought of as in any way connected with being which has died, and
whose actions hv conditioned his present state. Yet new being suffers
as result of actions of old one. This objection was often raised by
the opponents of Buddhism, and was countered by analogy of flame
of lamp, which might kindle flame in another lamp and then be
extinguished. If this simile was unconvincing, it was pointed out that the
old man, though not same person as young one, suffered illness as a
result of excesses of his youth, and so one being might suffer as result
of evil done by an earlier being who was part of chain of cause and
effect leading up to his present existence. Terms like “individual”, “person”,
and so on were merely convenient labels for series of separate momentary
events which continued indefinitely, just as “chariot” was convenient label
for collection of pieces of wood and metal put together in certain
manner.

The only stable entity in Sthaviravada Buddhism was Nirvāṇ (in Pali,
Nibbāna), state of bliss reached by Buddhas and Arhants, or
perfected beings. Nirvana is difficult to understand for humbler being
who has not experienced it, and some early Western scholars believed that it
implied complete annihilation. statement attributed to Buddha: “I
have not said that Arhant exists after death, and I hv not said that he
does not exist… because … this is not edifying, neither does it tend to
supreme wisdom” 39 would suggest that Nirvana was believed to be state
neither of being nor annihilation. Aristotelian Law of Excluded
Middle was never strictly applied in Indian thought, and third state,
transcending both being and not-being, would not be considered an
impossibility. If whole world was in state of flux and Nirvana was a
state of rest this too did not present an insuperable paradox, for Nirvana was
outside universe; it underlay it, but was not part of it.

Such concept is not very different from that of World Soul of the
Upanisads, and, far from being looked on as state of annihilation, Nirvana
was described in brilliantly colourful language—“a glorious city, stainless
and undefiled, pure and white, unaging, deathless, secure and calm and
happy”.40 Nirvana has no definite location, but it may be realized anywhere
and at any time, while still in [Page 272] flesh. man who finds it
never again loses it, and when he dies he passes to this state forever, in his
parinirvāṇ a, his “Final Blowing Out”.

The doctrines which we hv described r those of Sthaviravadin
sect of Lesser Vehicle, which is only surviving sect of that branch of
Buddhism, and is today dominant in Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Cambodia and
Laos. Other sects of Lesser Vehicle hv now quite disappeared, though
they survived longer in India itself than Sthaviravādins. Chief among
these was sect of Sarvāstivādins (They who say “All is”), who had a
canon in Sanskrit, and who differed from Sthaviravadins in their view
that constituents of phenomena ( dharmas) were not wholly momentary,
but existed forever in latent form. Another important sect was that of the
Sautrāntikas, who maintained that our knowledge of outside world was
only feasible inference, and who were well on way to idealism of
some schools of Great Vehicle. fourth sect, Sammitāyas, even
went so far as to reject doctrine of soullessness and to postulate sort of
soul in pudgala or person, which passed from life to life. These early
sects of Buddhism probably gave much encouragement to evolution of
Indian philosophy, as distinct from mystical speculation.

Though Buddha is said to hv discouraged speculation on origin
and end of world, Buddhists of Lesser Vehicle devised a
cosmological scheme, based largely on prevalent Indian ideas, which
accounted for existence of world without intervention of a
creator.

As in all Indian cosmologies universe is cyclic. Over an enormous
period of time ( mahakalpa) it goes through process of evolution and


decline, only to evolve once more. cycle is divided into four great
periods ( asankhyeya). In first man declines, and at last everything is
destroyed except highest heaven; good go to this heaven, and the
sinners to hells of other universes, which may at that time be passing
through different stages. second period is one of quiescence. In the
third evolution again begins. good karma of beings in highest
heaven begins to fail, and “World of Form”, lower heaven, evolves. A
great being dies in highest heaven and is reborn in World of Form as
the god Brahmā. As he is only living thing therein he is lonely. But
other beings follow him from highest heaven to lower. As Brahma
was first to be born in World of Form, and their birth agrees with his
wishes, he imagines that he is creator of other gods, and of all the
world, which actually comes into existence through cosmic law. Meanwhile
the earth develops, [Page 273] as well as other earths. first men are
fairy-like beings, but gradually they degenerate and become earthbound (p.

82). fourth period is one of continuation, marked only by regular
pattern of comparative advance and decline, forming series of lesser
cycles within greater one. This process is repeated for all eternity, but
one great cycle is not exactly like next. There r “Buddha cycles” and
“empty cycles”, and we r fortunate that we live in Buddha cycle, in
which four Buddhas (Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa, and
Śākyamuni15) hv taught, and fifth (Maitreya) is yet to come.

The Evolution of Great Vehicle
It is never claimed in Pali scriptures that Buddha was in any way
supernatural. His supreme insight was gained by his own efforts, after many
ages of striving in many different births. But his birth, enlightenment and
death were cosmic events of highest importance, and his greatness was
such that even mighty gods Brahma and Śakra (an epithet of Indra
commonly used by Buddhists) did him reverence, not to speak of the
myriads of lesser deities inhabiting earth and heaven. He is reported to have
said that whoever had faith in him and love for him was assured of rebirth
in heaven,41 prospect which, as we know from Asoka’s inscriptions, was
much more intelligible and desirable to ordinary man than that of the
rarefied and indescribable Nirvāṇa.

When Buddha died, acc to orthodox theory, chain of his
existence was broken. He finally entered Nirvana which he had realized
at his enlightenment, and ceased to be an individual, or to affect the
universe in any way. Just before his death he had told his disciples to rely
on Doctrine for leadership. But soon after his death his followers
evolved “Three Jewels”, which form basic profession of faith of
Buddhism, and which every Buddhist, both monastic and lay, repeats to this
day: “I go for refuge to Buddha; I go for refuge to Doctrine
( Dharma); I go for refuge to Order ( Sangha).” Though theorists
might explain away first of Three Jewels, on obvious
interpretation “going for refuge to Buddha” implied that Master, as
distinct from his teaching, was in some way still present, and able to help
his followers.

The Buddha himself probably taught that he was last of long
succession of earlier Buddhas, who had lived before him. acc to
tradition these former Buddhas were revered even in historical Buddha’s
lifetime. By Mauryan times their cult was [Page 274] widespread, and was
patronized by Asoka. In end orthodox Sthaviravadin school counted
no less than twenty-five Buddhas, not to speak of large number of
pratyeka-buddhas, who had found truth for themselves without
guidance, but had not taught it to world.

The carvings of stśpas of Bhārhut and Sānchī, executed in 2nd
and 1st centuries B.C., depict crowds of adoring worshippers reverencing the
symbols of Buddha. little later sculptors began to carve images of the
Buddha himself, and within few generations all Buddhist sects took to
worshipping images. Buddhism kept up with times, and by Middle
Ages, even in shrines of Lesser Vehicle, Buddha was worshipped
just as Hindu god, with flowers, incense, waving lamps, and deep
devotion.

Among doctrines of Zoroastrianism, which has strongly influenced
other religions both East and West, is that of Saviour ( Šaošyant), who, at
the end of world, will lead forces of good and light against those of
evil and darkness. Under invading rulers of N.-W. India Zoroastrianism
and Buddhism came in contact, and it was probably through this that the
idea of future Buddha became part of orthodox belief. If there had been
Buddhas before Gautama there would be Buddhas after him. By time of


the “Questions of Menander”, around beginning of Christian era, the
cult of future Buddha, Maitreya, was widespread among all Buddhist
sects.

According to older conceptions Buddha, in long series of
transmigrations as Bodhisattva, wrought many deeds of kindness and
mercy before achieving his final birth as Sage of Sakyas; but since
Maitreya and other unnamed Buddhas after him r yet to come, there must
be Bodhisattvas existing at present in universe, who r working
continuously for welfare of all things living. Jātaka stories show
that Bodhisattvas cn be incarnated as men, or even as animals; but the
more advanced Bodhisattvas, who hv greatest power for good, must
be divine beings in heavens. Though neither omniscient nor almighty
these divine Bodhisattvas might be adored and prayed to without any
misgiving, for it was part of their mission to answer prayer, The
Bodhisattva doctrine, logical development from older Buddhism, thus
peopled heavens with mighty forces of goodness, and presented
Buddhism with new mythology. It was this which formed hallmark of
the Mahayana, Great Vehicle.

The Great Vehicle
According to older doctrine Bodhisattva works in wisdom and
love through many lives, so that he may become Buddha, and [Page 275]
ordinary believers r encouraged to follow his example, and win Nirvana
as quickly as possible. Yet since Bodhisattva is being of immeasurable
charity and compassion, surely while one suffering individual remains in
the toils of transmigration he will not leave him without help, and enter
Nirvana, where he cn be of no further service to world? So, quite
logically, Bodhisattva was thought of in schools of Great Vehicle
not as being who was soon to become Buddha, but as one who would
bide his time until even smallest insect had reached highest goal.

The old ideal of Arhant, “Worthy”, who achieved Nirvana and
would be reborn no more, began to be looked on as rather selfish. Instead of
striving to become Arhants men should aim at becoming Bodhisattvas, and
by spiritual merit which they gained assist all living things on way
to perfection.

The idea of transference of merit is special feature of teaching of
the Great Vehicle. acc to Lesser Vehicle man cn only help
another on Way by example and advice. Each being must be lamp
unto himself, and work out his own salvation. But belief in transference
of merit spread very widely, even sometimes among sects of Lesser
Vehicle. numerous Buddhist dedicatory inscriptions throughout India
often contain some such phrase as: “May it be for welfare of [the
donor’s] mother and father and of all living beings.”
Moreover, Bodhisattva was thought of not only as spirit of
compassion but also of suffering. In more than one source is given vow
or resolve of Bodhisattva, which is sometimes expressed in almost
Christian terms:
“I take upon myself… deeds of all beings, even of those in the
hells, in other worlds, in realms of punishment…. I take their
suffering upon me,… I bear it, I do not draw back from it, I do not
tremble at it,… I hv no fear of it,… I do not lose heart…. I must bear
the burden of all beings, for I hv vowed to save all things living, to
bring dm safe through forest of birth, age, disease, death and
rebirth. I think not of my own salvation, but strive to bestow on all
beings royalty of supreme wisdom. So I take upon myself all the
sorrows of all beings. I resolve to bear every torment in every
purgatory of universe. For it is better that I alone suffer than the
multitude of living beings. I give myself in exchange. I redeem the
universe from forest of purgatory, from womb of flesh, from
the realm of death. I agree to suffer as ransom for all beings, for the
sake of all beings. Truly I will not abandon them. For I hv resolved
to gain supreme wisdom for sake of all that lives, to save the
world.”42
[Page 276] idea of Suffering Saviour may hv existed in some
form in Middle East before Christianity, but ideas like this r not
attested in Buddhism until after beginning of Christian era. The
Suffering Bodhisattva so closely resembles Christian conception of the
God who gives his life as ransom for many that we cannot dismiss the
possibility that doctrine was borrowed by Buddhism from Christianity,
which was vigorous in Persia from 3rd century A.D. onwards.

The universe of Great Vehicle contains numerous Bodhisattvas, chief
of whom, from earthly point of view, is Avalokiteśvara (“The Lord who
Looks Down”), also called Padmapāṇ i (“The Lotus-Bearer”) (pl. LXXII).

His special attribute is compassion, and his helping hand reaches even to
Avīci, deepest and most unpleasant of Buddhist purgatories. Another
important Bodhisattva is Manjusri, whose special activity is to stimulate the
understanding, and who is depicted with naked sword in one hand, to
destroy error and falsehood, and book in other, describing ten
pāramitās, or great spiritual perfections, which r cardinal virtues
developed by Bodhisattvas.16 Vajrapāṇ i, sterner Bodhisattva, is foe of
sin and evil, and, like god Indra, bears thunderbolt in his hand. The
gentle Maitreya, future Buddha, is worshipped as Bodhisattva. Also
worthy of mention is Ksitigarbha, guardian of purgatories, who is
thought of not as fierce torturer, but rather as governor of model
prison, doing his best to make life tolerable for his charges, and helping
them to earn remission of sentence. Though Great Vehicle agrees in
theory with Lesser that world is full of sorrow, it is fundamentally
optimistic. world contains much good as well as evil, and there is help
for all who ask. Every living thing, from humblest worm upwards, is in
a sense Bodhisattva, for most schools of Great Vehicle maintain
implicitly or explicitly that ultimately all beings will attain Nirvāṇa and
become Buddha.

The Great Vehicle was not content with creating this pantheon of noble and
beneficient Bodhisattvas. Probably developing from old heresy of the
Mahāsaṅghika school (p. 261) idea arose that Gautama Buddha had not
been mere man, but earthly expression of mighty spiritual being.

This being has three bodies; Body of Essence ( Dharmakāya), Body of
Bliss ( Sambhogakāya), and Created Body ( Nirmāṇ akāya), and of these
only last was [Page 277] seen on earth. Body of Essence eternally
penetrates and permeates universe; it is ultimate Buddha, of which
the other two bodies r emanations, more or less unreal. Body of Bliss
exists in heavens, and will continue until final resolution of all
things into Body of Essence. Created Body was mere emanation
of Body of Bliss. This reminds us of Docetic heresy in Christianity,
and it has been suggested that Docetism and doctrine of Three
Bodies owe much to common gnostic source.

The Buddha’s Body of Bliss is presiding deity of most important
Mahayana heaven, Sukhavati, “Happy Land”, where blessed are
reborn in buds of lotuses, which rise from lovely lake before the
Buddha’s throne. This divine Buddha is usually called Amitābha
(Immeasurable Glory), or Amitāyus (Immeasurable Age). He too shares the
compassion of Bodhisattva, for, though he enjoys endless and infinite
bliss, he maintains an interest in his world, and especially in his heaven. At
his touch lotuses open, to give birth to blessed, who r nourished
and grow through food of his word. acc to some Chinese and
Japanese sects whoever calls on his name, however sinful he may have
been, is assured of rebirth in his heaven. Amitabha is, in fact, Father in
Heaven. He, historical Gautama Buddha, and Bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara r closely associated, and play bigger part in Mahayanist
thought than do other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, because they r chiefly
concerned with this region of universe and this period of cosmic time,
but there r many other heavenly Buddhas, presiding over other heavens
and other universes. All r emanations of primal Body of Essence,
which is no other than Brahman, World Soul or Absolute of the
Upanisads, in new guise. Body of Essence is sometimes referred to in
later Buddhist writings as Ādi Buddha, Primeval Buddha, and is also
described as Void ( Sunya), True ( Tattva), Wisdom ( Bodhi), or the
Womb of those who Attain Goal ( Tathagatagarbha). Moreover it is
Nirvāṇa. final state, which Sthaviravadin school found so difficult
to describe in words, was, for most sects of Great Vehicle, not really
different from mystical union with absolute Brahman of the
Upaniṣads. wheel turned full circle, and mystical monism which
early Buddhism so strongly opposed found its way into later Buddhism, but
with new terminology.

Most Buddhist sects of both Vehicles had their own versions of the
Pitakas, but, with exception of Pali Pitakas of Sthaviravadins,
these hv not survived in entirety, and in most of schools of Great
Vehicle their place was largely taken by later [Page 278] texts, mostly
composed in early centuries of Christian era. These r in Sanskrit,
which became official language of Great Vehicle in India, though in
other parts of Asia it tended to prefer local vernacular. Many of these
texts r ostensibly sermons of Buddha, but of much greater length than
those of Sutta Piṭaka; hence they were known as Vaipulya Sūtras
(“Expanded Sermons”).

Among earliest Mahayana texts is Lalitavistara, flowery
narrative of life of Buddha, containing much more of the
supernatural and marvellous than Pali account; this text was utilized
by Sir Edwin Arnold for Light of Asia, lengthy poem on Buddha’s
life which enjoyed much popularity at end of last century, and is still
readable, though its style has somewhat dated. Other important scriptures
are Saddharmapuṇṭ arīka (“The Lotus of Good Law”), long series
of dialogues of considerable literary merit; Vajracchedika (“Diamond
Cutter”), containing important metaphysical writing; Sukhāvatīvyūha,
describing glories of Amitabha and his paradise; Karaṇḍ avyūha,
glorifying Avalokiteśvara; and Aṣṭ asahasrikaprajñāpāramitā, a
workdescribing spiritual perfections of Bodhisattvas (p. 276, n).

Literature on this latter subject was considerable. As well as these sacred
texts Great Vehicle produced much religious poetry and great deal of
sectarian philosophical literature, some of very high merit.

The Sthaviravadin commentators were perhaps hampered by the
Buddha’s injunctions against unnecessary speculation, and, though they
could on occasion argue very logically, they produced few works of
systematic philosophy. Great Vehicle, on other hand, produced
many. It had two chief philosophical schools, Mādhyamika and the
Yogācāra.

The Mādhyamika (“Intermediate”) School, so called because it took a
line midway between uncompromising realism of Sarvastivadins
and idealism of Yogācāra, looked back to one of India’s greatest
philosophers, Nāgārjuna, who, acc to tradition, was contemporary
of Kaniska, and whose Mādhyamika Kārikā formed basic text of the
school. We hv seen that, in almost all Buddhist sects, universe was
believed to be flux of momentary but interdependent events ( dharma).

Nāgārjuna showed by very subtle arguments that on final analysis the
cosmic flux was unreal, as was consciousness which perceived it, and
which was itself part of flux. Therefore Samsara, immeasurably long
process of transmigration, did not really exist. If world of change was


unreal, its contrary, Nirvana, was also unreal. There was therefore [Page
279] no difference between Saṃsāra and Nirvana, which were one and the
same in their common nonentity. In fact if all things were equally unreal,
they were on ultimate analysis one and same. One Thing which
alone had real existence could hv no predicate it was therefore called by
Nāgārjuna “Emptiness”, or “the Void” ( Śūnyatā).

This philosophical nihilism did not lead Nāgārjuna and his followers to
scepticism or agnosticism. Though nothing but Void was wholly real,
the world and all that it contained, from Amitabha downwards, had a
qualified practical reality; and great Void underlying all universe
was, in fact, Body of Essence itself, Primeval Buddha, Nirvāṇa.

Final immeasurable bliss was here and now for all who would perceive it—
not something remote and cold, but very breath of life, nearer and more
real than one’s own heart. “The life of world is same as Nirvana…,”
said Madhyamikas, “and really there is no difference between dm at
all”. 43
The Yogācāra (“Way of Union”) or Vijndnavddin School completely
rejected realism of Lesser Vehicle, and maintained thorough-going
idealism, not even allowing qualified realism of Mādhyamikas. The
world was built by consciousness, and had no more reality than dream.

The only reality was “Suchness” ( Tathātā), also called Dharmadhātu (freely
translated “the Raw Material of Phenomena”), which was equivalent to
Nāgārjuna’s Void. Yogacara school, though perhaps less influential
than Madhyamika, produced many important philosophers and
logicians. Chief of these were Asaṅga, monk of Peshāwar of 4th or
5th century, whose Sūtrālaṅ kāra is earliest text of school,
Vasubandhu, younger brother of Asaṅga, and great logicians
Dignāga and Dharmakirti. Among most important writings of Yogācāra
is Lankāvatāra Sūtra, lengthy text of great subtlety.

The Vehicle of Thunderbolt
Quite early in history of Great Vehicle feminine divinities found
their way into pantheon. One such was Prañāpāramitā, Perfection of
Insight, personification of qualities of Bodhisattva. Later, the
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, who were thought of as male, were, like the
gods of Hinduism, endowed with wives, who were active aspect, the
“force” or “potency” ( sakti) of their husbands. god was thought of as
transcendent and aloof, while goddess was active in world; thus the
god might be best approached through goddess. productive activity
of divine was thought of in terms of sexual union, an [Page 280] idea as
old as Ṛ g Veda. With spread of these ideas sexual symbolism, and
even sexual intercourse as religious rite, were incorporated into the
teachings of some schools of both Hinduism and Buddhism.

With these ideas was combined new magical mysticism. Lesser
Vehicle taught that release was obtained by gradual loss of individuality
through self-discipline and meditation; Great Vehicle added that the
grace and help of heavenly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas assisted the
process. followers of new teachings taught that it could be best
attained by acquiring magical power, which they called vajra (thunderbolt,
or diamond). Hence new school of Buddhism was called Vajrayāna, the
Vehicle of Thunderbolt.

Even Sthaviravādins taught that monk who reached high stage
of detachment and mental training acquired supernatural powers. At all
times there were free-lance Buddhist monks, who did not live regularly in
monasteries under orthodox discipline, and who attempted feats of sorcery
and necromancy, such as Buddha is said to hv condemned. It was
perhaps among these free-lances that ideas of new Vehicle
developed, to be codified and given dignity under Pala kings of Bengal
and Bihār. Even in 7th century Hsüan Tsang found certain monasteries
permeated with magical practices.

The chief divinities of new sect were “Saviouresses” ( Tārās), the
spouses of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. There were also host of lesser
divinities, many called by names of demons, such as “outcaste women”
( matangis), demonesses ( pisacis), sorceresses ( yogin īs), and she-ghouls
(ṭ ākinīs). Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with their Tārās were
approximated to less amiable members of Hindu pantheon, and were
often depicted with many arms in ferocious poses.

As in days of brahmans, it was thought that these deities should
be compelled rather than persuaded. textbooks outlining means of
doing this ( sādhana) were called Tantras, and hence new cult is often
referred to as tantric. By pronouncing right formula ( mantra) in the
correct manner, or by drawing correct magical symbol ( yantra), one

might force gods to bestow magical power on worshipper and lead him to highest bliss. Among many formulæ of tantric Buddhism one is specially famous—the “Six Syllables” Ṣ aḍ akṣ arā), Ṑ m maṇ i padme hūm, still written and repeated thousands of times daily in Tibet. This phrase: “Ah! jewel is indeed in lotus!”, may be sexual in significance, mystically repeating divine coitus of heavenly Buddha and Prajñāpāramitā, and of Avalokiteśvara and his Tārā.

[Page 281] Tantric Buddhism did not neglect techniques of mental
training which were part of all chief religions of India, but their
direction was altered. Their primary purpose was to obtain supernormal
power. meditations of Vajrayana were often positively
psychopathic. practitioner of system might so hypnotize himself as
to imagine that he was reborn from womb of Tara, to kill his father the
Buddha and take his place. In sexual union with female devotee he and his
partner would become Buddha and Tara, or he himself might become Tara.

In sexual rites of tantric Buddhism all taboos were lifted. Even incest
was permitted, for what was sin to ignorant was virtue to initiate.

Drinking of alcohol, meat—eating, killing of animals, and sometimes even
of human beings—every imaginable sin—were practised at tantric
covens. These things were, however, done under strict control, and only by
initiates at sacred ceremonies. Like Bengali tantricist of later times the
Vajrayana initiate might in his ordinary life be normal man, whose
occasional religious debauchery served as catharsis to his evil
psychological propensities and was of real help to him in leading good
life as he understood it.

The Buddhist Order
Membership of Buddhist Order was not restricted by caste, but
slaves, soldiers, debtors, and other persons under obligation or in tutelage
might not enter it without permission of their superior. Novices might be
admitted from age of eight upwards, but they could only qualify for full
membership of Order after long course of study, at minimum age
of twenty. rites of admission were simple, involving putting on the
three yellow or orange robes of Order, ceremonially shaving head,
and pronouncing Three Jewels (p. 273) and “Ten Precepts”. The
latter form sort of Buddhist decalogue:
(1) “I accept precept to refrain from harming living beings.

[Page 282] These precepts were not lifelong vows, but earnest resolves.

They were repeated regularly, and if any monk felt that he could no longer
honestly maintain dm he might leave Order quite freely, though public
opinion tended to frown on backslider. vows were often taken for a
definite duration only, as is still done in Burma, where boys on leaving
school often spend some months in monastery in preparation for adult life.

In this Buddhist Order sharply contrasts with Christian monasticism.

Of ten vows first did not originally involve complete
vegetarianism, though it came to do so in many Buddhist communities. A
monk might eat meat if animal providing it was not specially killed for
his benefit. third vow, for monk, meant absolute celibacy. fifth
was generally taken to mean abstention from all intoxicants. By sixth, a
monk might eat no solid food after midday; this, in warm climate and for
a man not engaged in strenuous work, was no very great hardship,
especially as monk might take sweetened beverages at any time. In
colder climates, such as that of Tibet, monks often take an evening meal,
which is looked on as medicine. seventh rule was not taken to include
singing and music for liturgical or other religious purposes. tenth was
interpreted very liberally in many monasteries. Strictly monk might own
only eight “requisites”—three robes, waist-cloth, an alms-bowl, razor, a
needle, and cloth to strain his drinking-water in order to save lives of
any animalculæ it might contain. In fact he often owned much more than
this by convenient fiction, not unknown in some Christian religious
communities, that his property belonged to Order, from which he had it
on loan.

The monk had to beg his food from door to door every morning, taking it
back to his monastery for his midday meal. As monasteries became
wealthy, however, begging round was often reduced to mere formality,
or dropped altogether.

While Buddhist monk resembled his Christian counterpart in his
vows of chastity and poverty, he took no vow of obedience. Each novice or
junior monk had his preceptor, and was expected to treat him with great
respect, but monk was essentially free member of community of free
men. There was no central authority to regulate many monasteries and
enforce uniformity; each was law unto itself, guided only by precepts
of Master as it had received them, and as it interpreted them. The
constitution of monastery had elements of democracy about it. chief
monk, or abbot, was not appointed from above or nominated by his
predecessor, but held office by suffrage of all monks in monastic
parish. day-to-day business of monastery was managed by [Page
283] committee of elder monks, and important decisions, such as the
admission or expulsion of members, could only be made by committee
and not by chief. Important business was discussed at meetings of the
whole monastery in chapter (p. 97).

The monks assembled every fortnight on evenings of full and new
moons for upavasatha (in Pāli, uposatha), an act of general confession. The
long list of monastic rules ( Prātimokṣ a, in Pāli Pātimokkha) from the
Vinaya Piṭ aka was read, and each monk confessed any breaches which he
had committed during preceding fortnight. If his fault was serious his
case was referred to committee of elders, which might impose penance or
expel him from Order. ceremony concluded with preaching of
sermons, to which pious layfolk of vicinity listened.

The daily life of monk was chiefly spent in study and religious
exercises, but he was expected to take his share in work of the
monastery, cleaning his cell, and sweeping courtyard and monastic


buildings, while elder monks devoted much of their time to teaching the
novices. Among most important of monk’s spiritual exercises were
the Four Sublime Moods ( Brahmavihāra), in which, sitting quietly cross-
legged, he endeavoured to fill his mind with four cardinal virtues of
Buddhism—love, pity, joy, and serenity-and to consider all living beings in
the light of these virtues. fifth mood was that of impurity, in which he
considered all vileness and horror of world and of life of the
flesh. For those more advanced in sanctity there were more advanced
meditations, which brought monk very near to realization of
Nirvāna.

One aspect of monk’s mental discipline which deserves mention is seventh element of “Noble Eightfold Path” (p. 269)—“Right Recollection”. He was taught to train himself to be continually aware of what he was doing, observing himself, as it were, all time. Every act must be fully conscious, and distraction, carelessness, and lack of consideration were serious faults. When he ate, monk should be aware of nature of act, its purpose, and transience of body which he fed, and similarly with every act throughout day. No doubt few but most advanced monks were able to keep up this state of “Right Recollection” continuously.
At one time India possessed numerous Buddhist nunneries, though nowmonastic life in Buddhism is confined to men, except in Tibet. nunswore yellow robes and shaved their heads like monks, and theirdiscipline was very similar. Though strict rules were laid down forpreserving respectability of two branches of Order, which oftendwelt in adjoining establishments, accusations of [Page 284] immoralitywere sometimes levelled against dm by their religious opponents, andthese accusations may hv had some foundation. sexual activity oftantric Buddhism, of course, did notconstituteabreach of vows, whenperformed in accordance with rites of sect.Buddhist Ethics and MoralityBuddhism inculcates high system of ethics. Noble Eightfold Path,whereby man attains Nirvana, is not merely matter of belief orknowledge, but also of conduct, and Four Cardinal Virtues of Buddhism(p. 283) r more positive in character than nonviolenceandabstinenceof Upaniṣads.The chief of these virtues, love (Pāli, mettā, Sanskrit, maitrī), issomewhat less tinged with emotion than comparable virtue inChristianity. term is derived from word mitra, “a friend”, and mightbe translated “friendliness”, “good will” or “benevolence”. Nevertheless theBuddhist scriptures contain passages which describe mettā with passionwhich recalls famous words of St. Paul on virtue of charity.

“May every living being, weak or strong, large or small, seen or unseen,
near or far, born or yet unborn—may every living thing be full of joy.

“May none deceive another, or think ill of him in any way whatever, or in anger or ill-will desire evil for another.

“Just as mother, as long as she lives, cares for her only child, so should man feel all-embracing love to all living beings.

“He should feel boundless love for all world, above below and across, unrestrained, without enmity. Standing, walking, sitting or lying down,… he should be firm in mindfulness of love. For this is what men call Sublime Mood.” 44
In this connexion following extract is interesting, for it recalls well- known verse of Sermon on Mount.

“A man buries treasure in deep pit, thinking: ‘It will be useful in time of need, or if king is displeased with me, or if I am robbed, or fall into debt, or if food is scarce, or bad luck befalls me.’ “But all this treasure may not profit owner at all, for he may forget where he hid it, or goblins may steal it, or his enemies or even his kinsmen may take it when he is not on his guard.

“But by charity, goodness, restraint and self-control man and woman alike cn store up well-hidden treasure—a treasure which cannot be given to others,17 and which robbers cannot steal. wise man should do good thatis treasure which will not leave him.”45[Page 285] Though passages quoted above cannot be dated with precision they r certainly pre-Christian, and there is no possibility of Christian influence.
The vow of Bodhisattva, which we hv already quoted (p. 275),gives sufficient indication of ethics of Great Vehicle, which teaches an impassioned altruism scarcely to be found elsewhere in literature of non-Christian world. Though Buddhist virtue of mettā seems often rather state of mind than spur to benevolent action, view that faith without works is dead is sometimes expressed, notably in story of Buddha and sick monk.

As Master was going on round of inspection, visiting monks in their cells, he found one who was sick with dysentery, and who had fallen from his bed and lay in his own ordure. With his own hands Buddhawashed sick man from head to foot, laid him comfortably on his bed,and gave new rule to Order:“Brethren, you hv no mother or father to care for you. If you do not care for one another who else will do so? Brethren, he who would care forme should care for sick.” 46
Though this precept applies primarily to Order of monks, it was nodoubt under influence of such teachings that Aśoka established free hospitals, and that Buddhist monks hv at all times studied medical lore,and treated laymen as well as their own fellows.

The Buddhist scriptures were chiefly written for and addressed to monks and nuns of order, but number of passages gave special instruction to layman, and first five of “Ten Precepts” (p. 281)were binding on lay community. acc to first of these noBuddhist could follow profession of hunter or butcher. vow not to take life was not generally interpreted as forbidding lawful warfare or thesentencing of criminals to death, and did not preclude Buddhists fromeating meat, if provided by non Buddhist butchers. But Buddhism tended toencourage mildness in justice and vegetarianism, and somewhat discouraged militarism which prevailed at most periods in ancient India(p. 123). _The second precept, not to take what is not given, included abstention not only from theft, but also from sharp practice in business._

For laymen third precept did not, of course, involve absolute celibacy, but permitted lawful marriage. It was usually interpreted as forbidding unnatural sexuality and extra-marital relations. Buddhism laid down no hard and fast rules on questions of marriage and divorce, and at present day in Buddhist countries marital laws r largely influenced by local custom. fourth [Page 286] precept, forbidding false speech,was taken to include lying, perjury and slander, while fifth forbadealcoholic drinks. Modern Buddhists often put rather liberal interpretationon this rule, and same may hv been done in ancient days, for in one sermon Buddha is said to hv classed only first four sins as “vices of action”, and to hv included drinking among six less reprehensible“openings for swallowing up of wealth”, others being roaming streets at unseasonable hours, frequenting festivals, gambling, keeping bad company and idling.

This sermon, most important Buddhist text on lay morality, is “Address to Sigala”, 47 in which Buddha gives instruction to young layman on his relations with his fellow men, and on duties of parentsand children, teachers and pupils, husbands and wives, and friends. It breathes spirit of warm affection and fellowship, not raised to an exalted spiritual level, but of an everyday practical type. text is too long to quote, and we cn only summarize some of its instructions.

Husbands should respect their wives, and comply as far as possible with their requests. They should not commit adultery. They should give their wives full charge of home, and supply dm with fine clothes and jewellery as far as their means permit. Wives should be thorough in their duties, gentle and kind to whole household, chaste, and careful in housekeeping, and should carry out their work with skill and enthusiasm.

A man should be generous to his friends, speak kindly of them, act in their interest in every way possible, treat dm as his equals, and keep his word to them. They in turn should watch over his interests and property,take care of him when he is “off his guard” (i.e. intoxicated, infatuated, or otherwise liable to commit rash and careless actions), stand by him and help him in time of trouble, and respect other members of his family.

Employers should treat their servants and workpeople decently. They should not be given tasks beyond their strength. They should receiveadequate food and wages, be cared for in time of sickness and infirmity, andbe given regular holidays and bonuses in times of prosperity. They shouldrise early and go to bed late in service of their master, be content withtheir just wages, work thoroughly, and maintain their master’s reputation.

Precepts such as these, which r implicit in teaching of other religions, r nowhere else so clearly and unequivocally expressed.

Specially noteworthy r duties of husbands to wives and of masters to servants, which seem to anticipate twentieth century ideas on rights of women and employees.

Among most important vehicles of Buddhist ethical teaching r Jataka stories. These r mostly of secular origin, and many [Page 287] merely inculcate shrewdness and caution in everyday life, as do Æsop’sfables [[Æsop's fables]] (e.g. that given in full on p. 454f). Others teach generosity and self-abnegation in morbidly exaggerated forms, for instance tale of KingŚivi (known also in Hinduism), who ransomed pigeon from famished hawk with flesh cut from his own thigh. Many European readers might well find very popular story of Prince Visvantara (Pali, Vessantara) distasteful. This prince gave away so much of his royal father’s treasure that he was banished with his wife and children in carriage drawn by fourhorses. As he left, he gave away carriage and horses for asking, and settled in hut in forest with his family. Soon he gave his children to wandering ascetic who needed dm to do his begging for him, and finally he disposed of his wife in similar manner. But all ended happily, for those who had asked him for his most precious possessions were gods in disguise,who had decided to test his generosity, and he was at last restored to his family and his patrimony (pl. XXVIII). But many of these old Buddhist stories r of highest ethical quality, such as that of monkey who saved lives of his fellows from king’s archers at risk of his own by making himself living bridge over Ganges, or that of noble parrot, who laid down his life for his friends, in futile attempt to quench aforest fire by drops of water scattered from his wings.


## (III) JAINISM AND OTHER UNORTHODOX SECTS
Jainism
Among many unorthodox teachers who were contemporary with theBuddha was Vardhamana, known to his followers as Mahāvīra (“the GreatHero”). Jainism, “Religion of Conquerors” ( jinas), which hefounded, had very different history from that of Buddhism. It succeeded inestablishing itself firmly, and in some places became very influential, but it never spread beyond India. Unlike Buddhism, there were no fundamental changes and developments in Jaina doctrine. But though history of Jainism is less interesting than that of Buddhism, and though it was neverso important, it survived in land of its birth, where it still has some twomillion adherents, mostly well-to-do merchants.

The legends of Vardhamāna Mahāvīra r less attractive than those of Buddha and r even more formalized and unreliable, but as he is referred to in Buddhist scriptures as one of Buddha’s chief opponents, hishistoricity is beyond doubt. He was born about 540 B.C. and was son ofSiddhārtha, chief of clan of Jñātrikas, [Page 288] associates of theLicchavis of Vaiśālī; his mother, Triśalā, was sister of Licchavi chief Cetaka, _and thus, like Buddha, he was wholly product of theoligarchic martial clans which were powerful political force at time._

Though he was educated as prince, and married and had daughter, his real interest lay in quest for salvation. At age of thirty, when hisparents were dead, he left his home for life of asceticism. At first he followed practices of an ascetic group called Nirgranthas (“Free from Bonds”), which had been founded some 200 years earlier by certain Pārśva. term Nirgrantha was later used for members of orderwhich Mahāvīra founded, and Pārśva was remembered as twentythird ofthe twenty-four great teachers or Tīrthaṅ karas (“Fordmakers”) of Jainafaith.

For over twelve years Vardhamana wandered from place to place, begging his bread, meditating, disputing, and subjecting his body to austerities of all kinds. At first he wore single garment, which he never changed, but after thirteen months he laid this encumbrance aside, and rest of his life was spent in complete nudity. For some six years his hardships were shared by another ascetic, Gosala Maskariputra, but ultimately two quarrelled, and Gosala left Vardhamana to found sect of Ajivikas.

In thirteenth year of his asceticism Vardhamana found full enlightenment and Nirvāṇa; he became “Worthy” ( Arhant), “Conqueror” ( Jina), “Ford-maker”’. He soon gained great reputation and large band of followers, and for thirty years he taught in Gangetic kingdoms, patronized by very kings who also patronized Buddha.

He survived death of his chief rival, Gosala, and probably also that of Buddha, and died of self-starvation at age of seventy-two, in little town of Pava, near Magadhan capital Rajagrha. There r conflicting traditions about date of his death, which was probably in 468 B.C.

For some two centuries Jainas remained small community of monks and lay followers, less important than rival sect of Ajivikas.

According to strongly held Jaina tradition Candragupta Maurya joined theorder as monk on his abdication, and it seems certain that there was anaccession of strength in Maurya times. serious famine at end ofCandragupta’s reign led to great exodus of Jaina monks from Gangesto Deccan, where they established important centres of their faith.

Out of this migration arose great schism of Jainism, on point of monastic discipline. Bhadrabahu, elder of community, who had led emigrants, had insisted on retention of rule of nudity, which Mahāvīra had established. Sthūlabhadra, leader of [Page 289] monks who had remained in North, allowed his followers to wear white garments, owing to hardships and confusions of famine. Hence arose two sects of Jainas, Digambaras (“Space-clad”, i.e. naked), and Śvetāmbaras (“White-clad”). schism did not become final until 1st century A.D., and there were never any fundamental doctrinal differences; later most monks of naked sect took to wearing robes in public, but division has persisted down to present day.

According to tradition an oral sacred literature had been passed down from days of Mahavlra, but Bhadrabahu was last person to know it perfectly. On his death Sthūlabhadra called great council at Pataliputra, and canon was reconstructed as best possible in twelve Aṅ gas, or sections, which replaced fourteen “former texts “( Pūrvas). This canonwas accepted only by Śvetāmbaras; Digambaras claimed that oldcanon was hopelessly lost, and proceeded to devise new scriptures forthemselves, many of which r still unpublished. texts of theSvetambara canon were finally settled and reduced to writing at council atValabhi in Kāthiāwār in 5th century A.D. By this time texts hadbecome very corrupt, and one of Aṅgas had been completely lost, whilenew material had been added to original canon in form of twelveUpāṅ gas, or minor sections, and various lesser works. In Middle Ages agreat body of commentarial literature was written both in Prakrit andSanskrit, and there were many able philosopher monks, who interpreted thescriptures of sect. Some monks turned their attention to secular literature and other branches of learning, apparently without losing theirpiety. One of last great poets in Sanskrit, Nayacandra, of 14thcentury (p. 431f), was Jaina monk, as was Mallinātha, author of standard commentary on poems of Kālidāsa. We owe much to Jainamonks’ love of literature. To copy manuscript, even secular one, was considered work of great religious merit, and thus old Jainamonasteries of Western India hv preserved many rare and otherwiseunknown texts, some of which hv still to be published, and many ofwhich r of non-Jaina origin.

In period between Mauryas and Guptas Jainism cn be traced from Orissā in East to Mathurā in West, but in later times it was chiefly concentrated in two regions—Kāthiāwār, Gujarat and parts ofRajasthan, where Svetambara sect prevailed, and central part of Peninsula, modern Mysore and South Hyderabad, where theDigambaras were dominant. Ganges Valley, original home ofJainism, was little affected by it. #quote prophet is never recognized in his time and land

The Svetambaras found much support among chiefs of Western [Page 290] India, and gained position of great prominence during reign of Caulukya king Kumārapāla, who ruled Gujarāt and Kāthiāwār in the12th century. Under guidance of great Jaina scholar, Hemacandra,Kumārapāla is said to hv instituted Jaina reformation; but on his deaththe sect lost much of its influence, and though it still flourished it neveragain became so important. Similarly in South Digambaras had great influence in early Middle Ages, thanks to patronage of manyimportant kings, but this influence gradually diminished as devotionalŚaivism and Vaisnavism grew. There r traditions, which some havedoubted, but which we believe to hv basis of fact, that Jainas weresometimes severely persecuted. But although Jainism declined it neverdisappeared.

Though Jaina scriptures r comparatively late in their final form, there is so little divergence in fundamentals between two great Jaina sects that it seems that basic teachings of both r very ancient indeed,and r essentially those of Mahavira himself. Jainism, like Buddhism, isfundamentally atheistic, in that, while not denying existence of gods,it refuses dm any important part in universal scheme. world, forthe Jaina, is not created, maintained or destroyed by personal deity, butfunctions only acc to universal law.

The universe is eternal. Its existence is divided into an infinite number ofcycles, each consisting of period of improvement ( utsarpiṇ ī), and one ofdecline (avasarpiṇī). Each period is to all intents and purposes like last,containing twenty-four Tirthankaras, twelve Universal Emperors( Cakravartins), altogether sixty-three Great Men( Śālāka-puruṣ as), who liveat regular intervals in cycle. At peak period men r of enormoussize and live to tremendous age. They hv no need of laws or property,for wishing-trees ( kalpa-vṛ kṣ a) give dm all they need for asking. Atpresent world is rapidly declining. last Tīrthaṅkara of this age haspassed to final Nirvāna, and gradually true religion will be lost—Mahāvīra,in his omniscience, even gave his followers name and address of lastJaina of this æon. process of decline will continue for 40,000 years,when men will be dwarfs in stature, with life of only twenty years, andwill dwell in caves, having forgotten all culture, even to use of fire.

Then tide will turn, and they will begin to improve again, only to decline once more, and so on for all eternity. Unlike cosmology of Buddhists and Hindus, that of Jainas involves no cataclysms of universal destruction.

The universe functions through interaction of living souls ( jivas, literally “lives”), and five categories of non-living entities ( ajiva): “ether” ( ākāśa), means or condition of movement [Page 291] ( dharma), means or condition of rest ( adharma), 18 time ( kāla), and matter ( pudgala).

Souls r not only property of animal and plant life, but also of entities such as stones, rocks, running water, and many other natural objects not looked on as living by other sects.

The soul is naturally bright, all-knowing and blissful. There r an infinite number of souls in universe, all fundamentally equal, but differing owing to adherence of matter in fine atomic form. This subtle matter, quite invisible to human eye, is karma, immaterial entity ofother systems interpreted materialistically. naturally bright soulbecomes dulled and clouded over by karmic matter and thus acquires first aspiritual and then material body. obfuscation of soul is comparedto gradual clouding of bright oily surface by motes of dust. Karma adheres to soul as result of activity. Any and every activity induceskarma of some kind, but deeds of cruel and selfish nature induce more andmore dangerous karma than others. karma already acquired leads to theacquisition of further karma, and thus cycle of transmigration continuesindefinitely.

On these premisses transmigration cn only be escaped by dispelling karma already adhering to soul and ensuring that no more is acquired.

This is slow and difficult process and it is believed that many souls willnever succeed in accomplishing it, but will continue to transmigrate for alleternity. annihilation ( nirjarā) of karma comes about through penance,and prevention ( saṃ vara) of influx ( āśrava) and fixation (bandha)19of karma in soul is ensured by carefully disciplined conduct, as resultof which it does not enter in dangerous quantities and is dispersedimmediately. When soul has finally set itself free it rises at once to thetop of universe, above highest heaven, where it remains in inactiveomniscient bliss through all eternity. This, for Jainas, is Nirvāṇa.

Though Jaina philosophers developed their doctrines, and evolved atheory of epistemology of great subtlety (p. 502f), these fundamentalteachings remained essentially unaltered. Mahavira and twenty-threeother Tīrthaṅkaras were adored in same way as Buddha and as theHindu gods, but Jainism never compromised in its atheism, and there wasno development in this sect comparable to Great Vehicle in Buddhism.

Jainism has survived for over 2,000 years on basis of these austere teachings alone.

[Page 292] Full salvation is not possible to layman. In this Jainism differs from Buddhism and Hinduism, which concede it in very exceptional cases. To attain Nirvana man must abandon all trammels, including his clothes. Only by long course of fasting, self-mortification, study andmeditation, cn he rid himself of karma, and only by most rigorousdiscipline cn he prevent fresh karma from entering his soul. Hence amonastic life is essential for salvation. Very early, however, many Jainamonks gave up rule of nudity, and today few if any monks, even of theDigambara sect, practise it regularly. Both sects of Jainas, however, wouldadmit that it is necessary to full salvation. universe is now rapidlydeclining, and no souls now reach Nirvana or hv any hope of reaching itin foreseeable future, so in these degenerate days clothes r worn as aconcession to human frailty.

The regimen of Jaina monk was, and still is, strict in extreme. At
his initiation his hair was not shaved, but pulled out by roots. He
subjected himself to many hardships, such as meditating in full sunlight
of Indian summer, or maintaining an uneasy posture for long periods on
end, though Jainism did not permit more spectacular penances of some
Hindu ascetics. monk’s frugal meals were interrupted by numerous
fasts, and many monks starved themselves to death, following example
of Mahavira himself.

The life of monk was governed by five vows, abjuring killing, stealing, lying, sexual activity and possession of property. These vows were interpreted quite strictly. Acts of violence and killing, whether intentional or not, were most potent cause of influx of karma, and were therefore particularly to be avoided. Meat-eating was quite forbidden to monk and layman alike. Even insect life was carefully protected. Like theBuddhist monks, Jainas strained their drinking-water to save lives ofanimalculæ. Jaina monks usually carried feather dusters, to brush ants andother insects from their path and save dm from being trampled underfoot,and they wore veils over their mouths, to prevent minute living things inthe air from being inhaled and killed. No lay Jaina could take up theprofession of agriculture, since this involved not only destruction ofplant life, but also of many living things in soil. Thus, in its insistenceon ahimsa, or non-violence, Jainism went much further than any otherIndian religion.

It has been suggested that Jainism survived in India, whereas Buddhismperished, because former sect took better care of its layfolk. Jainamonks perhaps paid greater attention to laymen than did Buddhists,and in Jainism layman was definite member of Order, encouragedto undertake periodical retreats, [Page 293] and to live as far as possible thelife of monk for specified periods. Like Buddhism, Jainism encouragedthe commercial virtues of honesty and frugality, and at very early periodthe Jaina lay community became predominantly mercantile. splendidJaina temples at such places as Mount Abu and Sravana Belgola aretestimonies of great wealth and piety of medieval Jaina laymen.

Jainism had no special social doctrines. domestic rites of layman,such as birth, marriage and death, were those of Hindus. At one timeJainism maintained cult of stśpas, in same way as Buddhism, but thishas not survived, and early in Christian era Tīrthaṅkaras wereadored in temples in form of icons. By Middle Ages this worshipapproximated to that of Hindus, with offerings of flowers, incense,lamps and so on. As with Buddhism, chief gods of Hindus foundtheir way into Jaina temples in subordinate positions, and though there wasno real compromise with theism sect easily fitted into Hindu order,its members forming distinct castes.

Jaina religious literature is generally dull, and often pedantic, and itsethics, though they inculcate such virtues as honesty and mercy, tend to benegative and fundamentally selfish. virtue of nonviolence in Jainismoften had little of love about it, but merely involved vegetarianism, andprecautions against accidental killing of small animals. There are,however, passages in Jaina scriptures which show warmth and humansympathy. Thus, discussing doctrine of non-violence, earlyĀcārāṅ ga Sūtra writes:
“A wise man should be neither glad nor angry, for he should know and consider happiness of all things…. Life is dear to many who ownfields and houses, who get dyed and coloured clothes and jewels andearrings, and grow attached to them…. Only those who r of controlledconduct do not desire these things; therefore, knowing birth and death, youshould firmly walk path.

“For nothing is inaccessible to death, and all beings r fond ofthemselves, they love pleasure and hate pain, they shun destruction andcling to life. They long to live. To all things life is dear.”48More typical of Jaina moral teachings r following verses, said tohave been spoken by Mahāvīra to Gautama, one of his disciples (not, ofcourse, to be confused with Gautama Buddha).

“As dead leaf when its time is up falls from tree to ground, so is life of man.

Gautama, always be watchful!

[Page 294] “As dewdrop that sways on blade of grass lasts but moment, so is life of man.

Gautama, always be watchful!

“For soul which suffers for its carelessness
is whirled about in universe,
through good and evil karma.

Gautama, always be watchful!

“When body grows old and hair turns white,
and all vital powers decrease…
despondency and disease befall, and flesh wastes and decays.

Gautama, always be watchful!

“So cast away all attachments,
and be pure as lotus, or as water in autumn.

Free from every attachment,
Gautama, always be watchful!” 49
As an example of Digambara teaching we give few verses, remarkable
for their conciseness, by 4th century monk Pūjyapāda.

“Body, house, wealth and wife,
sons and friends and enemies—
all r different from soul.

Only fool thinks dm his own.”

“From all directions come birds
and rest together in trees;
but in morning each goes his own way,
flying in all directions.”

“Death is not for me. Why then should I fear?

Disease is not for me. Why then should I despair?

I am not child, nor youth, nor an old man—
All these states r only of my body.”

“Time and again in my foolishness I hv enjoyed
all kinds of body and hv discarded them.

Now I am wise!

Why should I long for rubbish?”

“The soul is one thing, matter another—
that is quintessence of truth.

Whatever else may be said
is merely its elaboration.”50

### Ājivikas
A third unorthodox sect which emerged at same time as Buddhism and Jainism was that of Ājivikas, body of ascetics who [Page 295]were under rigorous discipline similar to that of Jainas, whichinvolved complete nudity. doctrines of founder of sect, GosalaMaskariputra, bear generic likeness to those of his contemporary andformer friend Mahavira. Like Mahavira, he looked back to earlier teachersand ascetic groups, whose doctrines he refurbished and developed.

According to both Buddhist and Jaina tradition he was of humble birth; hedied year or so before Buddha, about 484 B.C., after fierce altercationwith Mahavira in city of Śrśvastī. His followers seem to hv combined with those of other teachers, such as Pūraṇa Kāśyapa antinomian andPakudha Kātyāyana atomist, to form Ājivika sect. After period ofprosperity in Mauryan times, when Aśoka and his successor Daśaratha presented caves to Ājivikas, sect rapidly declined, and only retainedsome local importance in small region of Eastern Mysore and adjacentparts of Madras, where it survived until 14th century, after which wehear no more of it.

No scriptures of Ājivikas hv come down to us, and little weknow about dm has to be reconstructed from polemic literature ofBuddhism and Jainism. sect was certainly atheistic, and its main featurewas strict determinism. usual doctrine of karma taught that though aman’s present condition was determined by his past actions he couldinfluence his destiny, in this life and future, by choosing right courseof conduct. This Ajivikas denied. whole universe was conditionedand determined to smallest detail by an impersonal cosmic principle,Niyati, or destiny. It was impossible to influence course oftransmigration in any way.

“All that hv breath, all that r born, all that hv life, r without power, strength or virtue, but r developed by destiny, chance and nature,and experience joy and sorrow in six classes [of existence]. There are…8,400,000 great æons ( mahākappa), through which fool and wise alike musttake their course and make an end of sorrow. There is no [question of]bringing unripe karma to fruition, nor of exhausting karma already ripened,by virtuous conduct, by vows, by penance, or by chastity. That cannot bedone. Samsara is measured as with bushel, with its joy and sorrow and itsappointed end. It cn neither be lessened nor increased, nor is there anyexcess or deficiency of it. Just as ball of string will, when thrown, unwindto its full length, so fool and wise alike will take their course, and make anend of sorrow.”51

Though nothing that man could do would in any way influence his future lot Ajivika monks practised severe asceticism, because force of destiny compelled dm to do so, although their religious opponents accused dm of licentiousness and immorality.

The Dravidian Ājivikas developed their doctrines in way [Page 296] resembling Buddhism of Great Vehicle. Gosala became an ineffable divinity, like Buddha in Mahayana system, while doctrine of destiny evolved into Parmenidean view that all change and movement were illusory, and that world was in reality eternally and immovably at rest. This view bears certain resemblance to Nāgārjuna’s doctrine of “the Void”.

### Scepticism and Materialism.

Buddha, Mahavira, Gosala, and many lesser teachers of their period ignored gods, but they were not thoroughgoing atheists and materialists.

All admitted existence of supernatural beings of strictly limited powers,and all accepted fundamental doctrine of transmigration, though they interpreted its mechanics individually. Some thinkers, however, rejected all immaterial categories completely, and their influence may hv been widerthan appears from religious texts of period. In fairly early KathaUpanisad interlocutor Naciketas (p. 157) questions Yama, god ofdeath, in these terms: “There is doubt about state of man who is dead -some say he is, others, he is not.” “On this point”, Yama replies, “even thegods formerly had their doubts. It is not easy to understand.” At this timeunbelief must hv been fairly widespread.

Ajita Kesakambalin (Ajita of Hair-blanket, no doubt so called from garb of his order), contemporary of Buddha, was earliest known teacher of complete materialism.

“Man,” he said, “is formed of four elements. When he dies earthreturns to aggregate of earth, water to water, fire to fire, and air toair, while his senses vanish into space. Four men with bier take upthe corpse; they gossip [about dead man] as far as burning-ground, where his bones turn colour of dove’s wing and hissacrifices end in ashes. They r fools who preach almsgiving, andthose who maintain existence [of immaterial categories] speak vain

and lying nonsense. When body dies both fool and wise alike r cut off and perish. They do not survive after death.” 52If we r to believe Buddhist scriptures, Ajita founded sect ofmonks. Buddha condemned dm as having no good motive for theirasceticism, degree of which is nowhere made clear. It is possible that,like Epicureans, they were not so much an ascetic order as fraternityof men with common aims, cultivating together simpler pleasures oflife. In any case, an undercurrent of materialism is traceable in Indianthought from this time onwards. Religious and philosophical literature,whether Hindu, Buddhist or Jaina, devotes much space to attacking eviltenets of Cārvākas [Page 297] or Lokāyatas, as materialist schoolswere called. Throughout period which we treat these unbelievers arereferred to with scorn and disapprobation, which sometimes seems tocontain an undertone of fear, as though pious authors thought it reallypossible that materialists might shake foundations of establishedorder. Materialist and irreligious undercurrents r traceable in some secularliterature, such as Arthaśāstra and Kāmasūtra.

The general attitude of materialist schools, acc to their adversaries, was that all religious observance and morality were futile. man should make most of life and get what happiness he could out of it.

The frugal virtues of Buddhism and Jainism were rejected.

“As long as he lives man should live happily and drink ghee, though he run into debt, for when body is turned to ashes how cn there be any return to life?”53 man must not turn back from pleasure for fear of concomitant sorrow. He must accept occasional sorrow gladly, for sake of joy which he finds in world, as he accepts bones with fish or husk with corn.

“Whoever turns in fear from joy that he sees before him is fool, no better than an animal.” 54 Their opponents ascribe only base ideals to materialists, and there is no definite evidence that they had any ethical doctrines, but one verse attributed to dm shows that they were not blind to warm ties of family and friendship.

“If man really left his body,and passed on to other world,would he not come back once more,drawn by his love for his kin?”55Besides numerous quotations attributed to materialists in religious andphilosophical works one materialist philosophical text has survived. This isthe Tattvopaplavasiṃ ha (freely “The Lion Destroying all Religious Truth”)written by certain Jayarasi in 8th century A.D. author was an out-and-out Pyrrhonist denying possibility of any certain knowledge at all,and he demolished with able dialectic, to his own satisfaction at any rate, allthe basic presuppositions of chief religious systems of his day.



## (IV) HINDUISM
Development and Literature
As well as aristocratic religion of brāhmaṇs, Buddhist and Jaina scriptures mention popular cults, connected with earth [Page 298] spirits ( yakṣ as), snake-spirits ( nāgas), and other minor deities, centred round sacred spots or caityas (p. 262). Very early god named Vasudeva was widely worshipped, especially in Western India. It was to this god thatthe Besnagar column, to which we hv more than once referred, waserected. inscription on column shows that by end of 2ndcentury B.C. cult of Vasudeva was receiving support of rulingclasses, and even of Western invaders. Soon after this Vasudeva wasidentified with Vedic god Viṣṇu, if indeed identification had notalready been made, and further syncretisms were taking place. Nārāyaṇa, agod of obscure origin mentioned in Brāhmaṇa literature, was alsoidentified with Viṣṇu, whose name was by now closely connected with thatof Krsna, one of heroes of martial traditions which were beingbrought together at this time to form great epic, Mahābhārata.

The character of Viṣṇu, and of gods associated with him, developedthrough centuries, as further popular divinities were in one way oranother identified with him. Among some of lower orders theriomorphiccults prevailed, especially in Eastern Mālwā, where divinity in form ofa boar was worshipped. By Gupta times cult of divine boar wasassimilated to that of Visnu. pastoral flute-playing deity, popular amongherdsmen and of uncertain origin, was identified with hero Krsna, bynow recognized as an incarnation of Viṣṇu. brahmanic heroParaśurāma was similarly accounted for, while in medieval times heroof second great Indian epic, Rama, was also brought into Vaisnavite pantheon.

Simultaneously fertility deity, whose cult may hv been kept alive innon-brahmanic circles from days of Harappā culture, rose inprominence. This was Siva, identified with Vedic Rudra and usuallyworshipped in form of phallic emblem ( linga). With Śiva were laterassociated certain other popular divinities, such as Skanda and elephant-headed Gaṇeśa. At end of Gupta period goddesses rose toprominence, together with magical cults, religious sexuality, and animalsacrifice in new form, which increased in importance throughout earlyMiddle Ages.

The final form of Hinduism was largely result of influence from Dravidian South. Here, on basis of indigenous cults fertilized by Āryaninfluences, theistic schools had arisen, characterized by intense ecstaticpiety. It was this devotional Hinduism, propagated by many wanderingpreachers and hymn-singers in medieval period, which had greatesteffect on Hinduism as it exists today.

During this period an enormous body of sacred literature was produced.

The Vedas, Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, theoretically still [Page 299]most sacred of all India’s religious literature, were studied only by thosewho had undergone ceremony of initiation, and became more and morethe preserve of brāhmaṇs, who themselves often interpreted themfiguratively in light of new doctrines. real scriptures ofHinduism, as distinct from brahmanism, were available to all, even to menof low caste and to women. These were Epics, Purāṇ as, booksof Sacred Law, which we hv treated elsewhere (p. 112f), and numeroushymns and religious poems. For learned there was voluminousliterature of commentaries, and many treatises on various aspects oftheology and philosophy.

The two great Epics were originally secular, and in their literary aspect
will be treated later (p. 407f). Very early, probably before Christian era, Mahābhārata began to receive religious interpolations, and was soon looked on as sacred text. most sacred of these interpolations is thefamous Bhagavad Gītā, itself compilation of material from varioussources, to which we shall often refer in course of this chapter; butmuch literature on Sacred Law, as well as religious legends of manykinds, has found its way into Epic which, as it exists at present, formsan encyclopedia of early Hinduism. An important appendix to theMahābhārata is Harivaṃ sa, giving legend of god Krsna in adeveloped form. second epic, Rāmāyaṇ a, was also secular in itsearliest form, but at comparatively late period, probably after age ofthe Guptas, an introductory and final canto were added, together withother interpolations, which raised text to status of sacred scripture.

The Puranas (“Ancient Stories”) r compendia of legends and religious instructions. There r eighteen chief Puranas of which perhaps most important r Vāyu, Viṣṇ u, Agni, Bhaviṣ ya and Bhāgavata Purāṇ as. In their present form they r not very ancient, none going back earlier than Gupta period and all containing interpolations, but much of their legendary material is very old indeed.

Much later religious poetry is of small literary value, and has little more sanctity than hv “Hymns Ancient and Modern” in Church of England.

Certain poems, however, r looked on by modern sects as very sacred,especially Gītā Govinda, collection of interlinked religious songs bythe 12th-century Bengali poet Jayadeva (p. 428f). Some medieval stotras orhymns of praise, notably those attributed to theologian Śaṅkara, haveconsiderable literary merit, and r looked on with great respect. ThePeninsula produced much vernacular sacred poetry during our period, someof which is of great value, and is considered to be very holy. [Page 300] Abeautiful collection of moral aphorisms in Tamil verse, Tirukkural(“Sacred Couplets”), attributed to Tiruvalluvar, perhaps dates from 4thor 5th centuries A.D., though some authorities would put it much earlier.

Later, from 7th to 10th centuries, were composed eleven sacred books ( Tirumurai) of Tamil Saivites, anthologies of hymns by sixty- three Nāyanārs, or Teachers. Chief of these eleven works r Tevāram, containing songs by three poets Appar, Ñānasambandar, and Sundaramūrti, and Tiruvāśagam of Māṇikka Vāśagar. TamilVaiṣṇavites at about same period produced Ndldyiram (“FourThousand”), collection of stanzas attributed to twelve Alvars or saintsof sect. Similar collections of devotional poetry, still looked on locallyas very sacred, were composed at end of our period in Canarese andTelugu. At later time much devotional literature was written in Āryanvernaculars, but none survives from period before Musliminvasions, except perhaps works of some of Maratha Vaisnavitehymn singers, Jfinnesvar, Namdev and few others, who, acc totradition, lived at end of 13th century.

We cannot here catalogue great mass of religio-philosophical literature of Hinduism, some of which will be mentioned in followingpages.

Visnu
To Vaisnavite, or devotee of Visnu, this god is source of universe and of all things. acc to most famous cosmic myth of Hinduism he sleeps in primeval ocean, on thousand-headed snake Sesa. In his sleep lotus grows from his navel, and in lotus is born thedemiurge Brahma,20 who creates world. Once world is created Visnuawakes, to reign in highest heaven, Vaikuntha. He is usually depicted asa four-armed man of dark blue colour, crowned and seated on his throne,bearing in his hands his emblems, conch, discus, mace and lotus,wearing holy jewel called Kaustubha round his neck, and with tuft ofcurly hair ( Srivatsa) on his chest. He rides great eagle Garuda, generallyshown with half-human face, who is perhaps survival of an ancienttheriomorphic cult, and who was already associated with Vasudeva, one ofVisnu’s early forms, when Heliodorus erected his column at Besnagar.

Visnu’s spouse, Laksmi, is an important goddess in her own right.

Visnu’s status as Universal God, of whom all other gods r aspects or emanations, appears as early as Bhagavad Gītā.

[Page 301] “Now I will tell chief of my holy powers….

though there is no end to my fullness.

I am self in inmost heart of all that r born….

I am their beginning, their middle and their end….

I am beginning, middle, end, of all creation,
the science of soul among sciences,
of speakers I am speech,
of letters I am A. 21
“I am unending time,
I am ordainer who faces all ways,
I am destroying death,
I am source of all that is to be….

I am dice-play of gamester,
I am glory of glorious,
I am victory, I am courage,
I am goodness of virtuous….

I am force of those who govern,
I am statecraft of those who seek to conquer,
I am silence of what is secret,
I am knowledge of those who know,
and I am seed of all that is born….

“There is nothing that cn exist without me.

There is no end to my holy powers…
And whatever is mighty or fortunate or strong
springs from portion of my glory.”56
Though his counterpart Śiva has rather ferocious and dangerous side to
his character, Visnu is generally thought of as wholly benevolent. god
works continuously for welfare of world, and with this in view has
from time to time incarnated himself, wholly or partially. earliest
version of this doctrine is contained in Bhagavad Gītā, wherein Krsna
reveals himself as ever-active godhead incarnate.

“In essence I am never born, I never alter.

I am lord of all beings
and full master of my own nature,
yet of my own power I come to be.

“Whenever Sacred Law fails, and evil raises its head,
I take embodied birth.

To guard righteous and root out sinners,
and to establish Sacred Law,
I am born from age to age.” 57
[Page 302] Avataras (“descents”) or incarnations of Visnu are,
according to most popular classification, ten. divinities and heroes
composing list were adopted by Vaisnavism at different times, but all
were incorporated by 1 th century. It may be that Vaisnavite doctrine
of incarnation owes something to Buddhist and Jaina doctrines of
former Buddhas and Tirthaikaras, which r certainly attested earlier. An
incarnation might be total or partialfor “whatever is mighty or fortunate or
strong springs from portion of my glory.” In this sense every good or great
man was thought of as partial incarnation of Visnu. ten chief
incarnations, however, r of more special type, for in dm god is
believed to hv taken flesh to save world from imminent danger of
total destruction. They r as follows:
(1) Fish ( Matsya). When earth was overwhelmed by universal
flood Visnu took form of fish, who first warned Manu (the Hindu
Adam) of impending danger, and then carried him, his family, and the
seven great sages ( rsis) in ship, fastened to horn on his head. He also
saved Vedas from flood. fish legend first appears in the
brāhmanas, and Noah’s Ark theme suggests Semitic influence. Fish
incarnation was never widely worshipped.

(2) Tortoise ( Kurma). Many divine treasures were lost in flood,
including ambrosia ( amrta), 22 with which gods preserved their
youth. Visnu became great tortoise, and dived to bottom of cosmic
ocean. On his back gods placed Mount Mandara, and, twining divine
snake Vasuki around mountain, churned ocean in manner in
which an Indian dairyman churns butter, twirling mountain by pulling
the snake. From churned ocean emerged ambrosia, and various other
treasures, including goddess Laksmī. story is probably piece of
very early folklore, but identification of tortoise with Visnu is
comparatively late, and, though frequently mentioned in literature, this
incarnation had little real importance.

(3) Boar ( Varāha). demon, Hiraniyāksa, cast earth once more
into depths of cosmic ocean. Visnu took form of an enormous
boar, killed demon, and raised earth on his tusk (pl. XXXVII c). The
legend looks back to brāhmanas, but probably developed through a
primitive non-Āryan cult of sacred pig. cult of Boar incarnation
was important in some parts of India in Gupta times.

(4) Man-Lion ( Narasimha). Another demon, Hiranya [Page 303]
kasipu, had obtained boon from Brahma ensuring that he could not be
killed either by day or night by god, man or beast. Thus safeguarded he
persecuted both gods and men, including his pious son Prahlada. When
Prahlada called on Visnu for help god burst from pillar of demon’s
palace at sunset, when it was neither night nor day, in form half man and
half lion, and slew Hiranyakasipu. Narasimha was worshipped as their
special divinity ( istadevatā) by small sect, and was often depicted in
sculpture.

(5) Dwarf ( Vāmana). demon named Bali gained control of the
world, and commenced course of asceticism, by which his supernatural
power so increased that he menaced even gods. Visnu appeared before
him in form of dwarf, and asked as boon as much land as he could
cover in three strides. When boon was granted god became giant,
and in three strides covered earth, heaven and middle air, leaving only
the infernal regions to demon. three steps of Visnu r as old as the
Ṛ g Veda, but other popular elements were incorporated into story.

(6) Parasurāma (Rāma with Axe). Visnu took human form as son
of brahman Jamadagni. When his father was robbed by wicked King
Kartavirya, Paraśurāma killed latter. Jamadagni was in turn killed by the
sons of Kartavirya, after which enraged Paraśurāma destroyed all the
males of ksatriya class twenty-one times in succession. Though
Paraśurāma is frequently referred to in literature, he seems rarely to have
been specially worshipped.

(7) Rama, Prince of Ayodhya and hero of Rāmāyana. Visnu
incarnated himself in this form to save world from oppressions of
the demon Rāvana. To European his story is rather matter of literature
than of religion and will be told in later chapter (p. 412ff). Rāma may
have been chief who lived in 8th or 7th century B.C., and in earliest
form of story he has no divine attributes. Though he was believed to be
an earlier incarnation than Krsna, his cult developed later than Krsna’s, and
does not appear to hv been very important until end of our period.

Rāma is usually depicted as of dark hue, often bearing bow and arrow. He
is attended by his faithful wife Sita, personification of wifely devotion,
and often also by his three loyal brothers, Laksmana, Bharata and
Śatrughna, and by his friend and helper, monkey-god Hanumant. To his
devotees Rama combines ideals of gentle, faithful husband, the
leader brave in hardship, and just and benevolent king. It is perhaps
significant that his cult only became really popular after Muslim
invasion.

(8) Krsna was undoubtedly most important of incarnations of
Visnu. His legend in its final form is very long and cn only be outlined
briefly here.

[Page 304] Krsna was born at Mathurā, of tribe of Yadavas. His
father was Vasudeva, and his mother was Devaki, aunt of ruling
King Kamsa. It was prophesied that Kamsa would be killed by Devaki’s
eighth son, so he set out to destroy all her children. But Krsna and his elder
brother Balarāma were saved, and were brought up as children of thecowherd Nanda and his wife Yasoda. Kamsa, hearing that boys hadescaped his clutches, ordered slaughter of all male children in hiskingdom, but Nanda smuggled boys away, first to Vraja and then toVrndavana, districts not far from Mathurā which r still very sacred toKrsna.In his childhood incarnate god performed many miracles, killingdemons, and sheltering cowherds from storm by holding MountGovardhana over their heads with his finger; he also played numerouschildish pranks, such as stealing Yasoda’s butter. In his adolescence he hadmany amours with wives and daughters of cowherds ( gopis), andaccompanied their dances on his flute. His favourite was beautifulRadha.But his youthful days soon ended. Kamsa traced him and made furtherattempts on his life. Krsna then gave up his idyllic pastoral life, and turnedon his wicked cousin. He slew Kamsa, and seized kingdom of Mathurā,but, pressed between Kamsa’s father-in-law, Jarasandha king of Magadha,	and an unnamed Yavana king of North-West, he was forced to leave hiskingdom, and with his followers founded new capital at Dvaraka inKathiawar. Here he made Rukmini, daughter of king of Vidarbha(modern Berar), his chief queen, and amassed total of over 16,000 wivesand 180,000 sons. His adventures at this stage of his career include thedestruction of wicked kings and demons all over India. Throughout thestory of Mahdbhdrata he appears as constant friend and advisor ofthe five Pandavas, and he preached great sermon of Bhagavad Gitato Arjuna before battle which is centre of epic story.After seeing Pandavas safely installed in Kuru land, Krsnareturned to Dvaraka. Here ominous portents beset city, as Yadavachiefs quarrelled among themselves. Krsna banned strong drink, in hopeof staving off evil day, but, on occasion of festival, he relaxed theban. Yadava chiefs began to brawl, and whole city was soon inuproar. Krsna, for all his divinity, could do nothing to quell feud, whichinvolved whole people. His son Pradyumna was killed before his eyes,and his faithful brother BalaRāma wounded to death; nearly all chiefs ofthe Yadavas were slain. Krsna dejectedly wandered in forest near city;there, as he sat musing on loss of his friends and family, hunter spiedhim through undergrowth and mistook him for deer. An arrow piercedhis heel, which, like that of Achilles, was his one vulnerable spot, and hedied. city of Dvaraka was then swallowed by sea.Of many elements which hv gone to making of this story that ofKrsna as hero was earliest to hv been given place in orthodoxtradition. Krsna son of Devaki is mentioned as early as Upanisads58as studying new doctrines of soul, and it [Page 305] seems certainthat there is some historical basis for legend of hero-god; butevidently tales of many heroes from many ages and many parts of Indiahave been fused together in Krsna myth, including some which seemrather inconsistent with general character of conquering hero, suchas that of his somewhat ignominious retreat from Mathurā. Other elementsin story, such as destruction of Yadavas and death of god,are quite un-Indian in their tragic character. themes of drunkenbrawl leading to general slaughter, of hero slain by an arrow piercing hisone vulnerable spot, and of great city engulfed by sea, r wellknown in European epic literature, but do not occur elsewhere in that ofIndia, and r not hinted at in Vedas. concept of dying god, sowidespread in ancient Near East, is found nowhere else in Indianmythology. Kamsa, wicked cousin, seems to echo Herod, and perhapsalso Acrisius, cruel grandfather of Perseus. Some parts of story maybe derived from very ancient stories, handed down and developed by Āryanwarriors from days before they entered India; others r of indigenousorigin; and yet others r possibly inspired by garbled versions of tales fromthe West.Krsna in his pastoral and erotic aspect is evidently of different originfrom Krsna hero. name means “black”, and god is usuallydepicted as of that colour. Perhaps oldest clear reference to pastoralKrsna is in early Tamil anthologies, where “the Black One” ( Mayin)plays his flute and sports with milkmaids. He may hv been originally afertility god of Peninsula, whose cult was carried to North bynomadic tribes of herdsmen. tribe which appeared in Malwa and theWestern Deccan early in Christian era, Abhiras, is thought to haveplayed big part in propagation of worship of Krsna Govinda(“Lord of Herdsman”, 23 very common epithet of god in this aspect).The young Krsna’s erotic exploits hv been source of much romanticliterature which, superficially, contains but faint religious element.Invariably, however, love of god for cowherds’ wives isinterpreted as symbolic of love of God for human soul. notes ofKrsna’s flute, calling women to leave their husbands’ beds and dancewith him in moonlight, represent voice of God, calling man to leaveearthly things and turn to joys of divine love. So Jew and Christian alikehave interpreted Song of Songs, and so many mystical poets of allreligions hv depicted their spiritual experience. Despite its luxurianteroticism legend [Page 306] of Divine Cowherd has produced greatreligious poetry (p. 428f), and inspired many pious souls.The third element of Krsna legend is that of child god. This isdefinitely latest part to be assimilated, and its origin is quite unknown.Can it be partly inspired by tales brought by Christian merchants orNestorian missionaries to west coast of India in early Middle Ages?Most authorities would deny this, but we do not reject possibility out ofhand. In any case, story of child Krsna, often depicted in latersculpture as plump infant crawling on all fours, gave god rarecompleteness. As hero he met worshipper’s need of divine father andelder brother; as young cowherd, he was divine lover; and as infant, ason. cult of child Krsna made special appeal to warmmaternity of Indian womanhood; and even today simpler women ofIndia, while worshipping divine child, so delightfully naughty despitehis mighty power, refer to themselves as “the Mother of God”.Vasudeva, popular god of Western India in early centuries B.C.,was early identified with Krsna, and it may be that name, falselyinterpreted as patronymic, resulted in tradition that Krsn. a’s fatherwas called Vasudeva (with short in first syllable). Other deities,originally independent, were associated with Krsna in one way and another.Chief of these was his elder brother Balarama, also called Halayudha (”Armed with Plough”) and Sankarsana. Balarama, bearing woodenplough on his shoulder, was originally an agricultural deity. Traditionally hewas heavy drinker, and had some of characteristics of Silenus.Temples to him existed at one time, but his importance waned in MiddleAges, as that of Krsna increased. Less important were cults of Krsna’sson Pradyumna, of his grandson Aniruddha, and of his friend Arjuna, thePandava hero. chief feminine associate of Krsna was Rādhā, thefavourite mistress of his youth, who was often worshipped with him in thelate Middle Ages. Rukminī, his chief queen, also received some reverence.(9) Buddha, last historical incarnation of Visnu. acc to mosttheologians god became Buddha in order to delude wicked, leadthem to deny Vedas, and thus ensure their damnation. Jayadeva’s GītāGovinda, however, which contains one of earliest lists of incarnations,states that Visnu became Buddha out of compassion for animals, 59 in orderto put an end to bloody sacrifice. This probably gives clue to truebackground of Buddha avatāra. He was included in list, as otherdeities were included, in order to assimilate heterodox elements into theVaisnavite fold: Until quite recently temple of Buddha at Gayā wasin [Page 307] hands of Hindus, and teacher was there worshipped byHindus as Hindu god; but in general little attention was paid to theBuddha avatara.(10) Kalkin, incarnation yet to come. At end of this dark ageVisnu will appear in form of man mounted on white horse, with aflaming sword in his hand. He will judge wicked, reward good, andrestore age of gold. This is late addition to Vaisnavite myth, and doesnot play very important part in literature or iconography, though it is saidthat many simple Hindus hv taken Kalkin very seriously, and long forhis arrival just as oldfashioned Christians look forward to secondcoming of Christ. Christian parallels hv been found, especially with thehorseman of Book of Revelation, 60 but main inspiration of theKalkin may hv come from Buddhism, which taught coming ofMaitreya Buddha long before Vaisnavites devised Kalkin.Zoroastrian ideas may also hv helped in formation of myth.ŚivaAlmost as popular as numerous forms of Visnu was Śiva, whoevolved from fierce Vedic god Rudra (p. 238), with whom mergedelements of non-Āryan fertility deity. Though developed Śaivite sectsoften made of their chosen divinity wholly moral and paternal father inheaven, giva’s character, unlike that of Visnu, is ambivalent. He lurks inhorrible places, such as battlefields, burning-grounds and crossroads,which, in India as in Europe, were looked on as very inauspicious. Hewears garland of skulls and is surrounded by ghosts, evil spirits anddemons. He is death and time ( Mahakkla), which destroy all things.But he is also great ascetic, and patron deity of ascetics generally.On high slopes of Himalayan Mount Kailasa Śiva, great yogi,sits on tiger skin, deep in meditation, and through his meditation worldis maintained. He is depicted thus as wearing his long matted hair ( jata) in atopknot, in which crescent moon is fixed, and from which flows thesacred river Ganges. In middle of his forehead is third eye, emblem ofhis superior wisdom and insight. His neck is black, scarred by adeadlypoison which was last of objects churned from cosmicocean, and which he drank to save other gods from destruction. Snakes,of which he is lord, encircle his neck and arms. His body is coveredwith ashes, favourite ascetic practice. Beside him is his weapon, thetrident, while near him r his beautiful wife Pārvatī and his mount, bullNandi.Though in this aspect giva is continually wrapped in meditation, he [Page308] can, in his divine power, divide his personality. Not only is he godof mystical stillness, but also Lord of Dance ( Nataraja) (pl. LXVI).This aspect of giva is specially popular in Tamil country, wherereligious dancing was part of earliest known Tamil tradition. In hisheavenly palace on Mount Kailasa, or in his southern home, temple ofCidambaram or Tillai (near seacoast about fifty miles south ofPondicherry), mystically identified with Kailasa, Śiva dances. He hasinvented no less than 108 different dances, some calm and gentle, othersfierce, orgiastic and terrible. Of latter most famous is tandava, inwhich angry god, surrounded by his drunken attendants ( ganas), beatsout wild rhythm which destroys world at end of cosmic cycle.A further form in which god is worshipped is known as “South-facing” ( Daksinamurti) (pl. LXVIII); in this aspect he is universalteacher, depicted in an informal pose, with one foot on ground and theother on throne on which he sits, and with one hand raised in gestureof explanation. This form of Śiva perhaps owes something to Buddhistinspiration.But Śiva was and still is chiefly worshipped in form of liiga (pl.XXVIb), usually short cylindrical pillar with rounded top, which is thesurvival of cult older than Indian civilization itself. Phalli hv been foundin Harappā remains. Early Tamil literature refers to setting up ofritual posts, which seem to hv been phallic emblems. cult of thelifiga, at all times followed by some of non-Āryan peoples, wasincorporated into Hinduism around beginning of Christian era,though at first it was not very important. As early as Ṛ g Veda, Rudra,the mountain god, was connected with plants and animals. hornedithyphallic god of Mohenjo Daro, surrounded by animals, may well be theprototype of Siva, as patron of reproduction in men, animals and plants.In this form he is known as Paśupati (“Lord of Beasts”) and is oftenrepresented in South India as four armed man, with one hand in anattitude of blessing, second open, as though bestowing boon, an axe inthe third, and small deer springing from fingers of fourth (pl.LXVIIb).Some Saivite sects declare that Śiva has performed series of avataras,but these r pure imitations of those of Visnu and hv never played bigpart in Saivite thought. god has, however, manifested himself fromtime to time in theophanies, or taken temporary incarnation to destroydemons or test virtue of warriors or sages. Numerous legends r told ofhim, some of dm quite uncomplimentary. most famous of theselegends is that of his [Page 309] marriage to Pārvatī, daughter ofHimalaya, personified mountains.The gods were troubled by demon Taraka, and it was prophesied that hecould only be destroyed by child of Śiva and Daughter of theMountains. But Śiva was continually wrapped in meditation, and theprospect of his producing offspring seemed to other gods to be faintindeed. However Pārvatī, beautiful daughter of Himalaya, was sent attheir behest to wait upon Siva, but though she made many attempts to winthe god’s attention he took no notice of her, and in course of her effortsKama, lovegod, who had done his best to help her to win him, was burntto ashes by flames from Siva’s third eye. At last Plrvati decided tofollow god in his asceticism. Laying aside her ornaments she became ahermitess on nearby peak, and in this guise Śiva noticed her and fell inlove with her. They were married at great ceremony at which all godstook part, and soon Pārvatī gave birth to war-god Skanda, who, when hegrew to manhood, destroyed demon Taraka.In South India rather similar story is told of marriage of Siva andMinaksi, daughter of Pandyan king of Madurai, and event iscommemorated by one of most famous and splendid of South Indiantemples.The Relation of Visnu and SivaThe Relations of Visnu and Siva From beginning of Christian era,if not before, most educated Hindus hv been either Vaisnavites orSaivites-that is to say they hv looked on either Visnu or giva as highgod, or indeed as only God, others being merely secondaryexpressions of divine, holding rather same positions as saints andangels in mind of Roman Catholic. Thus Vaisnavite does notdeny existence of Siva, but believes that he is merely one god amongmany, creation or emanation of Visnu or of his demiurge Brahma. In thesame way Śaivite looks on Visnu as an emanation of Siva. Occasionallythis difference of viewpoint has led to friction and some degree ofpersecution, but generally two great divisions of Hinduism hv rubbedalong happily together, in conviction that, on ultimate analysis, both areequally right. Hinduism is essentially tolerant, and would rather assimilatethan rigidly exclude. So wiser Vaisnavites and Saivites recognized veryearly that gods whom they worshipped were different aspects of thesame divine being. Divine is diamond of innumerable facets; twovery large and bright facets r Visnu and Siva, while others representall gods that were ever worshipped. Some facets seem larger, brighter,and better polished than others, but in fact devotee, whatever his sect,worships whole diamond, which is in reality [Page 310] perfect. Themore devout Hindus, even when illiterate and ignorant, hv always beenfundamentally monotheist. Thus in Bhagavad Gita Krsna says:“If any worshipper do reverence with faithto any god whatever,I make his faith firm,and in that faith he reverences his god,and gains his desires,for it is I who bestow them.”61With this background of tolerance it is not surprising that attempts weremade to harmonize Vaisnavism and Śaivism. As early as Gupta times holytrinity of Hinduism, Trimūrti or triple form, was evolved, of Brahma thecreator, Visnu preserver, and Viva destroyer. doctrine of theTrimūrti was occasionally popular in some circles, and is proclaimed in thefine hymn of Kalidasa, which inspired once well-known poem ofEmerson:“Praise to you, O Trinity,one before creation,afterwards dividedin your three qualities!…“You, one causeof death and life and birth,in your three formsproclaim your own glory…“In cycle of your day and nightall things live and all things die.When you wake we live,when you sleep we perish….“Hard and soft, large and small,heavy and light, you r all things.You r both substance and form,ineffable in power….“You r knower and known,you r eater and food,you r priest and oblation,you r worshipper and prayer.” 62Early western students of Hinduism were impressed by parallelbetween Hindu trinity and that of Christianity. In fact parallel is notvery close, and Hindu trinity, unlike Holy Trinity of Christianity,never really “caught on”. All Hindu trinitarianism [Page 311] tended tofavour one god of three; thus, from context it is clear that Kālidāsa’shymn to Trimūrti is really addressed to Brahmi, here looked on as thehigh god. Trimūrti was in fact an artificial growth, and had little realinfluence.Another significant syncretism was god Harihara (Hari being title ofVisnu and Hara of Śiva), worshipped in form of an icon whichcombined characteristics of both gods. cult of Harihara developed inthe middle ages, and had some success in Deccan, where Hariharatemples were patronized by Vijayanagara kings, and where god is stillworshipped.The Mother GoddessThe Mother Goddess Mother Goddesses were worshipped at all times inIndia, but between days of Harappā Culture and Gupta periodthe cults of goddesses attracted little attention from learned andinfluential, and only emerged from obscurity to position of realimportance in Middle Ages, when feminine divinities, theoreticallyconnected with gods as their spouses, were once more worshipped bythe upper classes.The goddess was śakti, strength or potency of her malecounterpart. It was thought that god was inactive and transcendent,while his female element was active and immanent, and by Guptaperiod wives of gods, whose existence had always been recognized,but who had been shadowy figures in earlier theology, began to beworshipped in special temples. In early 5th century an inscription ofWestern India tells of certain Mayūrāksaka,“minister of king, who established, to gain merit,this most awful temple,a temple filled with demonesses,…sacred to Mothers, who shoutmost loudly in thick darkness,where lotuses r shakenby fierce windsaroused by magic spells.”63From this time onwards Mother Goddess increased in importance,until wave of devotional Vaisnavism swept Northern India early in theMuslim period, and stopped progress of her cult, which is still strong inBengal and Assam, and is known in other parts of India.The chief form of Mother Goddess was that of wife of Siva,called, in her benevolent aspect, Pārvatī (“Daughter of Mountain”),Mahidevi (“the Great Goddess”), Sati (“the Virtuous”), [Page 312] Gaurī (”the White One”), Annapūrnā (” Bestower of Much Food”), or simply “theMother” ( Mātā, Tamil Ammai). In her grim aspect she was known as Durg(” Inaccessible”), Kali (“the Black One”), and Candī (“the Fierce”). Theterrible Tamil war-goddess Korravai, who danced among slain on thebattlefield and ate their flesh, though independent in origin, was earlyidentified with her. In her fierce aspect she is often depicted as horriblehag (pl. LXX), frequently with many arms bearing different weapons, withfierce carnivorous tusks, red tongue lolling from her mouth, and garlandof skulls. Her mount is lion, and she is sometimes shown as sternlybeautiful woman, slaying buffalo-headed demon in manner of St.George and dragon (pl. XLIIb). more gentle aspect of goddessis that of beautiful young woman, often portrayed with her lord Siva. Aninteresting iconographical development is that of Ardhandrisvara, afigure half Śiva and half Pārvatī, representing union of god with hissakti. As Śiva is worshipped in linga or phallic emblem, so Durgā isworshipped in female emblem, or yoni. acc to legend Pārvatī, inthe incarnation before that in which she became bride of Siva, had beenborn as Sati, daughter of sage Daksa, and had then also become thewife of great god. When her father quarrelled with her divine lord sheflung herself into flames of his sacrificial fire, and ashes of her yonifell in various spots in India, which became pīthas, or sacred shrines ofher cult.Lesser GodsAs well as Visnu, Śiva and Durgā, many other gods were worshipped.Unlike gods of Veda, new gods of Hinduism were no longerclosely tied to natural phenomena, but were thought of moreanthropomorphically.Brahmā, Prajāpati of later Vedic times, had history of slow decline.In early Buddhist scriptures he and Indra were greatest of gods,and in Mahābhārata he was still very important; but though depicted inmedieval sculpture, sometimes with four faces, he was little worshippedafter Gupta times. single temple of Brahmā, by sacred lake Puskaranear modern Ajmer, is only one known.The numerous solar deities of Vedas were merged in Hinduism into asingle god, usually known as Sūrya (” Sun”) (pl. XXXVII a). In Guptaand medieval times there existed numerous temples of sun, especially inWestern India, which was open to Zoroastrian influence, and some of hisworshippers seem to hv looked on him as greatest god of all.Messrs Faber & Faber, Royal Academy Trustees and Birmingham Museum and Art GalleryColossal Bronze Buddha.

He had no independent cult, but was worshipped as one ofthe nine planets (p. 491). cult of planets was popularized by thegrowth of astrology in medieval times, and representations of dm arefairly numerous.Indra, Vedic war-god, lost much of his prestige but gained newattributes. Mounted on his elephant Airavata, he was guardian of easternquarter of universe, and ruler of one of lower heavens, Amaravati.Under an alternative name, Sakra, perhaps originally different god, he wasamong chief divinities of early Buddhism, second only to Brahmā. Bythe Middle Ages he had few temples or worshippers.Varuna, all-seeing god of Vedas (p. 236ff), descended from hisheavenly palace to become god of waters, but he remained theguardian of western quarter of universe. cult of Varunadisappeared early, though Tamil fishermen long worshipped marine deity,called Varunaṉ, in emblem of “shark’s horn”. This god, however, isclearly an indigenous Tamil divinity who had acquired an Āryan name.Yama, guardian of southern quarter, death-god of Vedas, wasstill remembered, though rarely if ever specially worshipped. His role hadsomewhat altered, for he was no longer cheerful lord of paradise, but astern judge of dead, ruling only over purgatories where wickedsuffered until their rebirth. idea of divine judge, theoreticallyunnecessary acc to doctrine of karma, may hv been importedfrom West, where it was known in many cults. Sometimes Yama, aidedby his clerk Citragupta, is described as weighing deeds of souls ofthe dead in balance, rather like Egyptian Thoth.The northern quarter was ruled by god Kubera, lord of precious [Page314] metals, minerals, jewels, and wealth generally. This god, under thealternative name Vaiśravana, first appears briefly and faintly in later Vedicliterature, and is well known in Buddhism and Jainism. He dwells in thebeautiful jewelled city of Alaka, near Mount Kailasa, and commands hostsof gnomes ( guhyaka) and fairies ( yaksa). He is usually depicted as adwarfish figure with large paunch. He was object of cult, though notof an important one.These four gods, Yama, Indra, Varuna and Kubera, were known asLokapālas, or Guardians of Universe. In late texts four further guardiansof intermediate quarters were added— Soma in North-East, Vayu (thewind-god) in North-West, Agni in South-East, and Sūrya in theSouth-West. Of these Agni, firegod, was still important at time ofthe Epics, but he too lost much of his hold on imagination in later times,while Vayu, windgod, was vague and tenuous deity, except in lateschool of Madhva (p. 333).The war-god Skanda, also called Kumāra (“The Prince”), Kārtikeya and,in South, Subrahmanya, was probably originally non-Āryan divinity.He was son of Śiva and Pārvatī and his sole function, acc toorthodox tradition, was to slay demon Taraka, which scarcely accountsfor his great popularity. From beginning of Christian era cult ofSkanda was widespread in North India, though it declined somewhat inmedieval times. In South it was even more important, for name andattributes of god were imposed on chief deity of ancient Tamils,Murugan, by which name Skanda is still sometimes known in Tamilcountry. Murugan in his original form was mountain god, worshipped inbacchanalian dances, at which he was impersonated by medicine-manholding spear ( velaṉ), whom dancers identified with god. Hearoused passion and erotic frenzy in girls and women, and dances ofMurugan were evidently orgiastic. Tamil Murugan was armed with aspear, and joined his fierce mother Korravai in her cannibal feasts on thebattlefield; hence his identification with Āryan Skanda is not surprising,though Murugan’s original character as fertility god is evident even today.Skanda is usually depicted as handsome young man, often with six faces,mounted on peacock.Ganesa or Ganapati (pl. LXIVc), “Chief of Gaṇas” (a class ofdemigod attendant on Śiva), is second son of Śiva and Pārvatī, and isone of best known Indian divinities in West. He has an elephant’shead with one broken tusk and fat paunch, and he rides on rat. Amongthe latest of gods of Hindu pantheon, he is not attested before 5thcentury A.D., and was of little importance before Middle Ages. Evidentlyhe is survival of primitive non-Aryan [Page 315] elephant god, but inHinduism he has become mild and cultured. He is “Lord of Obstacles”( Vighnesvara), and is worshipped at beginning of all undertakings toremove snags and hindrances. He is particularly interested in literary andeducational activities, and is patron of grammarians; manuscripts andprinted books often begin with auspicious formula Sri-Ganesayanamah, “Reverence to Lord Ganesa”. cheerful and benevolentelephant-god was, and still is, revered by nearly every Hindu, whetherVaisnavite or Saivite. small medieval sect looked on him as their chiefgod, but his status has generally been comparatively humble, thoughimportant.Hanumant, monkey god, son of Vayu and friend and servantof Rāma, was no doubt popular deity long before his incorporation in thepantheon. He is still an important village god, worshipped in many shrinesin form of monkey with more or less human body. He is beneficentguardian spirit, and in his honour monkeys r generally looked on assacred.Kama (“Desire”), known by many other names and epithets, was theIndian love-god. Like his European counterpart he is depicted as ahandsome youth, armed with bow and arrow, but Indian Eros has abow of sugar-cane strung with row of bees, and his arrows r flowers, Heis attended by troop of nymphs ( apsarases), one of whom carries hisstandard, which bears sea-monster. Kama is referred to in “Hymn ofCreation”(p. 248) and in certain other Vedic passages as being firstbornof primeval chaos, but this kama is certainly not Hindu love-god, butvaguely personified cosmic desire. On strength of these early referencesit was generally believed by theologians of Hinduism that Kama had noparents, but emerged spontaneously at beginning of time to act as acatalyst in universal process. His flowery arrows affect gods and menalike, and hv only once been known to fail in their purpose-when Kamaattempted to rouse passion of great god Śiva, and was burnt to ashesfor his pains (p. 309), to be restored to life through entreaties of hisfavourite wife, goddess Rati (“Pleasure”). He is frequently referred to inliterature and was evidently popular deity among young people of bothsexes, honoured at great annual festival (p. 207). Buddhist Mara (“theSmiter”), was sometimes identified with Kama but had sinister attributes,and was sort of Satan, personification of world, flesh and thedevil. His temptation of Buddha is one of most famous episodes ofBuddhist legend.All gods hv complementary goddesses, their wives, but most ofthese r pale reflexions of their lords, bearing same names withfeminine terminations (e.g. Indrāṇ ī, Brahmāṇ ī, etc.). They [Page 316] wereoften worshipped in group, usually of seven, to which gods Kartikeyaand Ganesa were sometimes added, and portrayals of these goddesses(Mātrkā, Ambikā, “the Little Mothers”) r fairly common in medievalsculpture (pl. LXIVc). As well as Durga, who must rank as one of threechief deities of Hinduism, other goddesses were important, however.Laksmi (“Fortune “), wife of Visnu, also often called Sri, was thegoddess of good luck and temporal blessing. In some legends she is said tobe coexistent with Viṣṇu, but acc to others she appeared in her fullbeauty, like Aphrodite, at churning of primeval ocean (p. 302). Sheis usually portrayed as woman of mature beauty, seated on lotus andoften with lotus in her hand, attended by two elephants, who sprinklewater on her from their trunks. Though never an object of special cult, hericons r numerous, and she was much worshipped as subsidiary deity.She was believed to incarnate herself as wife of incarnation ofViṣṇu, and thus she was worshipped as Sītā, spouse of Rāma, asRukmiṇī, chief queen of Krsna, or as Radha, favourite of his youth.Sarasvatī (pl. Lb), wife of Brahmā, had an autonomous role as thepatron of art, music and letters. In Ṛ g Veda she was sacred river, but inlater Vedic literature was identified with hypostatic goddess of temporaryimportance, Vac (” Speech “). She was depicted as beautiful fair youngwoman, often with vīṇā, or Indian lute, and book in her hand, andattended by swan.24 Traditionally she was inventor of Sanskritlanguage and Devanagari script. Sarasvati has always been worshippedby students, writers and musicians, and her cult is still maintained.Demigods and SpiritsAs well as these greater gods there were an infinite number of lesserones. Every village had its local god or goddess ( gramade-vatā), often arude image or fetish, set up under sacred tree. Some of these villagefertility deities, through process of assimilation, attained widespreadpopularity. Local goddesses were often vaguely identified with Durga, butwere never thoroughly incorporated into mythological scheme, orprovided with husbands, and they maintained an autonomous existence onthe fringes of orthodox pantheon. Chief of such goddesses was Śītalā(“the Cool”), called in Tamil country Mariyammai (“Mother Death”),the goddess of smallpox, worshipped for prevention and cure, especially bymothers on behalf of their children. Similarly snake-goddess Manasa[Page 317] (pl. XLV b) protected from snakebite. male deity of this type,widely popular in Tamil countryside from ancient days, was Aiyanar, abeneficent guardian deity much revered by peasants, and sometimesthought of as son of Siva. cities of ancient India, like those of theclassical world, had their guardian deities, who might be importantmembers of pantheon, but were often of only local significance. Besidesthese local gods world was full of demigods and spirits, good and evil.The snake-spirits ( Nāga) (pl. XLIb), half-human, but with serpent’s tail,were very ancient objects of worship. They dwelt in beautifulunderground city of Bhogavati, and guarded great treasures, some of whichthey occasionally bestowed on mortals whom they favoured. They couldtake wholly human form, and more than one dynasty of ancient Indiaclaimed descent from union of human hero and nāginī. Probably theprototypes of nagas were dark primitive tribes, met by Aryans intheir expansion over India, for primitive people called Nagas exists inAssam to this day; but cult of serpents is so widespread in India that thenagas must certainly owe much to aboriginal snake cults.The Yakṣ as, especially associated with god Kubera, were sort ofgnome or fairy, worshipped by country people. Before Christian eratheir cult was widespread, but.they lost their significance as great godsof Hinduism became more widely worshipped. They were generally lookedon as friendly to men, but their womenfolk might sometimes be malevolent,and ate little children.The Gandharvas survived from Vedic times as servants of Indra andheavenly musicians. Associated with them, and sometimes thought of as asubdivision of their order, were Kinnaras, also heavenly musicians, whohad human heads and horses’ bodies, and thus resembled classicalcentaurs, with whom they may be connected.The Gandharvas were all male. Their female counterparts were theApsarases, in Vedic times connected with water, but later translated toheaven. They were beautiful and libidinous, and specially delighted intempting ascetics in their meditations. Thus Menaka apsaras seduced thegreat sage Visvamitra, and conceived Sakuntala, heroine of Kālidasā’sfamous drama (p. 435ff). Another apsaras famous in story was Urvaśī, theheroine of another drama of Kalidasa, story of whose love for mortalking Puriiravas (p.405 ff) is as old as Ṛ g Veda. Sometimes apsarasesappear in role of valkyries, raising slain heroes from battlefield andbearing dm to heaven to be their lovers.A further group of demigods was that of Vidyādharas or [Page 318]heavenly magicians, mysterious beings who lived in magic cities in highHimalayas. Like Vedic munis (p. 243) they could fly through air andtransform themselves at will, and they were generally favourable to men.The Rsis (” sages “or more literally “seers “), were composers of theVedic hymns, and other legendary wise men of olden times, who had beentranslated to heaven, where they enjoyed status comparable to that of thegods. Chief of these were “Seven Rsis”, identified with stars of theGreat Bear-Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha.Other important rsis were Kaśyapa and Daksa, said in some stories to havebeen progenitors of gods and men; Narada, who invented vīnā andwas sort of patron saint of music; Visvamitra, ksatriya who by his pietyand asceticism raised himself to brāhman status, and who is heard of inmany legends; Brhaspati, preceptor of gods and demons, who began hiscareer in Vedic times as god, but whose status fell to that of ṛṣi, whowas also identified with planet Jupiter (pl. LIIIb), and who is said tohave founded materialist system of philosophy and science ofstatecraft; and Agastya, who taught Southerners religion and culture.Somewhat less exalted than rsis were Siddhas, large class of saintswho had won place for themselves in heaven by their piety.Chief among evil spirits were Asuras, or demons. word asurawas in Vedic times applied to certain gods (p. 236), but in Hinduism it isused for group of heavenly spirits who r continually at war with thegods, whose power they sometimes shake, but never conquer. Moreimmediately dangerous to men were various classes of goblin, such asthe Raksasas, most famous of whom was Rāvaṇa ten-headed demonking of Laṇkā (Ceylon), whom Rama defeated and killed. Few raksasas hadthe same power as Rāvaṇa, but all were frightful and dangerous, takingterrible forms and lurking in dark places at night, to kill and eat men andotherwise distress them. Somewhat less terrible were Piśācas, who, likethe nagas, may hv had material basis in wild tribe, since very basedialect of Prākrit was attributed to them. Both these classes of demonhaunted battlefields, charnel grounds, and places of violent death, as did aspecial class of demon, Vetala, or vampire, which took up its abode incorpses. Finally night was haunted by ghosts ( preta, bhuta), nakedspirits of those who had died violent deaths, and for whom sraddha had notbeen performed. These miserable beings were very dangerous to men,particularly to their own surviving relatives.

Hindu worship was not confined to propitiation of gods and [Page319] demigods, for whole of nature was in some sense divine. Great andholy men were reverenced, both during their lives and for long after theirdeaths, for they contained portion of godhead. Thus sixty-threeNāyaṉars of Tamil Śaivism and twelve Alvars of Tamil Vaisnavism stillenjoy status of demigods, as do other great religious teachers amongtheir followers.

Not only men, but animals and plants were and still r holy, notably, ofcourse, cow. acc to one legend cow Surabhi, mother of allcows, was one of treasures churned from cosmic ocean. “fiveproducts of cow” ( pancagavya)—milk, curd, butter, urine and dung-were all of great purifying potency, especially when combined in singlemixture. Despite her sanctity, there was no cow-goddess, and Surabhi andthe various “wishingcows” of legend, by milking which all desires werefulfilled, had no temples in their honour. living beast was revered, notas representative of any deity, but in her own right. bull, on otherhand, received honour largely as mount of Siva; image of Nandi isfound in most Śaivite temples and honoured with occasional offerings.

After cow snake was perhaps most revered animal of ancient India. Legendary serpents, such as Śesa (p. 300) and Vasuki (p. 302), gave snake prestige, but cult no doubt sprang from very primitive levels,since deadly snake is revered all over world by uncivilized peoplesas an emblem of both death and fertility. An offering to snakes, made at thebeginning of rainy season, was part of regular domestic ritual ofHinduism. Anthills were respected as home of snakes. Other animals,though associated with various divinities, played little part in Hindu cults.

The monkey, now much revered by peasants and simple folk in many parts of India, is not referred to as specially sacred in early Hindu texts.

Tree cults, common world over among ancient peoples, were widespread in India, where each village had its sacred tree or grove. Specially sacred were pippala or aśvattha (pīpal, Ficus religiosa), thesanctity of which spread to Buddhism, and vaṭa or nyagrodha, thebanyan (Ficus indica), secondary roots of which, reaching down from itsbranches, formed basis of much religious symbolism. Many other treeswere more or less sacred, notably aśoka (p. 202), to which womenprayed for children. There were also sacred plants, such as tulasī, typeof basil, which was sacred to Visnu, and which is still grown in thecourtyard of many Hindu homes and tended with great care. Two types ofgrass, kuśa and darbha, were also sacred from Vedic times onwards. TheVedic soma plant, however, was forgotten.[Page 320] Every hill or mountain had some degree of sanctity,especially Himalayas, which were foothills of Mount Meru, thecentre of world. Around Meru, on mountains which reached to theheavens, dwelt gods. Vaikuntha, home of Visnu, was neversatisfactorily identified, but Kailasa, mountain of Śiva, was recognizedas certain peak in Central Himalayas which has long been place ofpilgrimage. Numerous other mountains and hills in many parts of Indiawere famous for their sanctity. Even rocks often had religioussignificance, especially if upright and vaguely resembling linga of Śiva.

The ammonite ( śālagrāma), fossilized shellfish, was recognized as one of symbols of Visnu.

Rivers were also sacred, especially, of course, Ganges ( Ganga),which sprang from foot of Visnu, flowed over sky in form of themilky way ( Mandākinī), and then fell to earth from matted locks ofŚiva. Ganga was often personified as goddess in her own right, like hergreat tributary Yamunā, Jamnā. Other rivers held specially sacred werethe Sarasvatī, which was believed to flow underground and join Gangesat her confluence with Jamna at Prayaga (Allahābād), Narmadā, theGodāvarī, Krsnā (modern Krstnā) and Kāviri. Certain lakes, notablyManasa in high Himalayas near Mount Kailasa, and Puskara, nearAjmer, were also sacred, and even cities were divine (p. 200, n).

### Cosmogony
Hindu cosmology was slow in evolving, and in its final form was perhaps later than cosmology of Buddhists and Jainas. acc to this system cosmos passes through cycles within cycles for all eternity. basic cycle is kalpa, “day of Brahmā”, or 4,320 million earthly years.

His night is of equal length. 360 such days and nights constitute “year of Brahmā” and his life is 100 such years long.25 largest cycle is therefore 311,040,000 million years long, after which whole universe returns to ineffable world-spirit, until another creator god is evolved.26 In each cosmic day god creates universe and again absorbs it.

During cosmic night he sleeps, and whole universe is gathered up into his body, where it remains as potentiality. Within each kalpa r fourteen manvantaras, or secondary cycles, each lasting 306,720,000 years, with long intervals between them. In these periods world is recreated, and new Manu appears, as progenitor [Page 321] of human race.

We r now in seventh manvantara of kalpa, of which Manu is known as Manu Vaivasvata.

Each manvantara contains seventy-one Mahāyugas, or æons, of which thousand form kalpa. Each Mahāyuga is in turn divided into four yugas or ages, called Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali (p. 207). Their lengths arerespectively 4,800, 3,600, 2,400, and 1,200 “years of gods”, each ofwhich equals 360 human years. Each yuga represents progressive declinein piety, morality, strength, stature, longevity and happiness. We r atpresent in Kali-yuga, which began, acc to tradition, in 3102 B.C.,believed to be year of Mahābhārata War.

The end of Kali-yuga, acc to many epic passages, is marked by confusion of classes, overthrow of established standards, cessation of all religious rites, and rule of cruel and alien kings. Soon after this theworld is destroyed by flood and fire. This view is propounded strongly intexts which date from about beginning of Christian era, when alienkings did in fact rule much of India, and established practices were shakenby heresies such as Buddhism and Jainism. An earlier tradition would placethe Mahābhārata War c. 900 B.C. (p. 39), acc to which 1,200 years of Kali-yuga, if read as human years and not as “years of gods “, would at this time be nearing their end. Evidently some pious Hindus thought that dissolution of cosmos was imminent. Perhaps it is to departure of this fear in later times that we must attribute devising of “years of gods “, which made dissolution of world comfortably distant. Most medieval texts state that cosmic dissolution occurs only after last cycle of kalpa, and that transition from one æon to next takes place rapidly and calmly; expectation of Kalkin (p. 307), who will not destroy but regenerate world, could not otherwise be harmonized with scheme of yugas. In this, its final form, Hindu system of world-cycles is clearly an imperfect synthesis of more than one independent doctrine; manvantaras, especially, do not fit tidily into scheme, and must surely be derived from source different from that of Mahāyugas.

The system of four yugas immediately brings to mind four ages of
ancient Greece-and indeed Indian yugas r sometimes named after
metals-gold, silver, copper and iron. similar doctrine of four ages existed
in ancient Persia, and three schemes may hv been borrowed from a
common source.

The act of creation was thought of in more than one manner. school
called Sāṉ khya (p. 324f) and some lesser schools postulated existence
of primeval matter ( prakrti), of which creator made use [Page 322] to
form world, but Vedanta school, certainly most influential in the
Middle Ages, maintained that everything in universe, souls and matter
alike, was produced from God’s own essence. motive of creation was
explained by Vedanta school as “sport” ( līlā) of World Soul, and


the creation of cosmos was thought of on analogy of production
of work of art from mind of an artist.

The Soul, Karma and Samsara
The doctrine of karma, elaborated in Upanisadic times and adopted by
Buddhism and Jainism, was also part and parcel of Hinduism. acc to
the Hindu definition karma (literally “work,” or “deed”) was unseen
ripening of past actions, and though not in Hinduism substantial category,
as in Jainism, it was thought of as accumulating and dispersing. Through
karma body of next life, divine, human, animal or hellish, was
acquired; and on previous karma depended man’s character, fortune and
social class, and his happiness and sorrow. Every good act brought its
result, sooner or later, in happiness, and every evil act in sorrow. Some
Hindu philosophies even thought it theoretically possible to draw up sort
of karmic balance sheet.

The belief in karma does not necessarily involve fatalism. fatalist
strain often appeared in Hindu thought, but most teachers disapproved of it.

Our present condition is inevitable, but only because of karma accruing from our past deeds. We cannot escape law of karma any more than we cn escape law of gravity or passage of time, but by judgement and forethought we cn utilize karma to our own advantage.

The process of transmigration was interpreted somewhat variously, but all schools agreed that soul does not transmigrate in state of nudity, but with sheath or series of sheaths of subtle matter; condition of sheaths depends on balance of previous good and evil karma, and new birth is determined by nature of sheaths which surround thesoul. subtle body of transmigration is deprived of sense-organs,including mind, sixth sense, and therefore soul cannot normallyremember previous births or passage from one body to another. Veryadvanced souls, however, cn sometimes recapture memories of previousexistences, and some sects evolved special technique for doing so. Soulsare liable to transmigration throughout life of god Brahmā, though atthe end of each cosmic day, or kalpa, they return to his body aspotentialities only. On death of Brahmā, at final dissolution of theuniverse at end of hundred Brahmā-years, [Page 322] they areabsorbed into World Spirit and their karma is annihilated.

Saṃsāra, continual passage from body to body, often compared to an ever-rolling wheel, is infinitely tedious, and Hinduism inherited desire for release from transmigration which was almost universal in Indian thought. Conceptions of state of release or salvation ( mukti) and means of obtaining it differed widely.

## Six Systems of Salvation
Early in Christian era, if not before, there was theoretical classification of various schools of thought looked on as orthodox, and Saddariana or “Six Doctrines” became regular feature of Hinduism.

The Six Schools were actually of differing origin and purpose, but all were brought into scheme by being treated as equally valid ways of salvation.

They were divided into three groups of two, which were thought to be related and complementary. These were: Nyāya and Vaiśeṣ ika; Sā khya and Yoga; and Mī;māmsā and Vedānta.

Nyāya (“Analysis”) was rather school of logic and epistemology than of theology. It looked back to teacher, Aksapada Gautama, Sūtras or aphorisms attributed to whom r probably no earlier than Christian era.

Logic was forced into scheme as means of salvation by contention that clear thinking and logical argument were essential means to highest bliss, and thus religious basis was given to what was essentially system of reasoning (p. 50 if).

Vaisesika (“the School of Individual Characteristics”) was complementary to Nyāya, and perhaps older, and in medieval times two merged into what was virtually single school. While Nyaya specialized inlogic, Vaisesika was rather interested in physics than theology. earliesttext of school is Sūtras of legendary founder, Ulūka Kanāda,which had numerous exponents and commentators, greatest of whomwas Prasastapada of 5th century. basic tenet of Vaisesika, held incommon with Jainism and some schools of Buddhism, was that nature isatomic. atoms r distinct from soul, of which they r theinstrument. Each element has individual characteristics ( visesas), whichdistinguish it from four other non-atomic substances ( dravyas), whichthe school recognizes-time, space, soul and mind. atoms r eternal, butin great dissolution at end of life of Brahmā they r separatedone from another, and all things r destroyed. new Brahma utilizes theold atoms to create world afresh. Vaisesika thus postulated dualism ofmatter and soul, and declared that [Page 324] salvation depends on fullyrecognizing atomic nature of universe, and its difference from thesoul. 27

Sāṅ khya (“the Count”) is perhaps oldest of six systems, beingmentioned in Bhagavad Gītā and occurring in primitive form in theUpaniṣads. Its legendary founder was ancient sage Kapila, but theearliest surviving text of system is Sāṅ khyakārikā of Iśvarakrsna,perhaps of 4th century A.D. Sāṅkhya resembles Jainism in its rigiddualism and fundamental atheism. It teaches existence of twenty-fivebasic principles ( tattva), of which first is prakrti-a term usually looselytranslated “matter”. Creation, or rather evolution, is not due to operationof divinity, but to inherent nature of prakrti. From prakrti develops (2)Intelligence ( buddhi, also called mahat “the Great One”), and hence isproduced (3) Self-consciousness ( ahankṅ ra). Prakrti has in fact evolvedinto an active divinity. Through self-consciousness emerge five subtleelements ( tanmātra), invisible matter in its most ethereal form; five are(4) “ether” ( ākāśa), (5) air, (6) light, (7) water and (8) earth. From subtleelements material elements ( mahābhāta) emerge (9–13). Working onthis material, Self-consciousness then produces five organs of sense(jnānendriya): (14) hearing, (15) touch, (16) sight, (17) taste and (18) smell,and five of action ( karmendriya): (19) speech, (20) grasping, (21)walking, (22) evacuation and (23) procreation. Each of these organscorresponds to an element, in respective order. Finally Self-consciousnessproduces twenty-fourth of basic components of world, mind( manas), looked on as sixth sense, which acts as intermediary between allthe ten organs and outside world. This remarkable and fantastic doctrineof cosmic evolution, interpreted in simple terms, implies that bodies, andindeed whole cosmos, r products of ego ( ahahnkra), conceived asbasically material.But there is another tattva, twenty-fifth. This is Purusa, literally “thePerson”, soul. As in Jainism, there is an infinite number of souls in theuniverse, all equal, eternally inactive spectators of evolution of prakṛti.Purusa is not dependent on prakrti nor prakṛti on puruṣa—a universe isconceivable completely devoid of soul and yet evolving in same way asthe universe we know, for intelligence, personality and mind r not parts ofthe soul. Yet souls in some way become involved in matter, and theirsalvation lies in realizing their difference from it.

A very important feature of Sāṅkhya metaphysics is doctrine of the
three constituent qualities ( guna), causing virtue ( sattva), passion [Page325] ( rajas) and dullness ( tamas). In its undeveloped state cosmic mattercontains these three in equilibrium, but as world evolves one or other ofthe three preponderates in different objects or beings, and proportionsaccount for values of universe. Sattva guṇ a, quality of virtue, ispresent in all things tending to truth, wisdom, beauty and goodness; thequality of passion inheres in all that is fierce, violent, energetic, forceful oractive; while dullness is found in what is dark, stupid, gloomy, wretched orunhappy. This threefold classification affected many aspects of Indian lifeand thought and its influence reached far beyond Sāṅikhya schoolwhich made it its own.

The dualism of soul and matter and fundamental atheism of Sāṅkhyawere somewhat modified in Middle Ages as concession to theprevalent monism and theism. Purusa literally means “person” or “man”,and prakrti is of feminine gender. It is not surprising that latter waspersonified as wife of former, especially by tantric sects. Theinactive purusa of earlier system became generator, and cold andrather pedantic Sāṅkhya, in much modified form, became commonproperty of popular Indian religion of later times.

Yoga, name of fourth system, is word well known in West,and is connected etymologically with English word “yoke”. It may befreely translated “spiritual discipline” or “application “. term is looselyused to imply all religious exercises and acts of self-mortification ofIndian religion, earnest follower of such practices being yogī. In thisbroad sense yoga has been part of teaching of every Indian sect, but itwas also name of distinct school, which emphasized psychic trainingas chief means of salvation. basic text of this school is YogaSūtras of Patañjali; this teacher was traditionally identified with famousgrammarian believed to hv lived in 2nd century B.C., but Sūtras intheir present form r probably several centuries later.

The metaphysical ideas of Yoga school were originally closely akin to those of Sāṅkhya, but they differed in that they brought deity into picture. God ( Iśvara) of Yoga was not creator, but specially exaltedsoul, which had existed for all eternity without ever being enmeshed inmatter. Thus god of Yoga resembled Buddha of Lesser Vehicle,or glorified Tīrthaikara of Jainism, never coming in contact with hisworshippers, but invaluable as an example. He was specially symbolized inthe sacred syllable OM, which in Yoga school was much revered, asgiving insight into sublime purity of soul and thus aiding meditation.

A Yoga [Page 326] theism soon developed, however, and God of later Yoga texts differs little from that of other schools.
The course of training of yogī was divided into eight stages, reminding us of eightfold path of Buddhism, but far less practical:
(1) Self-control ( yama), practice of five moral rules: non- violence, truthfulness, not stealing, chastity, and avoidance of greed.
(2) Observance ( niyama), regular and complete observance of above five rules.
 (3) Posture ( āsana), sitting in certain postures, difficult without practice,
which r thought to be essential to meditation. most famous of these is padmāsna, “Lotus Posture”, in which feet r placed on opposite thighs, and in which gods and sages r commonly depicted.
(4) Control of Breath ( prānāyāma), whereby breath is held and controlled and respiration forced into unusual rhythms, which r believed to be of great physical and spiritual value.
(5) Restraint ( pratyāhāra), whereby sense organs r trained to take no note of their perceptions.
(6) Steadying Mind ( dhāranā), by concentration on single object, such as tip of nose, navel, an icon, or sacred symbol.
(7) Meditation ( dhyāna), when object of concentration fills whole mind.
(8) Deep Meditation ( samādhi), when whole personality is temporarily dissolved.

Yoga was sometimes developed in special and rather dubious ways,especially by tantric schools of Middle Ages. course of trainingoutlined above was known as “Royal Yoga” ( rājayoga), but other yogasystems developed, such as “Yoga of Spells” ( mantrayoga), whichtaught continual repetition of magic syllables and phrases as means ofdissociating consciousness; “Yoga of Force” ( hathayoga), whichemphasized importance of physical means such as special acrobaticexercises and very difficult postures, and sometimes advocated sexual unionas means of salvation; and “Yoga of Dissolution”( layayoga), oftenidentified with hathayoga, based on certain ancient Indian physiologicalnotions, which play big part in form of yoga sometimes taught byWestern practitioners.The chief vein of body, known as suśumna, runs through spinalcolumn. Along it at different points r six “wheels” ( cakra), orconcentrations of psychic energy. At top of vein susumna, within theskull, is sahasrāra, specially powerful psychic centre symbolically referredto as lotus. In lowest “wheel”, behind genitals, is kundalini, the“serpent power”, generally in quiescent state. By yogic practices thekundalinl is awakened, rises [Page 327] through vein susumna, passesthrough all six “wheels” of psychic force, and unites with topmostsahasrāra. By awakening and raising his kundalini yogī gains spiritualpower, and by uniting it with sahasrāra he wins salvation.The awakened kundalini gives to yogī superhuman power andknowledge, and many yogīs hv practised yoga rather for this than forsalvation. Some adepts of this form of yoga hv developed powers whichcannot fully be accounted for by European medical science and whichcannot be explained away as subjective, but physiological basis of laya-and hatha-yoga is certainly false; there is no kundalini, susumna orsahasrāra. ancient mystical physiology of India needs further study,not only by professional Indologists, but by open-minded biologists andpsychologists, who may reveal true secret of yogī. For whatever wemay think about his spiritual claims there is no doubt that advanced yogīcan hold his breath for very long periods without suffering injury, cancontrol rhythm of his own heart-beats, cn withstand extremes of heatand cold, cn remain healthy on starvation diet, and, despite his austereand frugal life and his remarkable physical contortions, which would ruinthe system of any ordinary man, cn often survive to very advanced agewith full use of his faculties.Mimāmsa (“Enquiry”), differed in origin from other systems in that itwas not so much school of salvation as of exposition. Its original purposewas to explain Vedas, and it was virtually survival of brahmanism.The earliest work of school is Sūtras of Jaimini (perhaps of 2ndcentury B.C.), which set out to show that Vedas r eternal, self-existent,and wholly authoritative, and to defend their authenticity against all comers.This led to some development of logic, dialectics and semantics in theschool. Sabarasvamin (? 6th century) greatest of Mīmāmsā scholars, hadmuch to say on law. It was only in 7th and 8th centuries that schooldeveloped full philosophy of salvation, acc to which respect for theVedas and observance of their rules were essential first steps on road.By time of Kumarila (8th century) Mimamsa school was beginningto merge with Vedanta.Vedānta (“the End of Vedas”), also called Uttara Mīmāmsā (“later
Mīmāmsā “), is most important of six systems, and, in its many sub-
schools, it has produced characteristic features of modern intellectualHinduism. basic text of system is Brahma Sūtras ofBadarayana, written early in Christian era, which hv been commentedon by many scholars of all ages, down to present day. Vedanta is still aliving school, and modem theologians and mystical [Page 328] teacherssuch as Vivekananda and Aurobindo Ghose, and philosophers such as Sir S.

Radhakrishnan, r all Vedantists. doctrines of Vedanta were based on
the Upanisads, and gave logical and organized form to their many mysticalspeculations. classical Vedanta is that of great philosopher Śaṅkara(? 788–820), South Indian Śaivite brāhman, who in short lifetimecomposed extensive commentaries on Brahmā Sūtras and chiefUpanisads, travelled all over India preaching his doctrines, and founded anorder of Hindu monks.

Śaṅkara was an orthodox brāhman, for whom all Vedic literature was
sacred and unquestionably true. To harmonize its many paradoxes he hadrecourse to an expedient already known in Buddhism (p. 279), that of adouble standard of truth. On everyday level of truth world wasproduced by Brahmā, and went through an evolutionary process similar tothat taught by Sāṅkhya school from which Śaṅkara took over thedoctrine of three guṇas. But on highest level of truth whole

phenomenal universe, including gods themselves, was unreal-the worldwas Maya, illusion, dream, mirage, figment of imagination.Ultimately only reality was brāhman, impersonal World Soul of theUpanisads, with which individual soul was identical. As in theUpanisads, salvation was to be obtained by recognition of this identitythrough meditation. Sankara’s brāhman is not really different from the“Void” or Nirvana of Mahayana Buddhism (p. 277), fact wellrecognized by Sankara’s opponents, who called him crypto-Buddhist.Śaṅkara’s greatness lies in his brilliant dialectic. By able use of logicalargument, and, we must admit, by interpreting some phrases veryfiguratively, he reduced all apparently self-contradictory passages of theUpanisads to consistent system which, though not unchallenged, hasremained standard philosophy of intellectual Hinduism to this day. Thecomparison of Śaṅkara in Hinduism with St. Thomas Aquinas in theRoman Catholic Church is very fair one.The doctrine of Śaṅkara is often known as advaita (“allowing nosecond”, i.e. monism) or kevalādvaita (strict monism).

## Theism and Devotion
The sect of Bhāgavatas, worshippers of Vasudeva, identified withKrsna and Visnu, was active at least century before Christ. little laterarose sect of Pasupatas, devotees of Pasupati, or Śiva. We know littleabout early history of these sects, but it is certain that they were theistic,and stressed merits of worship rather than of sacrifice. In MiddleAges their doctrines were given philosophy.

A widespread Vaisnavite school, known as Pāñcarātra (“Five [Page
329] Nights”, of uncertain significance), gave cosmological basis to themyths of Vasudeva-Krsna, by identifying him and his family with cosmicemanations, and thus building system of evolution similar to those of themore orthodox six systems, of which we hv described Sāṅkhyan as atypical example. From Vasudeva, identified with Visnu, ultimatepersonal godhead, developed Sankarsana (another name of Kṛsna’s brotherBalarama) at beginning of time; this emanation was identified withprakrti, or primal matter. two produced Pradyumna (Krsna’s son)identified with manas or mind; thence arose Aniruddha (Kṛsna’s grandson)who was self-consciousness ( ahaṅ kāra). Only then did three gunasevolve, and with dm Brahmā demiurge.

In Pāñcarātra system Safikarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha r notmerely aspects of divine character, but gods in their own right, as theywere with early Bhagavatas. gods r thus simultaneously one andmany. There is no question here of different levels of truth, as in Śaṅkara’ssystem, but of an eternal paradox. soul is one with God, but at sametime it is an individual. Even in state of full salvation it retains enoughindividuality to realize bliss of union with godhead. Pāñcarātradoctrine of emanations ( vyśha) may hv developed in Kashmir, where it isbelieved that earliest texts of school were written; but it found acomplementary development in Tamil country, where great growth ofdevotional religion was taking place at same time.

The devotion ( bhakti) of early Bhāgavatas, as exemplified in Bhagavad Gītā, had been somewhat restrained in its expression. By lessspiritually developed worshipper god was probably not realized as anever-present and indwelling spirit, but as mighty and rather distant king,to be adored from afar. This is spirit of Gupta hymn to Sunquoted above (p. 313) and even in general of Bhagavad Gītā itself.

When Kṛsna reveals himself as supreme god and shows his transcendent form, Arjuna falls to ground in terror, unable to bear theawful splendour of theophany. god admittedly states that he is inthe heart of all beings, that he raises his worshippers from sea oftransmigration, and that they r very dear to him; but he is still rather GodTranscendent than God Immanent. Arjuna compares Kṛsna’s relation to himto that of friend and friend, father and son, lover and beloved; but his chieffeeling at revelation of Kṛsna’s divinity is one of awe:“You r father of universe, of all that moves and all that moves not,its worshipful and worthy teacher.

You hv no equal-what in three worlds could equal you, O power
beyond compare?

[Page 330] “So, reverently prostrating my body,
I crave your grace, O blessed lord.

As father to son, as friend to friend, as lover to beloved,
bear with me, God.

“I rejoice that I hv seen what none has seen before,
but my mind trembles with fear.

Graciously show me again your earthly form,
Lord of Gods, Home of World.” 65
Thus early bhakti was inspired by feelings rather of respect than of
love. Divine grace was condescension of mighty potentate, ster and
functional. His glory was glory of an emperor, which ordinary
mortal could hardly contemplate.

Buddhism may hv influenced new form of piety which appeared in medieval times, for concept of Bodhisattva, looking down in love and pity and helping all creation, was probably earlier than any comparableidea in Hinduism. But new form of devotion seems to hv developedfirst in Tamil country. One of its earliest expressions is remarkablepoem of collection called “Ten Odes “, almost certainly earlier thanthe 7th century. This is “Guide to Lord Murugan “, description ofthe chief shrines of old Tamil god, which worshipper is advised tovisit in turn. Throughout most of poem god retains his wild andprimitive character, with attributes of northern Skanda added (p.314); but at last worshipper meets him face to face.

“When you see his face, praise him with joy,
worship him with joined palms, bow before him,
so that his feet touch your head….

“Holy and mighty will be his form,
rising to heaven, but his sterner face
will be hidden, and he will show you
the form of young man, fragrant and beautiful;
and his words will be loving and gracious—
‘Don’t be afraid—I knew you were coming!’”66
Here surely we find new conception of godhead struggling to express
itself, idea of god who feels an intense love for men, and to whom the
worshipper cn return same love. This found its first full expression in
the hymns of early Tamil devotees ( Nāyanārs and Ālvārs), which are
among India’s greatest contributions to world’s religious literature.

The devotion of Tamil hymnodists is no longer reverence for atranscendent deity, but ecstatic love for an immanent one. love [Page331] of God, moreover, is reflected by worshipper in love for hisfellows. In Tamil word aṉ bu we hv something more closelyapproaching Christian virtue of love than any Sanskrit term. Moreoverthe Tamil devotees often worshipped their God with deep sense of sin andinadequacy, which is rarely to be found in contemporary Āryan religiousliterature, and recalls Vedic hymns to Varuna.

“You r father, you r mother,
you r elder brother,
you r all kinsmen,
you r fair women, and abundant riches.

You r family, friends and home,
fount of pure wisdom, of wisdom to press onward.

You r gold, you r jewel, you r pearl—
You r lord, Rider on Bull,28 you r bliss.” 67
“‘O most desired, O king, O lord, eternal form,
my fortune, supreme mystic!’ Thus I sang each day.

My gold! My hill of coral! in love of you …
I hv journeyed far to see bright flower of your feet.”68
“A sinner, I hv left way of love and service.

Too well I hv known meaning of sickness and pain.

I will go now and worship.

How foolish I hv been! How long cn I be parted
from my pearl, my mighty jewel, my diamond, Lord of the
shrine of Ārūr?”69
“He whom King of Gods knows but in part, God of
Gods,
The triple Lord, who makes, preserves and ends
the lovely universe, Primal Form,
the Ancient of Days, Lord of Pārvatī,…
came in his grace and took me for his own,
so now I bow to none, and revere him alone.

I am among servants of his servants,
and I shall bathe in joy, and dance and sing.” 70
“Into my vile body of
flesh you came, as though it were temple of gold,
and soothed me wholly and saved me,
O Lord of Grace, O Gem Most Pure.

Sorrow and birth and death and illusion
you took from me, and set me free.

O Bliss! O Light! I hv taken refuge in you,
and never cn I be parted from you.” 71

[Page 332] This impassioned devotionalism gradually affected whole religious outlook of Tamil country. great Śaṅkara himself, though he maintained rigid Upanisadic doctrine of salvation by knowledge, wasthe reputed author of some fine devotional poems in Sanskrit. It was only tobe expected that new forms of worship should receive formal shape, andbe harmonized with Upanisads. This was done in different forms by aseries of Dravidian theologians who succeeded Śaṅkara.

Chief of these was Ramanuja, brāhman who taught in great templeof Śrīrangam. He is said to hv lived from 1017 to 1137, but first dateis in all probability several decades too early. Like Śaṅkara he taught inmany parts of India, and claimed to base his doctrines on earlier sources,writing lengthy commentaries on Brahma Sūtras, Bhagavad Gītāand Upanisads. Ramanuja’s system was founded on that of thePāñcarātras, but his emphasis was rather different. He admitted theusefulness of ritual observances, but only in qualified measure, and he alsoadmitted Śaṅkara’s doctrine of salvation by knowledge, but declared thatthose so saved would find state of bliss inferior to highest. bestmeans of salvation was devotion, and best yoga was bhakti-yoga, suchintense devotion to Visnu that worshipper realized that he was but afragment of God, and wholly dependent on him. Another means ofsalvation was prapatti, abandonment of self, putting one’s soulcompletely in hands of God, trusting in his will, and waiting confidentlyfor his grace.

Ramanuja’s God was personal being, full of grace and love for hiscreation. He could even override power of karma to draw repentantsinners to him. Unlike impersonal World Soul of gankara, which madethe illusory universe in sort of sport ( lila), Ramanuja’s God needed man,as man needed God. By forcing sense Ramanuja interpreted wordsof Kṛsna, “the wise man I deem my very self” 72 to imply that just as mancannot live without God, so God cannot live without man. individualsoul, made by God out of his own essence, returned to its maker and livedforever in full communion with him, but was always distinct. It shared thedivine nature of omniscience and bliss, and evil could not touch it, but itwas always conscious of itself as an I, for it was eternal by virtue of itsbeing part of godhead, and if it lost self-consciousness it would cease toexist. It was one with God, but yet separate, and for this reason systemof Rāmānuja was called visistādvaita, or “qualified monism”. Ramanujawas not as brilliant metaphysician as Śaṅkara, but Indian religion perhapsowes even more to him than to his predecessor. In centuriesimmediately following his death [Page 333] his ideas spread all over India,and were starting-point of most of devotional sects of later times.

Many later theologians developed Ramanuja’s teaching, and in Tamilcountry two main doctrinal divisions arose, analogous to Arminians andCalvinists of early Protestantism. Northern School taught that salvationcould only be obtained “on analogy of monkey”; God saved souls asthe monkey carries her young to safety, clinging to her body-some effort onthe part of believer was needed. Southern School taught salvation“on analogy of cat”; just as cat picks up her kittens in her teeth, soGod saves whom he wills, with no effort on their part.

A teacher who developed Ramanuja’s doctrines in surprising directions was Madhva, who taught in 13th century. This Canarese theologian broke completely with Upanisadic doctrine of unity of God and human soul, and taught dualism ( dvaita). He explained away as figurative all passages of scripture which maintained monism, and declared thatVisnu, individual souls and matter were eternally and completely distinct.Visnu has full power over both souls and matter, and saves formerentirely by his grace, which is only granted to those who live pure andmoral lives. Evil souls r predestined to eternal damnation, which isconceived as infinite remoteness from God-while souls of mediocre qualitywill transmigrate eternally.

An interesting feature of Madhva’s theology is important part playedby wind-god Vayu, son of Visnu, who is his agent in world, andhas some of features of Holy Ghost of Christian theology.29 Theresemblances of Madhva’s system to Christianity r so striking thatinfluence, perhaps through Syrian Christians of Malabar, is almostcertain. sharp distinction between God and soul, doctrine ofeternal damnation, and status of Vayu r obvious points of similarity.

In legends about Madhva there r stories of miracles which must surelyhave been borrowed from Gospels: as boy he successfully disputedwith learned brahmans in temple; when he undertook asceticism voicefrom heaven proclaimed his greatness; he fed multitudes with handfuls offood; he walked on water; and he stilled raging ocean with glance.

Saivism too developed theology adapted to devotional literature ofthe hymnodists. early literature of Pāūupatas and other Saivitesects, called Agamas and written in Sanskrit, was supplemented, and thenvirtually superseded, by texts in Tamil repeating much of oldertheology, but incorporating devotional faith of Nāyanārs. series offourteen such texts, all written by 14th [Page 334] century, forms thebible of Śaivasiddhānta, and is among most influential religiousliterature of South India.

Tamil Saivism teaches reality of three categories, God ( Pati, “Lord”), souls ( pasu, literally “animals”) and matter ( pasa, “bond”). Insalvation soul is united, but not identified, with deity. Tamil Śaivismthus goes further in direction of dualism than qualified monism ofthe Vaisnavite Ramanuja. Its most striking feature is disappearance ofall harsh, capricious and amoral attributes of old Siva. In hischaracter as bestower of karma he is pure justice, and his justice is but anaspect of his love for his creatures. He is ready at their call, and manifestshimself to dm in whatever form they worship him.

“His form is love, his qualities, his knowledge r love,
his deeds r love, his hands and feet r love, all his attributes
are love.

Unfathomable godhead assumes all these for welfare of all
things living.”73
“In his love Lord punishes
that sinner may mend his ways
and follow right.

All his acts flow from his love.

“Goodness, love, grace and gentleness,
courtesy, friendship and modesty,
honesty, penance and chastity,
charity, respect, reverence and truthfulness,
purity and self-control,
wisdom and worship—
all these together r perfect virtue,
and r word of loving Lord.”74
Tamil Śaivism perhaps approached nearer to thorough-going
monotheism than any other Hindu sect.

“Whatever god you accept, he is that god.

Other gods die and r born, and suffer and sin.

They cannot reward,
but he will see and reward your worship!”75
“We worship some god-our parents for instance—
but they do not reward us, even when they seem to show us
their grace,
for all these gods r under command of Almighty,
and through dm he fulfils our prayers.

“If Śiva alone rewards us, loving him is highest virtue,
and worship of other gods is of little use.

Dharma is his will; he has no desires
except to do good-so be firm in his worship.” 76
[Page 335] In Kashmīr another school of Saivism arose, known as Trika
or Triad, from fact that sect had three chief scriptures. This school,


unlike Tamil Saivasiddhanta, was monistic, and shared Sankara’s doctrine of unreality of phenomenal world, which, it declared, only existed because soul failed to recognize its true nature. For school ofthe Trika salvation came with an act of recognition or suddenenlightenment, rather like sudden conversion of old-fashionedNonconformity. greatest name in Kashmir Saivism is that of AbhinavaGupta (10th century), brilliant theorist both in theology and poetics.

A third important Śaivite sect was that of Lingayats or Viraśaivas,founded by Basava, minister of King Bijjala Kalacuri who usurped thethrone of Calukyas of Kalyani in A.D. 1156. This sect is noteworthyrather for its cult and social doctrines than for its theology, which is a“qualified monism” with few striking features. Basava opposed imageworship; in his sect only sacred symbol is linga of Śiva, smallspecimen of which is constantly carried on person of believer.

Basava completely rejected Vedas and authority of brāhmanclass, and ordained new priesthood— jangamas. He opposedpilgrimage and sacrifice and instituted complete equality among hisfollowers, even to equality of women, who were permitted to remarryon death of their husbands. Among other Āryan practices which Basavacondemned was cremation, and his followers r still usually buried. It ispossible that he was influenced by what he had heard of Islam. TheLingāyats still retain their individuality, though they hv nowcompromised with orthodoxy in some respects, and r an important sect inparts of Hyderabad and Mysore. Their sacred literature is mainly inCanarese and Telugu.

## Hindu Rites and Ceremonies
Whereas basic rite of Vedic religion was sacrifice ( yajña), that ofHinduism is worship ( pūjā). In general god is worshipped in form ofan icon (arcā), which has been sanctified by special rites, after which it isbelieved that divinity has in some sense taken up his abode in it. Thoughdevotees often ask for boons at feet of idol, pūjā is not so much anact of prayer as of homage and entertainment. god is offered water forwashing feet, flowers and betel quids, like an honoured guest. In themorning he is ceremonially awakened with sound of music, ringingof bells, and blowing of conches. He is washed, dried and dressed. He ishonoured with flowers, garlands, incense and swinging lamps; he is fed,usually with rice and fruit, of which he eats subtle part, [Page 336]leaving gross material food for his worshippers, or to be given to thepoor. In many temples he is taken to his bedroom at night, where he joinshis wife or wives. In larger shrines he is fanned by attendants andentertained by dancing girls like any ancient Indian king. On festival dayshe tours city in splendid car, often pulled by his devotees, followed bylesser gods in their cars, musicians, bearers of yak’s-tail flywhisks ( cauri),parasols and fans, and dancers.

The temple originated as small wooden hut, enshrining rough icon orfetish, and by Gupta times India was probably as much land of temples asshe is at present. heart of temple was central shrine, home ofthe chief divinity. Usually “tank” or flight of steps leading down to ariver adjoined temple, for ritual ablution, important at all times, had bynow become an essential part of religious observance. temple mightalso contain meeting hall, where Epics, Puranas, and other non-Vedicsacred literature were recited for all who wished to listen, and rest-housefor pilgrims was also often provided, as well as many other offices andannexes, some of which served social needs of people.

Congregational worship of Christian or Islamic type was unknown inearly Hinduism, though it developed in few medieval sects. Theworshipper went to temple either alone or in family group, made hisofferings, and departed. In greater temples acts of worshipperformed by regular officiants might be watched by large number ofpeople, but they were rather an audience than congregation.

Though formal animal sacrifices of Vedic period graduallydisappeared, new type of bloody sacrifice, almost certainly adopted fromthe non-Āryan aboriginals, became popular in Middle Ages. Such ritesrarely if ever took place in Vaisnavite sects, but some Śaivites and manydevotees of Durga adopted new type of sacrifice. animals were nolonger killed with complicated ritual, but decapitated before sacred icon,in such way that some of blood fell on it. ritual slaughter ofanimals was justified by doctrine that soul of victim wentstraight to heaven, but it was not approved by best minds of times,and its survival in Bengal and elsewhere is matter of shame to mostmodern Hindus.

Favourite animals for sacrifice were buffaloes, goats, sheep and cockerels. Human sacrifice was also practised. Theoretically execution of every criminal was sort of sacrifice, and his soul was thought to be purged of guilt. victims of human sacrifice were thus often criminalsprovided by secular arm, but victims were also obtained by moredubious means. We read of girls being kidnapped to serve as humansacrifices in secret rites, and of temple of [Page 337] Durga at which adaily human sacrifice was offered. Voluntary human sacrifice, or religioussuicide’ in various forms, became quite common in Middle Ages,especially in Deccan, where numerous inscriptions commemorate themany pious souls who, in fulfilment of vows, or to ensure success oftheir king, leapt from pillars and broke their necks, cut their own throats, ordrowned themselves in sacred river. last rite of sati was, in oneaspect, human sacrifice.

Another form of religious ceremony was that practised by sects whichworshipped feminine divinities. These sects r generally known as tantric(from their scriptures, called tantras), saktic (from their worship of sakti,or personified energy of god), or “left-hand” (from fact that thegoddess sits on left of her lord). Their members believed that usualHindu rites and ceremonies, though not wholly ineffectual, were onlysuitable for ordinary worshippers of goddess; adepts, who hadundergone long rites of initiation, practised other ceremonies of muchgreater efficiency, similar to those of Buddhists of “Vehicle of theThunderbolt” (p. 280f). tantric rites involved breaking of all theusual taboos of Hinduism. Small groups of initiates met at night, often in atemple or private house, but also frequently in burning-ground, among thebones of dead. group formed circle, seated around thecircumference of large circular magical diagram (yantra, maṇḍdala)drawn on ground. Though members of circle might includebrāhmaṇs and outcastes, there was no class distinction at ceremony-allwere equal, and no ritual pollution occurred from their contact. Afterregular evening worship, propitiation of ghosts, and other rites, thegroup would indulge in five Ms ( panca-makara): madya (alcoholicdrink), māmsa (meat), matsya (fish), mudrā (symbolical hand gestures,known in other branches of Indian religion, and in dance and drama, p.

385), and maithuna (sexual intercourse). rites concluded with the


worship of five elements, to which five Ms mysteriouslycorresponded. Among some tantric groups last of five Ms involvedpromiscuous copulation, while members of others brought their wives tothe circle. With yet other groups those rites which were reprehensible toorthodoxy were performed only symbolically.The remarkable “black mass” of tantric sects, whether in Buddhismor Hinduism, became very popular in Eastern India in late medievalperiod. It is still sometimes practised, but quite without publicity, and it isprobable that with growth of puritanism and rationalism, number oftantric groups in India is now very small indeed.

## Hindu Ethics
At bottom of most Hindu writing on ethics and morality lay concept of three ends of life (p. 170), and full recognition that individuals of different classes and ages had different duties and standardsof conduct. ascetic should set his whole mind on unworldly things, butthe layman was encouraged to blend claims of religion, profession andmaterial pleasure into harmonious whole. This aspect of Hindu moralitywe hv touched on already in other contexts and need not discuss further.

To uninitiated Westerner usual moral attitude of Hinduism,especially before great changes of modern times, must seem strangemixture of reason and taboo. following passage, taken from theMānasollāsa, text on duties and amusements of kings attributed to the12th-century Deccan king Somesvara III Calukya, illustrates perfectly thisaspect of Hindu morals.

“A king should avoid (1) untruth and (2) treachery, (3) illicit
inter
course with women, and (4) eating what is forbidden.

“He should shun (5) envy and (6) contact with outcastes, he
should (7)
revere all gods, and satisfy (8) cows and (9) brahmans,
“(10) reverence his ancestors, and (11) feed his guests, (12)
obey his
preceptors, (13) practise penance, and (14) bathe in sacred
waters.

“He should (15) nourish poor, and (16) orphan and
widow,
(17) afflicted, and (18) his kin, and (19) his servants,
“and (20) protect those who come to him for refuge.

These r twenty conditions of successful reign.” 77 This passage shows that great emphasis was placed on such virtues ashospitality, charity and honesty, but piety, in sense of performance ofsuch religious acts as worship, pilgrimage, and feeding of cows andbrahmans, was equally if not more important. maintenance of taboos oncontact with untouchables and eating forbidden food (not only meat, butfood handled by low-caste persons or left over from previous meal) wasnot clearly distinguished from honesty and self-control. At all times,however, more intelligent teachers realized that mere outwardobservance was not as meritorious as inner goodness. Thus in lawbookof Gautama, after catalogue of forty religious rites which Āryanshould practice, we read:
“There r eight virtues of soul-compassion for all beings, patience, contentedness, purity, earnest endeavour, good thoughts, freedom from greed, and freedom from envy. Whoever performs sacred rites without possessing these eight virtues does not come to Brahmā or to his heaven; but if man has performed only one rite and has all eight good qualities he comes to Brahmā.”78
[Page 339] Many other sources give lists of virtues like this, all tending to encourage an earnest kindliness and tolerance in human relations. doctrine of non-violence, qualified though it was, had real effect on Hindu life, going far beyond mere restrictions on killing of animals. All Hindutexts teach mercy, compassion and friendliness, but positive benevolence,except in form of almsgiving, is less prominent, though often amonglists of virtues we find “desire for welfare of all beings”. positiveethic of love and forgiveness is feature of much Tamil sacred literature.

We quote from maxims of early Tirukkural:
“Men without love think only of self,
but loving strip themselves to bone for others.”
“For kindness done without expecting reward
heaven and earth r hardly sufficient recompense.”
“The joy of avenger lasts but day.

The joy of peacemaker lasts forever.”
“They r great who fast and do penance,
but they who forgive wrongs r even greater.”
“This, they say, is highest wisdom—
to return no harm to dm that harm you.” 79
This exalted ethical tone is to be found in much Tamil literature,
notably in Nāladiyār, collection of moral verses of somewhat
later date than Tirukkural, and in devotional hymns which we
have quoted elsewhere. But it is not only in Tamil literature that we
find call to love and kindness.

“Visnu is most pleased with him who does good to others,
who never utters abuse, calumny or untruth,
who never covets another’s wife or wealth,
and who bears ill will to none,
who neither beats nor slays any living thing,
who is ever diligent in service of gods
and of brāhmans and his teachers,
who always desires welfare of all creatures,
as of his children and of his own soul.”80
If general ethical outlook of Hinduism favoured tolerance and kindliness, it was not equalitarian, and recognized needs of society divided into many sections and classes with varied functions. man’s relations with his social inferiors should naturally differ from his relations with his betters. His standards of conduct differed [Page 340] acc to his own social class. virtues of brāhman, such as recitation of Veda, were sin to śūdra, while śūdra might legitimately do things, such as drinking spirits, which were forbidden to brāhman.Similarly child, student, householder and ascetic, had theirown codes and standards. Certain broad principles applied to all sections ofthe community, but beyond these no detailed code of morality wasuniversally binding. Each group had its own rules of conduct, varyingwidely.

It is with this background in view that we must read most famous ethical text of ancient India, Bhagavad Gītā. Though this work containsmuch theology, its kernel is ethical, and its teaching is set in frameworkof an ethical problem. hero Arjuna awaits in his chariot beginningof battle. In ranks of enemy r his old friends, relatives andteachers, men whom he has known and loved all his life. Though convincedof justice of his cause his spirits begin to sink, and he feels that hecannot fight against those who r so dear to him. He turns to Kṛsna, who isacting as his charioteer, and asks his advice. Kṛsna first explains that thedeath of body does not involve death of soul and iscomparatively unimportant:
“He who thinks this [soul] is slayer
and he who thinks this is slain
do not understand.

It neither slays nor is it slain.

“It is never born and never dies,
nor, once it exists, does it cease to be.

Unborn, eternal, abiding and ancient,
it is not slain when body is slain…
“As man puts off his worn out clothes
and puts on other new ones,
so embodied puts off worn out bodies
and goes to others that r new.

“Weapons do not cleave it,
fire does not burn it,
waters do not wet it,
wind does not dry it.

“It cannot be cleft or burnt,
or wetted or dried.

It is everlasting, it dwells in all things,
firm, unmoving, eternal….

[Page 341] “To be born is certain death,
to dead, birth is certain.

It is not right that you should sorrow
for what cannot be avoided….

“If you do not fight this just battleyou will fail in your own lawand in your honour,and you will incur sin.” 81Then Kṛsna develops his teaching on topic of human activity. Theright course is not inactivity of meditating sage, for this attempt toput works on one side is impossible and futile. God him self is continuallyactive, and man also should act; but, as far as possible, he should actwithout attachment, without personal desires or ambition. He must fulfil hisfunction in society of which he is member, doing all things for theglory of God.

“There is nothing in three worlds which I need,
nothing I do not own,
nothing which I must get—
and yet I labour forever.

“If I did not always work unwearying …
men would follow my ways.

The worlds would perish if I did not work—
I should bring back chaos, and all beings would suffer.

“So, as unwise work with attachment,
the wise should work without attachment,
O son of Bharata,
and seek to establish order in world….

“Cast all your acts upon me,
with your mind on Highest Soul.

Have done with craving and selfhood.

Throw off your terror, and fight!…
“For there is more joy in doing one’s own duty badly
than in doing another man’s duty well.

It is joy to die in doing one’s duty,but doing another man’s duty brings dread.”82The teaching of Bhagavad Gītā is summed up on maxim “yourbusiness is with deed, and not with result”. In an organized societyeach individual has his special part to play, and in every circumstance thereare actions which r intrinsically right— from point of view of poetwho wrote Gītā they r those [Page 342] laid down by Sacred Lawof Aryans and traditions of class and clan. right course must bechosen acc to circumstances, without any considerations ofpersonal interest or sentiment. Thus man serves God, and in so far as helives up to this ideal he draws near to God.

The stern ethics of Gītā r clearly intended as defence of old established order against attacks of reformers and unbelievers. virtue of brāhman is wisdom, of warrior, valour, of vaiśya,industry, of śūdra, service; by fulfilling his class function to best ofhis ability, with devotion to God and without personal ambition, man willfind salvation, whatever his class. It may be that author of Gītāsought merely to convey this message, rather barren and uninspiring when thus condensed. But behind his teaching was fervour of great religiouspoet, which transcended narrow framework of contemporary social andreligious law. Hence inspiration of Bhagavad Gītā has been widelyfelt in India from time of Guptas to present day, and it has beencommended by Christians and Muslims, as well as by Hindus, whosemost influential scripture it is. No one has so ungrudgingly admitted hisdebt to its doctrine of tireless and unselfish service as Mahatma Gāndhī,who so strongly opposed two features of ancient Indian society whichthe Gītā itself was in part written to defend—militarism and classsystem.

## (v) NON-INDIAN RELIGIONS
If we r to believe very old tradition first Christian converts in India were made by Disciple Thomas himself, soon after Crucifixion. Indian king Gondophernes sent to Syria for skilful architect to build him new city, and envoy returned with St. Thomas, who told king of City not made with hands, and converted him and many members of his court. St. Thomas afterwards preached in other partsof India, and died martyr’s death at hands of king called in Christiantradition Misdeos, who cannot be identified. historicity ofGondophernes, however, is unquestioned (p. 60), and story in its mainoutline is not impossible, for at time contact between India and Westwas close, and an enterprising missionary could easily hv travelled fromPalestine to India. Roman Catholics believe that tomb of St. Thomas isto be found in cathedral at Mailapur, suburb of Madras, though theevidence for Saint’s martyrdom there is not sufficient to satisfy thehistorian.

Several rather unreliable references to other early missions [Page 343]exist in church tradition, but first certain evidence of Christian activityin India is found in “Christian Topography” of Cosmas Indicopleustes,an adventurous Alexandrian monk of 6th century, who left an account ofhis travels. He states that there were churches in Malabar and Ceylon, in thehands of Persian priests, and supervised by Persian bishop at Kalliana(perhaps modern Cochin). It is clear that Indian Christians hadembraced Nestorian heresy, which was then widespread in Persia. TheNestorians were active missionaries, and their intrepid monks even crossedthe wastes of Central Asia and founded successful churches in China.

Whatever truth there may be in legend of St. Thomas, it seems that these missionaries, no doubt following in wake of Persian merchants,were chiefly responsible for establishing Christian community in SouthIndia. When, at later date, Islam stamped out both Zoroastrianism andChristianity in Persia, Indian Christians turned for guidance to thepatriarch of Antioch, and has maintained contact with Syria to this day.

When European travellers again visited India they noticed Christianchurches of South. Marco Polo, at end of 13th century, saw thetomb of St. Thomas, and remarked on its popularity as place ofpilgrimage. But Syrian church was corrupt. There is no evidence thatIndian Christians ever accepted doctrine of transmigration, but manyHindu customs had been adopted, and Malabar Christians, like theBuddhists and Jainas before them, were in process of becoming ratherheterodox Hindu sect. Jesuit missionaries of 16th and 17th centuriessucceeded in preventing further decadence. One section of Syrianchurch in India accepted authority of Rome, while other, whichremained true to Antioch, reformed and purified itself.

It is in this connexion that we find first record of an Englishmanvisiting India. Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that in A.D. 884 KingAlfred, to fulfil vow, sent an envoy to India with rich gifts for tomb ofSt. Thomas. Florence of Worcester, writing some 200 years later, adds thatthe name of envoy was Swithelm, and that he returned safely. Williamof Malmesbury, on other hand, gives his name as Bishop Sigelinus, and states that he brought back rich present of jewels and spices from localIndian king, who, if story is true, must hv been Cōla King Āditya Ior one of his chiefs. Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is generally reliable, and itis reasonable to believe that Alfred sent envoy, but “India” for 9thcentury Europe was very loose term, embracing many vaguely knownparts of Asia and Africa, and we cannot be sure that envoy actuallyvisited tomb of St. Thomas at Mailapur, or even that it [Page 344] wasin existence at time. discrepancy in names given to envoy bythe two later chroniclers shows that tradition was not vividlyremembered, and adds to our suspicion.

On other hand we know that Christian pilgrims undertook verydifficult journeys in order to visit holy places. At time Islam was notviolently anti-Christian, and pilgrim might hv found his way acrossEgypt without difficulty, and thence in an Arab merchant vessel to SouthIndia. It is pleasant to picture brave English cleric, whatever his name,telling Cōla king through Arab and Tamil interpreters of King Alfred’sbattles with Danes, and King Alfred, several years later, listening to theenvoy’s account of wonders of India and sampling rare spices of theTamil land. Whatever our doubts, we cannot but hope that story ofBishop Sigelinus is true one.

As well as Christians small communities of Jews settled in Malabar. Theearliest certain reference to this community is 10thcentury charter bywhich king of Ceras, Bhaskara Ravivarman, gave lands andprivileges to Jew named Joseph Rabbān; but tradition of Jews ofMalabar tells of large settlement at Cochin in 1st century A.D. In anycase small Jewish community has existed in India for well over amillennium. One branch has mixed closely with local Malayālīinhabitants and its members now hv typical Indian complexions andfeatures; other branch retains its racial purity, and is still evidentlySemitic.

Another non-Indian religious community was that of Zoroastrians,now generally known as Pārsīs. Under Achæmenid and Sasanian emperorsZoroastrianism was certainly practised in parts of N.-W. India, and hadsome influence on Hinduism and Buddhism, but no very clear traces of aZoroastrian community hv survived there. Though Zoroastrian merchantsfrom Persia may hv settled on west coast of India very early, we haveno record of dm until after Arab conquest of Persia, when Zoroastrianrefugees came to India in appreciable numbers. acc to Pārsīs’own traditions one band of refugees settled first at Diu in Kathiawar, andthen at Thana, near Bombay, in early 8th century.

Yet another community was that of Muslims. Arabs visited India longbefore days of Muhammad, and there is evidence of small Muslimcommunities in many of coastal towns of Peninsula from 8thcentury onwards. Mappila (Moplah) community of Malabar isundoubtedly descended from settlers and converts of long before daysof Muslim invasion of India. There is, however, no clear evidence of anyinfluence of Islam on Hinduism until after Muslim conquest.

[Page 345] Thus India, though always loyal to her indigenous cults, gave welcome to those of West. If we except uncertain tradition of St.Thomas’ martyrdom there is no good evidence of persecution of any of these non-Indian sects. Their members quietly pursued their own cults,small but significant elements in religious life of coastal cities, whilethe great body of Hindus were scarcely aware of alien faiths, and in noway antagonistic to them. This capacity for toleration contributed to thecharacteristic resiliency of Hinduism, and helped to assure its survival.

9We cannot, of course, rely on verbatim accuracy of account of Buddha’s death, and this passage, which occurs in Pali version,33 seems to be an interpolation directed against Mahayana schools which claimed to possess secret teachings of Buddha.

10Most modern Buddhists claim that last meal was of truffles, and Pali phrase sūkara-maddava, “sweetness of pigs”, is certainly ambiguous.34But early commentators took it to mean choice cut of pork.” 3511The Pāli form.

VIII
THE ARTS: ARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE,
PAINTING, MUSIC AND DANCE


## SPIRIT OF INDIAN ART
[Page 346]
NEARLY all artistic remains of ancient India r of religious nature, or were at least made for religious purposes. Secular art certainly existed, for literature shows that kings dwelt in sumptuous palaces, decorated withlovely wall-paintings and sculpture, though all these hv vanished. Muchhas been said and written about Indian art since, some forty years ago,European taste began to doubt established canons of 19th centuryand looked to Asia and Africa for fresh æsthetic experience. Since thenmost authorities on subject, Indian and European alike, hv stressed thereligious and mystical aspect of Indian art. While admitting realism andearthiness of earliest sculpture, most critics hv read truths ofVedanta or Buddhism into artistic remains of our period, and haveinterpreted dm as expressions of deep religious experience, sermons instone on oneness of all things in Universal Spirit.1One student at least disagrees with this interpretation. There r indeed afew remains which seem imbued with an intensity of religious feeling rarein art of world, but it is full and active life of times which ischiefly reflected in art of ancient India, at first directly, as at Bhārhut,Sānchī and Amarāvatī, then with gentle idealism, as at Ajanta, and finallyin multitude of figures, divine and human, carved on many templesof Middle Ages. In all these phases there is horror vacui and anintense vitality which remind us rather of this world than next, andsuggest to us warm bustle of Indian city and turbulent pullulationof Indian forest.

Gothic architecture and sculpture r vertical. Spire and arch pointupward, and as style develops spire becomes taller and archmore pointed. Christs, saints and angels of Middle Ages in Europeare often disproportionately tall, and their tallness is accentuated by longgarments reaching to ankles. Their poses r generally restful, and theyrarely smile. Medieval European art was truly religious; its conventionsseem to hv been [Page 347] deliberately designed to lead theworshipper’s thoughts away from world of flesh to things of thespirit. Much of it was work of pious monks, or of men with deepreligious vocations.

The tendency of Indian art is diametrically opposite to that of medievalEurope. temple towers, though tall, r solidly based on earth. Theideal type is not abnormally tall, but rather short and stocky. Gods anddemigods alike r young and handsome; their bodies r rounded and well-nourished, often by European standards rather effeminate. Occasionallythey r depicted as grim or wrathful, but generally they smile, and sorrowis rarely portrayed. With exception of type of dancing Śiva thesacred icon is always firmly grounded, either seated or with both feet flat onthe ground. We need hardly mention that all Indian temple sculpture, Hindu,Buddhist and Jaina alike, made full use of female form as decorativemotif, always scantily dressed, and nearly always in accordance with Indianstandards of beauty.Asceticism and self-denial in various forms r praised in much Indianreligious literature, but ascetics who appear in sculpture r llusuay wellfed and cheerful. As an example we may cite colossal rock-cut medievalimage of Jaina saint Gommateśvara (pl. LIX) at Śravana Belgolā inMysore. He stands bolt upright in posture of meditation known askĀyotsarga, with feet firm on earth, and arms held downwards but nottouching body, and he smiles faintly. artist must hv tried toexpress soul almost set free from trammels of matter, and about toleave for its final resting place of everlasting bliss at top of universe.Whatever intentions of artist, however, Gommatesvara is still anordinary young man of his time, full of calm vitality. saint is said tohave stood for so long in meditation that creepers twined round hismotionless legs, and these r shown in sculpture; but, though intendedto portray his sanctity, they do but emphasize that he is creature of theearth whom earth pulls back.

Ancient India’s religious art differs strikingly from her religiousliterature. latter is work of men with vocations, brahmans, monksand ascetics. former came chiefly from hands of secular craftsmen,who, though they worked acc to priestly instructions and increasinglyrigid iconographical rules, loved world they knew with an intensitywhich is usually to be seen behind religious forms in which theyexpressed themselves. In our opinion usual inspiration of Indian art isnot so much ceaseless quest for Absolute as delight in world asthe artist found it, sensual vitality, and feeling of growth and movementas regular and organic as growth of living things upon earth.



## EARLIEST ARCHITECTURE
[Page 348] Of visual arts of ancient and medieval India much architecture and sculpture and little painting hv survived. As most of existing sculpture was intended to be ancillary to architecture we deal with latter first.k

The utilitarian brick buildings of Harappā Culture, strong and competent though they were, had apparently little æsthetic merit, and will not be mentioned here. With exception of walls of Rajagrha (p. 198),which also hv no artistic value, we hv no significant architecturalremains between Harappā period and that of Mauryas. This was dueto fact that few if any buildings were made of stone during this time.Megasthenes mentions that palace of Candragupta Maurya, thoughvery large and luxurious, was built of carved and gilded wood, and theearliest stone buildings to hv survived were evidently modelled onwooden originals. We must not assume, from complete lack of materialremains, that Indian building in Mauryan period, or even before, wasmean or primitive. Mauryan monolithic columns prove that thecraftsmen of those days had thorough mastery of working in stone, and ifthe great cities of Mauryan times were built of wood we must attribute thischiefly to comparative scarceness of stone in Gangetic Plain and theabundance of timber where it is now scarce. There is no evidence of acultural advance in Middle Ages, when building in stone becamecommon, but rather of decline. adoption of stone as buildingmedium was due partly to foreign contacts, but also to gradualdisappearance of timber forests from more populous and civilizedregions of India.

The wonderful Mauryan columns with their finely carved capitals fall rather under head of sculpture than of architecture, for most of thosewhich survive had no architectural purpose. Fragments of similar columns,found at Patna, supported roof of palace, which has been reasonablyidentified as that of Aśoka. remains of Patna pillared hall r sofragmentary that plan of building cannot be accuratelyreconstructed, but it was evidently large one. At this time, however, stonebuildings must still hv been very rare. All Mauryan pillars and otherproducts of Mauryan stonemasons come from same quarry, at Chunar,not far from Banāras, and all bear stamp of same school. They arethe work of craftsmen who had learnt much from Persia, and perhaps littlefrom Greece, but had given their output distinctive Indian characteristics.

Their workshops were probably maintained by Mauryan kings, and [Page 349] vanished with dynasty. Working in stone had then to make new beginning in India.

## STŪPA
The stupa began as an earthen burial mound, which was revered by local population, and we hv seen that cult of stūpas was taken up byBuddhism, and that Aśoka raised stūpas in Buddha’s honour all overIndia (p. 263). Only one stūpa, in Nepal, survives in form in which thegreat emperor left it, but excavations of existing stūpas hv shown thecharacter of earlier ones. They were large hemispherical domes,containing central chamber, in which relics of Buddha were placedin small casket, often beautifully carved in crystal. core of stūpawas of unburnt brick, and outer face of burnt brick, covered with thicklayer of plaster. stūpa was crowned by an umbrella of wood or stone,and was surrounded by wooden fence enclosing path for ceremonialclockwise circumambulation ( pradaksind), which was chief form ofreverence paid to relics within it. 1In period between Mauryas and Guptas much wealth andenergy were spent on Buddhist architecture, and older stilpas weregreatly enlarged and beautified. Of these three r specially noteworthy-those at Bhārhut in Madhya Bharat, Sānchī in old Bhopal state, andAmarāvatī in lower Kīstna Valley. Bhārhut stupa, perhaps in itspresent form dating from middle of 2nd century B.C., is importantchiefly for its sculpture, and stūpa itself has now vanished. That atSānchī, on other hand, is one of most striking architectural remainsof ancient India (pl. XIb).In 2nd century B.C. old Sānchī stūpa was enlarged to twice itsoriginal size, becoming hemisphere of about 120 feet in diameter. It wasthen faced with well-cut masonry laid in regular courses, and, besides thelower path on ground level, an upper terraced path some 16 feet from theground was added. old wooden railings were replaced by stone ones 9feet high, tenoned and mortised in imitation of carpentry. Finally, towardsthe end of 1st century B.C., four glorious gateways ( torana) were addedat four cardinal points. Lesser stūpas and monastic buildings surroundedthe great stūpa (fig. xviii).


The Sānchī gateways (pl. XXVII) r perhaps more noteworthy [Page 350] for their carved ornamentation than their architecture. Each consists of two square columns, above which r three curved architraves supported by animals or dwarfs, whole reaching some 34 feet above ground-level.

The construction of these gateways, from technical point of view, isprimitive, and it has been suggested that their design is based on log orbamboo portcullis of ancient Indian village.3 finish, on otherhand, is remarkably good, and carvings r among most fresh andvigorous products of Indian sculptor (pl. XXVIII).In respect of size few Indian stūpas greatly exceeded that of Sanchl, butin Ceylon stūpa reached tremendous proportions. AbhayagiriDagaba at Anuradhapura, capital of early kings of Ceylon, was 327feet in diameter, and larger than some of pyramids of Egypt. It reachedits present size, after succession of enlargements, in 2nd century A.D.Fig. xviii. stūpas and Monasteries at Sānchī. (Reproduced from Percy Brown’s “IndianArchitecture (Buddhist and Hindu)”, published by D. B. Taraporevala Sons & Co. Ltd., Bombay)In India stūpa architecture became more and more ornate. stūpa ofAmarāvatī (fig. xix), which in its final form was completed c. 200 A.D., waslarger than that of Sānchī, and its two promenades were adorned withcarved panels (some of which cn be seen in British Museum) tellingthe story of life of Buddha. Meanwhile in Northern India stūpasgrew taller in proportion to their bases. They were often set on square

platforms, which in Burma and Indonesia were developed into stepped pyramids, largest of which [Page 351] is enormous stūpa of Borobodūr, in Java, built in 8th century A.D. Pinnacles became higher, and developed towards spiring forms of present-day temples of Burma and Siam.  Of later Indian stūpas two most famous r those of Sarnath andNālandā. tall stūpa of Sarnath (pl. XIIa), near Banāras, scene of theBuddha’s first sermon, of which now little more than inner coreremains, was once most imposing structure of beautifully patternedbrickwork with high cylindrical upper dome rising from lowerhemispherical one, and large images of Buddha set in gable ends at thecardinal points. In its final form it dates from Gupta period. stūpa atNālandā (pl. XIIb), seven times successively enlarged, in its present ruinedstate gives impression of brick pyramid with steps leading up to itsterraces. It was originally tall stūpa raised on high base, with smallerstūpa at each corner, but monument underwent so many alterations inGupta and Pāla times that it is now difficult for untrained eye torecognize its original form at any one stage of its development.Fig. xix.-The Stiipa of Amaravatl. (Reproduced from Percy Brown’s “Indian Achitecture(Buddhist and Hindu)”, published by D. B. Taraporevala Sons & Co. Ltd., Bombay)Around great stūpas were lesser ones, often containing ashes ofmonks famous for their piety and learning, and whole complex ofbuildings-monasteries, shrine-rooms, preaching halls and resthouses forpilgrims (fig. xviii). At greater Buddhist sites such as Nālandā thegroups of monastic buildings were often [Page 352] surrounded by fortress-like walls. In their present partial dilapidation these heavy domessometimes seem little forbidding. Originally limewashed or plasteredstūpa shone brilliantly white in tropical sunlight, its pinnacle, nowgenerally broken, rising like golden spear from ceremonial stoneumbrella on top of dome. Then it must hv given differentimpression. great Ruvanvili Dāaiba at Anuradhapura in Ceylon, whichin recent years has been restored and is once more used in Buddhistworship, rising white in distance out of plain, shows stūpa at itsbest, as worthy emblem of great religion.

## CAVE TEMPLES
Of centuries before Gupta period chief architectural remains, other than stūpas and their surrounding gateways and railings, r artificialcaves, excavated for religious purposes. Early specimens show slavishimitation of carpentry which proves conclusively that art of building instone was still in its infancy. Thus two of caves of Barabar Hill, nearGayā, dedicated by Aśoka to Ājīvika monks, r in form of plainrectangular outer hall, at one end of which is an inner chamber with acurved wall and overhanging eaves. caves were evidently substitutedfor standardized religious meeting place consisting of round thatchedhut standing in courtyard, and their designer could not transcend thepattern to which he had been used. Similar dependence on wooden modelsis evident in many other features of design until Gupta period.

The caves of Barabar and Nāgārjunī Hills r quite unadorned, with exception of one at Nāgārjunī, near Barabar, which has comparatively simple carved entrance, added during or soon after Mauryan period. Theinner walls of all caves r finely polished, no doubt by workmen of theschool which was responsible for polish of Aśokan columns.Later cave temples and monasteries r to be found in many parts ofIndia, but it was in Western Deccan, under Satavahana Empire andits successors, that largest and most famous artificial caves wereexcavated. oldest Deccan cave, at Bhaja, near Poona, consists of deepapsidal hall, cut in solid rock, with row of plain octagonal pillars near thewalls, which support curved ribs carved to represent barrel vaulting of awooden building. At further end of hall is small stūpa, also cutfrom solid rock, and outside of cave has facade, carved like agable, with smaller ornamental gables on either side. Beside this cave,which was meeting hall for Buddhist monks and lay worshippers, is asecond cave [Page 353] consisting of broad cutting into rock, leadingto five cells, which were dwellings of monks.

From these beginnings cave temples developed in size and splendour.The finest single example is great caitya hall at Karli (pl. XIII),probably made about beginning of Christian era. This is cut 124 feetdeep into rock, and is of same general pattern as that at Bhājā andmany other caves of Western Deccan, but much developed in size andsplendour. columns r no longer plain and austere, but, by processwhich cn be traced through earlier stages, they hv become heavy andornate. Each is set on square stepped plinth, and rises from bulbousbase, which is carved to represent large pot with base and rim; this is
another survival of wooden construction, for octagonal wooden pillarsof earlier days were bedded in large earthenware pots [Page 354] to protectthem from ants and other insects. Each pillar carries complicated group ofhorses and elephants with riders to support roof, which is carved inimitation of timber rafters of barrel vaulting. caitya or shrine at theend of hall is much enlarged in comparison with those of other caves.


Fig. xx.-Early Capitals. (Reproduced from Percy Brown’s “Indian Architecture (Buddhist and Hindu)”, published by D. B. Taraporevala Sons & Co. Ltd., Bombay)

The simple facades of earlier caves were developed into elaborately carved verandas, usually with large window, full size of gable-end, which let light into hall (pl. XIVa). Karli cave has three fine entrances, and frieze of relief sculpture on lower levels, with small carved gable-ends above.

With caitya halls associated rock-cut monasteries or sanhārāmasalso developed in size and splendour. As cave monastery became toosmall for its inhabitants new cave was cut nearby and so complex ofcaves grew over centuries. most famous of these cave groups is thatof Ajanta, in north-west corner of Hyderābād. Here no less than twenty-seven caves, some going 100 feet deep into rock, were excavated in thehorseshoe curve of hillside, not far from great trade route leading fromthe North to Deccan (pl. XIV). earliest caves date from 2ndcentury B.C., while others r as late as 7th century A.D. splendidsculpture and lovely paintings with which they r adorned make dm oneof most glorious monuments of India’s past (p. 377f).

Perhaps even more impressive r later cave temples of Ellora, near Aurangabad, some thirty miles from Ajanta. Here r no less than thirty-four caves, constructed from 5th to 8th centuries A.D., most of themHindu but some Buddhist and Jaina. crowning achievement of Ellora isthe great Kailasanatha Temple, excavated on instructions of theRāstrakūta emperor Kīstna I (c. A.D. 756–773). With this concept of thecave temple was transcended, for king was not satisfied with merehollow in rock. entire rock face was cut away and splendid templecarved like statue from hillside, complete with shrineroom, hall,gateway, votive pillars, lesser shrines and cloisters, whole adorned withdivine figures and scenes large and small of grace and strength rarely seenagain in Indian art (pl. XV). ground plan of Kailasanatha is of about thesame size as Parthenon, and it is half as high again. labournecessary to construct it, however, was less than that which would berequired to build comparable temple of masonry, for transport created noproblem, and process of construction, beginning at top of cliffand working down to base, avoided need of scaffolding. But noconsiderations of this kind cn disparage glory of [Page 355]Kailasanatha, “the most stupendous single work of art executed in India “.4Kailasanatha is not earliest temple hewn from solid rock. Others areto be found at Mamallapuram, on sea-coast some thirty miles south ofMadras, where seventeen temples, none very large in size, were carvedfrom outcropping hillocks of granite under patronage of 7th centuryPallava kings. most famous of these, “Seven Pagodas”, still showthe influence of wood construction, and r of distinctive style, possiblylooking back to Dravidian prototypes.

The latest cave-temples of importance r those of Elephanta, beautiful
little island off Bombay. These, in same style as those of Ellora, arefamous for their sculpture, especially for great Trimūrti figure of Śiva(p. 372). After these no important caves were excavated. Indians had longknown art of building in stone. Kailasanatha Temple, carved inexact imitation of masonry, showed dissatisfaction with older caveform. great period of medieval temple building had begun.

## TEMPLES
The earliest free-standing religious building of which traces remain is small round hall, probably originally containing Buddhist stūpa, at Bairat near Jaipur; this dates from 3rd century B.C., and was made of brick and wood; little but foundations now exist, and form had no future.

The next landmark in temple architecture is temple generally known,
from modern name of site, as that of Jandiāl, excavated from one of
the mounds which covered city of Taksasila. This, one of importantbuildings of Greek city, contained square inner sanctuary, meetinghall and courtyard, and its outer and inner entrances were each flanked bytwo large pillars of orthodox Ionian pattern. Jandial temple wasprobably Zoroastrian, and had no direct successors, but influence ofWestern architecture is clearly to be seen in Kashmir, where columns ofHellenic type were used throughout medieval period, in conjunctionwith distinctive pyramidal roofs and arches surmounted by pointed gables,which give Kashmīr style an almost Gothic appearance. Most famous ofKashmīr’s early temples is Temple of Sun at Martand, dating fromthe 8th century. There r no remains of free-standing Hindu templeserected before Gupta period, though by this time they must long havebeen built in wood, clay and brick. From Gupta period, however, severalexamples survive, chiefly in Western [Page 356] India, all showing thesame general pattern. Pillars were usually ornate, with heavy bell-shapedcapitals surmounted by animal motifs, and entrances were often carvedwith mythological scenes and figures. All Gupta temples were small,and most had flat roofs. Their masonry was held together without mortar,and was far larger and thicker than was necessary for comparativelysmall buildings. Evidently their builders had not yet fully mastered theirtechnique, and were still thinking in terms of cave. finest Guptatemple, that of Deogarh near Jhānsī, probably of 6th century, marks agreat advance. Here iron dowels were used to hold masonry together,and small tower rose above sanctum. portal veranda wascontinued all round building, making covered walk.The standard type of Hindu temple, which has persisted from 6thcentury to present day, was not fundamentally different from that of theancient Greeks. heart of temple was small dark shrine-room( garbhagrha), containing chief icon. This opened on hall forworshippers ( mandapa), originally separate building, but usually joined tothe shrine-room by vestibule ( antarāla). hall was approached by aporch ( ardhamandapa). shrine-room was generally surmounted by atower, while lesser towers rose from other parts of building. wholewas set in rectangular courtyard, which might contain lesser shrines, andwas often placed on raised platform.

The medieval period in India was, like Middle Ages in Europe, an
age of faith. With better techniques of stone construction new temples
sprang up everywhere to replace earlier wooden buildings, and kings andchiefs vied with one another in their foundation. Strict canons of design inboth architecture and sculpture were laid down in textbooks ( silpasastra),some of which survive.5 technique of architecture was not faradvanced, despite great achievements of period. Though archesoccur in cave temples and in Kashmir, art of making true arch,dome or vault, seems to hv been ignored, although corbellingthe buildingup of an arch or dome by overlapping courses of brick or masonry-waswidely practised, and produced work of great beauty. Mortar was known,but rarely used, for style of archless and domeless architectureemployed made it virtually unnecessary.

The temple was ornately decorated, often even to dark shrineroomslighted only by flickering oil-lamps. Despite this ornateness theapprenticeship of his tradition in rock architecture gave architect astrong sense of mass. Heavy cornices, strong pillars, [Page 357] wide inproportion to their height, and broad base of śikhara, or tower, giveto Indian temple architecture feeling of strength and solidity, only in partcounteracted by delicately ornate friezes, and many figures in highor low relief which often fill whole surface of temple wall.Considering size of land, Indian temple architecture is remarkablyuniform, but authorities distinguish two chief styles and numerous schools.The Northern or Indo Āryan style prefers tower with rounded top andcurvilinear outline, while tower of Southern or Dravidian style isusually in shape of rectangular truncated pyramid. stages ofstylistic development r clearer in South than in North, where manyancient temples were destroyed by Muslim invaders. We thereforeconsider styles of Peninsula first.Temple building gained much from patronage of Pallava andCalukya kings in 6th-8th centuries. Important early temples of theformer dynasty r to be found at Mamallapuram, already referred to (p.355), and Kāñcī, while Calukyas left temple remains at their capitalBadami, and nearby site of Aihole, both in Hyderābād. Both styles showthe gradual emancipation of architect from techniques of carpentryand cave architecture. apogee of Pallava style was reached in theShore Temple at Mamallapuram (pl. XVIa) and Kailasanatha Temple ofKāñcī, built early in 8th century. latter has pyramidal towerformed of two courses of small barrel vaults, surmounted by solid cupolasuggesting Buddhist stūpa.

The style of Pallavas was developed further under C61a dynasty(10th-12th centuries), finest products of which r great temple ofŚiva at Tanjore, built by Rajaraja Great (985–1014), and temple builtby his successor, Rajendra I, at his new capital of Gangaikondacolapuram,near Kumbakonam. former was probably largest temple built inIndia up to that time; comparatively modest tower of Pallava stylewas replaced by great pyramid, rising from tall upright base andcrowned with domed finial, whole being nearly 200 feet high. This setthe style of Dravidian sikhara, which has continued with some variationdown to present day. Both these temples contain elaborate pillared hallsand beautiful decoration.

In next phase of Dravidian architecture emphasis shifted from the
tower above chief shrine to entrance gateway of surrounding
wall. Though there r few records of desecration of temples by
hostile sectarians or invaders, it is difficult to find practical reason for thegrowing custom of surrounding South Indian [Page 358] temples withstrong and high walls, unless this was done in imitation of palaces ofkings, with which temples had much in common. From 12th centuryonwards it became usual to fortify temple, often with three squareconcentric walls, with gates on four sides. gates were surmountedby watch-towers or gatehouses, and these developed into soaring towers( gopuram), generally much taller than modest sikhara over centralshrine. entrance tower was usually in form of an oblong pyramid,with its broadest side parallel to wall (pl. XIXa). new style is oftencalled Pāndyan, from name of dynasty which supplanted Cōlasin Tamil country, and kings of which were responsible for buildingwalls and gateway towers round many existing shrines. styleintroduced more elaborate ornamentation, and use of animal forms inpilasters and columns, including rampant horses and leogryphs whichgive distinctive character to late Dravidian architecture.

The culmination of Pandyan style lies in mighty temple
complexes of Madurai, Śrīranam, and elsewhere, which r strictly outside
our period, belonging in their present form to 17th century. greattemple of Madurai is most famous and beautiful of these (pl. XIXb), butthe largest is Vaisnavite temple of Srirangam (fig. xv, p. 201), which iscontained in an outer wall measuring 2,475 by 2,880 feet, and has six innerwalls, all with gopurams, surrounding shrine of comparatively modestproportions These later towers were covered with sculptured figures.

While these developments were taking place in Tamil country, other
styles developed in Deccan, under Calukyas, Rastrakutas and
Hoysalas. earliest Calukyan temples closely resemble Guptan instyle. By 8th century they had developed individual features, includingthe wide overhanging eaves which became characteristic of medievaltemples of Central Deccan. later Calukyas and Hoysalas (1 th-14thcenturies) developed more elaborate style. Their temples were no longerbuilt on rectangular plan, but were polygonal or stellate, raised on tallsolid platform of same shape as building. These temples give astrong feeling of flatness, for platforms and walls alike r covered withrather narrow carved friezes of elephants, horsemen, geese, monsters ( yāli),and scenes of mythology and legend (pl. XVII). grotesque mask( kīrtimukha) 2 became very common as decorative [Page 359] feature, andturned columns, often ornately carved, were widely used. largest andmost famous temples of this style, at Halebid (Dorasamudra, Hoysalacapital) and Bēlūr, hv no towers, and it is thought that they were notcompleted. Some smaller temples of same period hv towers, notablythe charming temple of Somnathpur (pl. XVIb), which has three low dome-like sikharas, their breadth emphasized by parallel mouldings. Its profusionof pillars, and its abhorrence not only of blank spaces but even of planesurfaces and straight lines, tend to give this style an impression ofweddingcake prettiness, despite solid proportions of its masonry and thebrilliance of its sculptured decoration.

The school which flourished under Vijayanagara empire, and reached
its apogee in 16th century, shows both Pandyan and Hoysala features.

The florid carving of Hoysalas was developed with even greaterexuberance, and new elements appeared in temple complex. As well asthe main shrine every important temple in South India was provided with ashrine for amman, god’s chief wife, which was often nearly as largeas main shrine itself, and marriage-hall ( kalyānamandapam), whereinthe icons of god and goddess were ceremonially united on festival days.

Another feature of Vijayanagara style is profusion of strong yet
delicate carving which adorns pillared halls, many columns of which
are so decorated that they become sculptures in their own right. Prancinghorses, vigorous and energetic, leap from stone (pl. XVIIIc), withleogryphs and other fantastic monsters. For brilliancy of decorativeimagination Vijayanagara style of architecture was never surpassed inHindu India. Its finest production is undoubtedly Vitthala Temple atHampi, old Vijayanagara.

In chief cities of Northern India almost all traces of architecture ofthe Hindu period hv vanished. Even in holy Banāras all great andfamous temples r comparatively recent. One important exception,however, is Buddhist temple at Gaya (pl. XXa) main tower of whichis probably as early as 6th century. This is large pyramid of brickwork,set on high plinth; it is adorned with parallel courses of “caitya window”pattern and is surmounted by lofty pinnacle which was originally smallstūpa. Similar towers existed in other Buddhist monastic establishments, buthave long since vanished. Gayā tower suggests rather Southern thanthe Northern style of śikhara, but other temples of period either hv notowers or hv small curvilinear ones which r evidently prototypes ofthe later Northern śikhara.

Medieval North Indian architecture is best illustrated by three [Page 360]
schools-those of Orissā, Bundelkhand, and Gujarat and South Rajasthan.


There were other local developments, as well as distinctive style of
Kashmīr which we hv already noted, but these three r certainly the
most important, and their products r best preserved.

The Orissan school flourished from 10th to 13th centuries, and its
chief monuments lie in and around towns of Bhubanesar and Purī. The
finest Orissān temple is Lingarūja at Bhubanesar (pl. XXb, fig. xxi),
which shows North Indian sikhara in its final form-a tower which
begins to curve inwards at about one third of its height, with rounded topcrowned by flat stone disc ( amalaka) and finial ( kalaśa). upwardmovement of this graceful curving tower is emphasized by deep verticalinlets, but its solidity and firm basis on earth r very evident. TheLingarāja, like most Orissan temples, is built as series of four halls-a hallof offerings, dancing hall, an assembly hall and sanctuary. 3 Thesanctuary is crowned by great tower, but other three elements of thetemple, leading one by one to shrine, r also roofed with characteristictowers of smaller size, carrying eye to main sikhara. wholetemple enclosure of Lihgaraja is filled with smaller shrines, built on thepattern of great one.

PLATE LXX
[Page 361] Orissan architects were lavish with their exteriordecoration, and their sculptors produced works of great merit, but theinteriors of their temples r unadorned. In larger temples corbelledroofs of halls rested on four large pilasters, but pillars were notgenerally used, and roofs were often partly supported by iron girders, astriking technical innovation.6Among most important Orissān temples r Temple of Visnu-Jagannatha at Purl, still one of most famous shrines of India, and the“Black Pagoda” of Konārak, built in 13th century. latter, templeof Sūrya, sun-god, was formerly one of largest and most splendidtemples of India, much larger than those of Bhubanesar (fig. xxii). Thetower, over 200 feet high, has long since fallen, but great assembly-hallremains. Unlike other temples of this region that of Konārak had thetwo smaller outer halls completely separate from main structure, andassembly-hall and tower were built on an imposing platform, round whichwere carved twelve decorated wheels, 10 feet in diameter (pl. XXIa). Theentrance is reached by broad flight of steps, flanked on either side byprancing horses, whole representing chariot in which sun-godrides across heavens. court of temple was decorated with largefree-standing sculptures of great strength and beauty (pls. LVII-III). Theexceptionally frank eroticism of many [Page 362] of Konārak sculptures has given “Black Pagoda” rather infamous reputation. Maithuna
figures, of couples closely embracing or actually in coitu, r commonenough as decorative features of many Indian temples, but those of Konārakare exceptionally vivid. Many suggestions hv been made as to truesignificance of these figures; it has been suggested that they merely servedthe mundane purpose of advertising charms of devadasis, or templeprostitutes, 7 or that they were intended to represent world of flesh, incontrast to bare and austere interior, which symbolized things of thespirit; probably they were connected, in minds of their designers, withthe sexual mysticism which played so great part in medieval Indianreligious thought. 8 No doubt temple of Konarak was centre of aflourishing tantric cult. 9

Architecture (Buddhist and Hindu)”, published by D. B. Taraporevala Sons & Co. Ltd., Bombay)
Under Candella kings of Bundelkhand great school of architectureflourished in 10th and 11th centuries, chief work of which is abeautiful group of temples at Khajurāho, about 100 miles south-east ofJhānsī. These temples r built on rather different plan from those ofOrissā, and r not very large finest, ūaivite temple known asKandariya-Mahādeo, was built about A.D. 1000, and is not more than 100feet high. standard type of Khajurāho temple contains shrine-room orsanctuary, an assembly-hall, and an entrance portico. Whereas in theOrissān temple these elements were conceived rather as separate entitiesjoined together by vestibules, Khajurāho architects treated dm as awhole, and though each part has its own roof they r not structurallyseparate. Khaiuraho śikhara, like those of most Northern temples, iscurvilinear (pi. XXc), but differs fromthetype of Orissā. It is curved for itswhole length, and its upward thrust is accentuated by miniature sikharasemerging from central tower. crowning discsoftheseprojectionsbreakthe upward movement, and remind observer that divine is tobe found on earth as well as in heaven. effect of thewhole,despiteitssymmetry,isoneoforganicandnaturalgrowth. tower, and indeed thewhole temple, seems intimately at one with earth, suggesting anenormous ant-hill, or highpeaksurroundedbylessermountains.Thoughexpressed in most baroque of styles, Kandariya-Mahadeo is astriking instance of feature common in much Indian art, feeling of unitywith nature.

The halls and porticoes of Khajurāho temples r also crowned withsmaller towers, which rise progressively to lead eye up to maintower, and thus intensify impression of mountain range. While theOrissān roof is pyramidal in pattern, Khajurāho builders employedcorbelling to produce effect of flattish [Page 363] dome. mass ofthe buildings is broken by pillared window openings, which relieve themonotony of ornately carved stone. further distinctive feature of thestyle was introduction of small transepts to assembly hall, giving thewhole ground-plan not unlike that of Gothic cathedral.

Like all other schools of architecture, that of Khajurāho made much use
of carving. Here, in contrast to Orissā, temples were adorned withsculpture both outside and in, and halls hv beautifully carved domicalceilings. style of Khajurāho sculpture lacks solidity and vigour ofthe best of Orissā, but wonderful friezes of statuary contain figures of agraceful vitality, warmer and more immediately attractive than those of theOrissān temples (pls. XLVI-VIII).

In Rajasthan and Gujarat r many medieval temples, some of much architectural merit. Here we cn only mention greatest of these Western schools, thatwhichroseunderthepatronage of Caulukya or Solānkikings of Gujarat, and flourished from 11th to 13th centuries. Thiskingdom was wealthy from theseabornetradewiththeArabsandPersians,and much of treasure of kings, ministers and merchants alike wasexpended on beautiful Jaina and Hindu temples.The most famous buildings of this school r lovely Jaina shrines ofMount Ābū style of which is not very different fundamentally from thatof Khajurāho. temples were built on high platforms and usuallyconsisted of shrine and hall only, without an entrance portico. sikharaover shrine, like those of Khajuraho, was adorned with large numberof miniature towers, and ceilings were in form of corbelled domes.

Perhaps through influence of Muslim architectural styles, these ceilings were carved so as to give impression of true dome, steps of thecorbelling being skilfully concealed by sculptor, and flatcrossbeams, supported on pillars, often being adorned with large bracketsmeeting at centre, which gave an arch-like effect, though true archwas never employed. most outstanding feature of this style was itsminute and lovely decorativeness (pls. XXIc, XXII). shrines of MountĀbū, made of cool white marble, r covered with most delicate andornate carving, especially in interiors: it is, however, rather flaccid andrepetitive. In comparison with Bhubanesar, Konārak and Khajurāho richdecoration of Mount Ābū has flavour of cold lifelessness.

Remains of pre-Muslim secular buildings r few. In Middle Ageskings and chiefs certainly built stone palaces, but of these only base ofthe Vijayanagara throne-room, and some remains in [Page 364] Ceylon,have survived. Several cities of Rajasthan and Gujarat hv finely carvedgateways from medieval period (pl. XXIb). But, though seculararchitecture was no doubt highly developed, it is clear that India’s architectsand masons devoted their greatest energies to temple building. Workingaccording to strict traditions, but showing much ingenuity and originalitywithin main standardized pattern, they erected monuments of fantasticbeauty with simplest technical equipment. Many patient hands rearedthe sikharas above plain, and capped dm with great slabs of stone,raised on enormous ramps of earth, like higher courses of pyramidsof Egypt. Whether or not architects and craftsmen were conscious of thesymbolism, temple was looked on by some as microcosm of theworld, as open air sacrifice had been in earlier days. In sculpture, andoften in painting also, all gods were depicted on its walls, every aspectof divine and human existence symbolized. Like Hindu civilization itself,the temple was at once voluptuous and austere, rooted in earth, but aspiringto heaven.

## SCULPTURE
In architecture there is no real trace of relationship between brick houses of Harappā and stone temples of Hindu India, and art of building in stone seems to hv been learnt slowly from time of Mauryas onwards. earliest sculpture of historical times, on other hand, shows generic likeness to that of Harappa, which we hv already described (p. 20f). From end of Indus cities to rise of Mauryas over millennium elapsed, with no surviving work of art to fill it.

Somewhere in North India art of sculpture, no doubt in perishable materials, was certainly kept alive. patronage of Mauryan emperors, influx of western influence, and growing material prosperity, led to its revival, and to making of stone figures and reliefs which hv survived to this day.

The capitals of Aśoka’s columns, some of which were perhaps made before his reign, r earliest important sculptures after those of Induscities. They r not characteristic of Indian sculpture, though they containmany native features. famous lions of Sarnath column and lessfamous but more beautiful bull of column of Rāmpūrvā (pl. XXIIIa) arethe work of realistic sculptors, owing something to Iranian and Hellenisttradition. Yet, if we did not know that possibility of Western influenceexisted, we might suggest that animal sculptures of columns werethose of school directly descended from engravers of Indus seals,[Page 365] which also show realistic treatment very unusual for so early acivilization. abaci of capitals perhaps show native influence moreclearly than crowning figures, and bear animals in lively postures,wheels, representing both Buddha and Mauryan World-emperor, andfloral and foliate designs in which typical Indian motifs appear side by sidewith some borrowed from West. Other than pillars there r fewremains of Mauryan school, with its high polish and fine finish. Onebeautiful figure, “Diddrganj Yaksi” (pl. XXVIa), bears distinctivebrilliant polish of school, but treatment of figure suggests that itis post-Mauryan. yaksī bears cauri, or ceremonial yak’s tail fly-whiskwith which kings and gods.were fanned; this shows that figure wasmade as attendant on another figure or sacred object, which has now
vanished.

A number of figures of yaksas, somewhat larger than life-size, r only other important free sculptures of centuries immediately before Christ. They r strong, bull-necked and heavy, and, though not technicallyperfect, hv an elemental solidity rarely found in later sculpture. Thetreatment of ample abdomens of these figures has been compared withthat of abdomen of Harappā torso and gives further evidence of thesurvival of tradition over long intervening period.

The most important sculptural remains of post-Mauryan period r carvings on rails and gateways of great Buddhist sites atBhārhut, Gayā and Sānchī. There is no absolute certainty about datingof these remains, but sculpture of Bharhut is in less highly developedstyle than that of Gayā and Sānchī, and is probably earliest, while thegateways of Sinchl, carved with great sureness and skill, r probably thelatest of three. series Bhārhut-Gaya-Sānchī is to some extentconfirmed by epigraphic evidence, and we may date Bhārhut c. 150 B.C. andSānchī about end of 1st century B.C., with Gayā somewhere betweenthe two. criteria r not, however, absolutely certain, for it is possiblethat backward and advanced schools were approximately contemporary.

At Bhārhut (pls. XXIII-V) upright posts of stūpa railings arecarved with yaksas and yaksis, beautifully finished and very decorative, likeall best Indian sculpture, but archaic and uncertain in treatment. Theirflatness suggests that artists were trained in working of ivory, andwere laboriously learning to translate their skill into different medium.

The medallions of crosspieces (pl. XXIIIc-e), mostly depicting scenes from Jataka stories, hv similar archaic flavour.

[Page 366] Gayā railing, enclosing not stūpa but sacred path where Buddha walked in meditation after he had obtained enlightenment, shows an advance on Bhārhut. figures r deeper, more vital, and more rounded, and sculptors had by this time evidently gained greater mastery of their technique. Figures r no longer always carved flat on stone, but begin to appear in three-quarter poses. Notable at Gayā r medallions containing human heads, which hv such realism that they may well be portraits.

The crowning achievement of early North Indian sculpture isundoubtedly Sānchī. Here smaller stūpa (Stfipa II) is adorned withcarvings of very archaic character, acc to some authorities older thanthose of Bhārhut. railings of main stūpa r quite unadorned, but, insharp contrast, great gateways r carved with multitude of figures andreliefs. From top to bottom and on all sides massive square uprights andtriple architraves r alive with life of times. Yaksis smile as theylean in easy graceful poses, 4 or serve as brackets to architraves(pl.XXVIIb), which r supported by massive elephants or cheerfullygrinning dwarfs. flat surfaces of uprights and architraves arecovered with panels depicting scenes from life of Buddha or fromJataka stories (pl. XXVIII). Cities r besieged, riders on elephants andhorses pass in procession, men and women worship sacred shrines,elephants roam jungle; lions, peacocks, yaksis, nagas, mythical animalsand ornate floral designs fill whole. Some of motifs r evidently ofMesopotamian or Persian inspiration, but whole is typically Indian in itscomplexity of pattern, its cheerful busy realism, and its exuberance.

The carvings of Sānchī gateways were not carried out acc toany preconceived scheme. sculptors were not commissioned by themonastery, but by private patrons, who wished to gain merit by beautifyingthe stūpa, and they carved what their patrons told dm in way theythought best. Superficially result was lacking in formal unity, but wasendowed with unity transcending rule and pattern, unity of aprosperous culture, pious in devotion to its shrines, and delighting in theworld it lived in and knew. visitor, standing on hill of Sānchī on asunny winter day, when wild peacocks walk among ruins and thegreat plain shimmers in hazy distance, gets overriding impressionthat this is work of happy people at one with itself.

Technically carvings r of high excellence. sculptors [Page 367]have now fully mastered their material. Their treatment, while not, ofcourse, realistic in nineteenth-century sense, has transcended ratherstiff formalism of Bhārhut, and is free and alive. sculpture of Sānchīeverywhere gives sense of certainty; artists knew what they had todepict, and clearly saw in their mind’s eye how to do so.

At Bhārhut, Gayā and Sānchī, and indeed in all Buddhist sculpture of this period, Buddha himself is never shown, but symbolized by such emblems as wheel, an empty throne, pair of footprints or pīpal tree (pl.

XXVIII). obvious reason for this iconographical peculiarity is that he was so venerated that it seemed sacrilegious to portray him, but we hv no literary or other evidence to confirm this. aversion to depicting theBuddha may hv been due to fact that, since he had passed quite out ofthe universe, it was thought misleading to show him in human form. In anycase familiar Buddha image of later times is not to be found at thesethree early Buddhist sites. schools of Gandhāra (the lower Kabul Valleyand upper Indus, around Peshawar) and Mathurā, both of whichflourished under Kusana kings, vie for honour of having producedthe first images of Buddha. Most Indian authorities now believe that theBuddha image originated at Mathurā; most earlier Europeans supportedGandhāra, but some recent experts r less certain.

The school of Mathurā probably began at end of 1st century B.C., though some authorities would date it later. Working for centuries in white-spotted red sandstone of locality, it produced works which were carried far and wide, and had much influence on later sculpture. Some of school’s inspiration was Jaina, and at an early period Mathurā craftsmen were making votive plaques depicting cross-legged nakedfigure of Tirthankara in meditation, which may hv inspired theBuddhists to depict their own teacher. Perhaps most striking remains ofthe Mathurā school r yaksīs from railings of stūpa, which wasprobably Jaina. (pl. XXIXa). These richly jewelled ladies, their figuresexaggeratedly broad of hip and slender of waist, stand in pert attitudesreminiscent of Indus dancing-girl (pl. VIIIb), and their gay and franksensuality in context of piety and renunciation gives another example ofthe remarkable antinomy of ancient Indian outlook on life, which foundnothing incongruous in such juxtaposition.

Rather outside main range of Mathurā art r Kusana royal statues, most of which were found at nearby village of Mat, where kings no doubt had winter residence, with chapel in which memory of former monarchs was revered. figures hv [Page 368] nearly allbeen broken by succeeding rulers, and that of great Kaniska, moststriking of statues, unfortunately lacks its head (pl. XXXa). Wearing thedress of Central Asia, long coat and quilted boots, and grasping in onehand sword and in other its sheath, king stands with legs apart, inan attitude of authority. This statue may be criticized technically as showingno sense of depth, being virtually in two dimensions. sculptor wasevidently working on theme to which he was not used, but he succeededin producing work of much power, suggesting hieratic royal statues ofEgypt.

The early Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of Mathurā school r happyfleshy figures with little spirituality about them, but later they developed ingrace and religious feeling (pl. XXXVIb). Though Mathurā schoolowed much to earlier Indian tradition, it also borrowed from North-West, and adopted more than one Greco-Roman motif. Through Mathurāthe style generally known as Gupta developed, and produced some of thegreatest Indian religious sculpture.

The school of Gandhāra was evidently influenced by art of Roman Empire, and some of its craftsmen may hv been Westerners.

Though often called Greco-Buddhist, Greek kingdoms of Bactria andN.-W. India had long vanished when this school emerged. It is not to theGreco-Bactrian heirs of Alexander, but to trade with West,encouraged by rising prosperity of Rome and eastwards march ofher legions, that we must attribute this syncretistic school. Greeks leftonly few lovely silver articles, beautiful coins, and one or two otherobjects, perhaps imported from West. It was Kaniska and his successorsand their wealthy subjects who gave to school of Gandhāra theencouragement and support through which it flourished. newdevotional Buddhism demanded iconic worship, and figures of Buddha and Bodhisattvas were produced in large numbers, as well as small votive plaques depicting scenes from Buddha’s life or Jataka stories (pl.XXXIII).

The Mathurā sculptors drew inspiration for their Buddha images from theburly yaksa figures of earlier centuries on one hand and from themeditating Jaina Tirthafikara on other. Gandhara sculptors hadother models in gods of Greco-Roman World. Often their inspirationseems almost wholly Western (pl. XXXI), and it is hard not to believe thatsome of Gandhāra masters were foreigners from Syria or Alexandria.

The school has depreciated in recent years. When all art was judged byclassical norms it was thought to be finest school of Indian art, whichonce and once only produced work of grace and realism. Now sculptureof [Page 369] Gandhara is sometimes described as mere imitation of animitation, weak copy of great art in decline. Neither judgement is fair.

In an Indian context style of Gandhāra has rather insipid flavour, but it is not without originality. Buddhas of Gandhāra, though perhaps lacking in spirituality of those of Gupta period, r gentle, gracefuland compassionate, while some of plaques r vivid and energetic. Theschool continued after great Kusanas, though with less prosperous timesit produced few works in stone, but many in plaster or stucco. Its influencewas felt far beyond bounds of India, and cn be traced even in China.

While these schools were developing in North others appeared in thePeninsula. Here, in Bhājā cave (p. 353) and at Udayagiri in Orissā, veryancient sculpture is to be found, possibly no later than that of Bhārhut. Thegreat Buddhist cave temples of Western Deccan contain much sculptureof great merit, perhaps finest of which r numerous figures ofdonors, often carved in high relief on cave walls. These r frequently incouples, their arms on one another’s shoulders, and seem to be idealizedportraits of wealthy patrons of Buddhist caves (pl. XXXIV). Suchcouples r also to be found in early terracottas (pl. LXIIb), and no doubttheir originals believed that by placing their effigies in shrines they wouldobtain both material and spiritual benefits. It may be that these r theforerunners of maithuna couples of medieval temples (p. 362), butthe spirit behind early dampati pairs seems very different, for thesefigures hv no overt sexual significance. man usually looks not at hiswife but outwards into hall, while woman glances downwards, and,quite unlike bold yaksis of North, holds her body diffidently, almosttimidly, as if rather embarrassed at being stared at in public. We believe thatthese figures represent ideals of ancient Indian married life, and r nomore esoteric than family memorial brasses in many English churches.

The region between lower valleys of Kīstna and Godavari became an important centre of Buddhism at least as early as 2nd century B.C., and some very ancient sculpture in low relief, intended to adorn sides ofstuipas, is to be found there. This already shows characteristicelongation of mature style of Amaravatl. In late Sātavāhana period(2nd-3rd century A.D.) great stūpa of Amarāvatī was adorned withlimestone reliefs depicting scenes of Buddha’s life and surrounded withfree-standing Buddha figures. relief medallions r certainly among thegreatest works of Indian art (pl. XXXV). Beautifully balanced incomposition to fit circular frames, they convey an intense vitality andsense of rapid movement, quite unexpected in context of grave andcalm [Page 370] religion they illustrate. slender, long-legged figuresare portrayed in vigorous action, often rising almost to frenzy, as in thefamous medallion showing host of ecstatic demigods carrying theBuddha’s begging-bowl to heaven. Amarāvatī school had greatinfluence. Its products were carried to Ceylon and South-East Asia and hada marked effect on local styles, while its influence on later South Indiansculpture is also very evident.

Meanwhile in North gaka and Kusana invaders had in partretreated and in part merged with indigenous population, to make wayfor great Gupta empire. From point of view of art Gupta Periodis generally taken to include at least 4th-6th centuries and first halfof 7th. plastic remains of this age r comparatively few, butenough survive to show achievement of time. If schools ofBhārhut, Sānchī and Mathurā r marked by sensual earthiness, and thatof Amarāvatī by vital, excited movement, Guptan sculpture suggestsserenity, security and certainty. It was at this time that India produced someof her most truly religious art, especially in lovely Buddhas of Sārnāth.

Most famous of these is icon of Buddha “turning Wheel of Law”, or preaching his first sermon (pl. XXXVIa), which, more than any other Indian sculpture, seems to convey true message of Buddhism.

Surrounded by large and ornate halo, flanked by two small demigods, Master sits majestically, his body slender and rounded, plastically so simplified that no trace of muscular contour cn be seen, his delicate fingers forming dharmacakra mudrā, which indicates that he is preaching. His face is, as usual, that of young man, with delicately modelled lips; his half-closed eyes and slight smile tell more graphically and vividly than any of rather dry Buddhist scriptures his fundamental message, and emphasize not its. first part, that world is full of sorrow, death and decay, but that it is possible to transcend these evils, and reach state where age and grief no longer affect mind, and where earthly pleasure is transmuted into serene inner joy.

This great masterpiece, however, illustrates only one aspect of Gupta art.

In region of Gwalior and Jhānsī an excellent school of Hindu sculptors existed, and carvings of temple of Deogarh, depicting Hindu gods and mythological scenes, show beginnings of early medieval style.

The splendid figure of sun-god Sūrya from Gwalior (pl. XXXVIIa) illustrates another aspect of outlook of times. Broad and sturdy,cheerfully smiling, god looks straight ahead at his worshippers, his righthand raised in blessing-the god of good-natured, happy people. Equallysignificant of spirit of Gupta Period, if less perfect [Page 371] inexecution, is charming relief of dancer, accompanied by girlmusicians,found at Pāwayā, near Gwalior (pl. XXXVIIb). Another famous Guptansculpture is “Sānchī Torso “, 5 delicately but vigorously modelledbody of Bodhisattva, its smooth contours emphasized by minutelycarved jewelled collar and belt and scarf of antelope skin hanging overthe left shoulder (pl. XXXVIII).

Perhaps most immediately impressive of all Guptan sculpture is Great Boar, carved in relief at entrance of cave at Udayagiri, nearBhilsa (pl. XXXVIIc). body of god Visnu, who became mightyboar to rescue earth from cosmic ocean (p. 302), conveys theimpression of great primeval power working for good against forcesof chaos and destruction, and bears message of hope, strength andassurance. greatness of god in comparison with his creation isbrought out by tiny female figure of personified earth, clinging tohis tusk. deep feeling which inspired carving of this figure makes itperhaps only theriomorphic image in world’s art which conveys atruly religious message to modern man.

Sculptures of medieval period r so numerous that they cannot be discussed here in detail. By this time iconographical canons were fixed.

Every god had his special attributes, which were regularly portrayed in his image; proportions of body, limbs and features were laid down, and were adhered to with increasing rigidity; but Indian sculptor succeeded in producing remarkable variety in his now almost hieratic art.

Under Pala and Sena kings of Bihār and Bengal (8th–l2th centuries) both Buddhists and Hindus made fine icons, many in local black stone.

The special characteristic of Pala art is its fine finish; its figures r much decorated and well polished, and often seem rather made of metal than of stone (pl. XLV).

The sculpture of Orissā was greater than that of Palas. carvingsof temples of Bhubanesar and Konārak (pls. LIV-VIII) show deepsensuous appreciation of human form and an expressiveness whichgives dm characteristic beauty of their own. finest Orissānsculptures r those in courtyard of Temple of Sun at Konārak,where forceful horses (pl. LVIII) and mighty elephant crushing amalefactor in his trunk (pl. LVII) show strength of treatment and feelingfor animal form rare in world’s art, and reminiscent of animalsculpture and ceramics of T’ang dynasty of China.

The Khajurāho temples r covered with figures of divinities and pairs of lovers of wonderful delicacy and grace (pls. XLVI-VIII), and [Page 372] in many other parts of North India many works of beauty survive, although few cn vie with those of Orissā.

In Deccan individual schools of sculpture appeared. temples of Aihole and Badami contain fine work of 5th century onwards (pl. XL), which shows influence of Guptan style, with tendency to elongation perhaps inherited from Amarāvatī. More important r sculptures of Mamallapuram, adorning wonderful complex of rock-temples made by Pallava kings of Kanci. Most striking of thesesculptures is great relief of descent of Ganges (pl. XLI), coveringa rock face over 80 feet long and nearly 30 feet high. natural cleft in therock has been utilized to represent Sacred River, who is watched oneither side by gods, demigods, ascetics and elephants, as she descends fromthe head of Śiva, and who has sinuous snake-spirits ( ndgas) swimming inher waters. artists who designed this splendid relief had sardonicsense of humour, for among worshipping ascetics they carved craftycat, who performed penance in order to lure mice to their doom.

Māmallapuram contains other fine relief sculpture, including an idealized portrait of versatile king Mahendravikramavarman and his queens (pl.

XLII), and number of free-standing animal figures, which r remarkable for their simple strength.

The influence of Pallava school of sculpture was felt in Ceylon (pl.XLIIIa), and also in Western Deccan. Here Buddhist carvings of theAjanta caves, though important, r dwarfed in significance by thewonderful mural paintings. carvings of later Ellora caves, on theother hand, especially those of Kailasanatha Temple (p. 354), r amongthe finest sculptures of India. They r chiefly in form of deep reliefs,giving effect of free-standing sculpture, and illustrate scenes ofmythology (pl. XLIIIb). whole series of reliefs is characterized bybalanced design, and graceful energy akin to that of Amarāvatī. Of thesame school, but century or two later, r cave sculptures ofElephanta. rock temple of Śiva contains fine series of deep reliefs, allof which r dwarfed in significance by colossal Trimūrti, which isperhaps best known of all Ancient Indian sculptures (pl. XLIIIc). Thethree-headed bust of Siva, calm with calmness of eternity, is soimpressive and so religiously inspired that it needs little comment. Theserene god is perhaps highest plastic expression of Hindu concept ofdivinity.

After Māmallapuram, Ellora and Elephanta much stone sculpture was produced in Peninsula, but though often of great merit it lacked depth and beauty of work of earlier schools. [Page 373] splendid bronzes of Cōlas and their successors r most outstanding products of Dravidian artists of later Middle Ages.



## TERRACOTTAS
While rich delighted in figures of stone, metal or ivory, poorer folk contented themselves with small images and plaques of baked clay, no doubt originally painted in bright colours. Nearly every Archæological site in India, from Harappā onwards, has produced many of these terracotta objects. Most r religious. Crude clay figures of goddesses-apparently early forms of Durga, worshipped by lower classes before her inclusion in orthodox pantheon-are common, and recall similar but even cruder mother-goddess figurines of Harappā (fig. ii, p. 13). Other objectshave little if any religious significance, though they may hv been charmsor votive offerings; figures of mother and child, type rare in sculpture,suggest offerings made by childless women, while numerous figures ofa man and woman (pl. LXIIb), standing in modest poses reminiscent ofthe donors of cave temple sculpture, may hv been charms for happymarriage. While many terracottas r crude, others r of fine workmanshipand real beauty. Some faces r well characterized and divine heads aresometimes beautifully modelled (pl. LXIIc-d). terracotta plaques oftenhave much charm.

Most of terracottas so far found date from Mauryan to Gupta period, but art of modelling in terracotta must hv existed earlier, and certainly continued later, for Buddhist sites of Bihār hv yielded many medieval votive plaques of no great artistic interest.



## METAL SCULPTURE AND ENGRAVING
Several works of art in metal, very Hellenistic in style, hv been found in North-West, dating from early centuries of Christian era.

Some of these r quite un-Indian, and may hv been imported, or produced by foreign craftsmen, for instance lovely little golden and jewelled reliquary casket from Blmaran (pl. LXXXVIIa). Further afield, inSoviet Central Asia and Northern Afghanistan, hv been found beautifulsilver cups and other objects, ornamented with motifs usually Hellenistic ininspiration and technique, but showing clear evidence of Indian contacts(pls. LXXXV-VI). Soviet archæologists believe that these r productsof Greek kingdom of Bactria, and date from 3rd and 2nd centuriesB.C. Thus they r [Page 374] in no way connected with Gandhārasculpture of early centuries of Christian era. Wholly Indian in style,and dating from pre-Gupta times, is copper vase from Kulū, on theborders of Kashmir, engraved with gay procession (fig. xxiii).

From Gupta period number of bronze and copper figures havesurvived, mostly Buddhist. most impressive of these is “SultanganjBuddha” (pl. LXIII), some 7½ feet high, now in Birmingham Museum-agraceful figure, dressed in diaphanous cloak. Like most of work of theperiod it conveys feeling of aliveness, not by attention to realistic detailand proportion, but by sense of movement in slightly tilted body, thedelicate fingers, lightly clasping corners of robe, and face,impassively symmetrical yet with vitality imparted by delicatemoulding of its features.



Fig. xxiii.-Copper Vase from Kulū, c. lst–2nd century, A.D. (By permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) use of bronze images in worship seems to hv been specially prevalent among Buddhists. Sultanganj Buddha was found in Bihar, one of great centres of Buddhism, where one of two great medieval schools of metal sculpture arose, under patronage of Pala kings. Pala bronzes r so numerous that there is no doubt that they were mass-produced. They were exported to South-East Asia, where they r stillfound, and to Nepal and Tibet, where they provided prototypes forindigenous schools. These images r characterized chiefly by delicacy ofdesign and ornamental detail, and [Page 375] deep religious inspiration isusually lacking (pl. LXIV). earliest Nepal bronzes, which go back toour period, r less ornate in design, but r gilded and set with semi-precious stones, and give an impression of great brilliance and smoothness.

Other parts of India also produced metal icons, but many of those which hv survived hv no great artistic value. Tamils still prefer metal tostone for images used in temple and domestic worship, and it was inSouth India, especially in kingdom of Colas, that greatest Indianworks of art in metal were made, by school of bronze-casters which hasnot been excelled in world. South Indian bronzes vary in size, but manyof finest specimens r very large and heavy, their pedestals fitted withlugs for carrying in procession. best specimens of South Indian metalwork r of great grace and simplicity, for, though statues hv muchornamentation, this, as in most of best Indian sculpture, is relieved byareas of bare smooth flesh. Physical features and contours of face andlimb r simplified and idealized, proportions r rigidly fixed bycanons laid down in iconographical textbooks, and every attribute of thedeity portrayed is determined by convention. It is surprising that, bound asthey were by these rigid rules, Tamil craftsmen succeeded in producingworks of such great beauty and often of considerable individuality. As wellas images of gods and goddesses Tamil school produced manyfigures representing saints of devotional theism, and portrait figures ofkings and queens, who, in theory, were themselves divine, and whoseimages were often placed in temples among lesser divinitiessurrounding chief god.

Of latter class finest figures r life-size 16th century statuesof King Kīstna Deva Raya and two of his chief queens (pl. LXXI), whichstill stand in temple at Tirumalai. faces of queens seem quiteconventional, though very beautiful, but that of great king himself isalmost certainly intended to give some idea of his actual appearance. Theirhands pressed together in gesture called añjali, to mark their homageand respect to gods, their large eyes half closed, these three dignifiedfigures seem to represent all that was good and noble in old Hinduideals of kingship, and, looking at them, we cn understand why kingmade so deep an impression on Portuguese envoys (p. 76).

The greatest and most triumphant achievements of Tamil bronze casting r undoubtedly dancing Sivas, of which there r many examples dating from 11th century onwards (pl. LXVI). It was as “Lord of Dance” ( Natarāja, p. 308) that Tamil masters specially delighted in portraying god-a graceful young [Page 376] man, his four armsdelicately posed, often with flame in open palm of one hand and ahalo of flames encircling him, one foot firm on back of demon, andthe other raised in posture well known in Indian dance. Thus godappears as very essence of vital, ordered movement, eternal youth, andethereal light. This is not European conception of highest godhead,but, once religious background is understood, even European canrecognize in finest specimens of dancing Śiva true religiousinspiration, wholly successful effort at depicting in plastic terms divinetruth, beauty and joy.

An important school of bronze casting existed in Ceylon, and produced works similar in style to those of South India. finest metal product of Ceylon is undoubtedly lovely large figure of goddess, generally believed to be that of Buddhist Tara, but perhaps Parvatl, wife of Śiva (pl. LXV). This lovely and delicate casting, now in British Museum, cn hold its own with greatest products of South Indian bronzesmith.

Nearly all Indian bronzes were made by “cire perdue” process. figure was first designed in wax, which was covered with coating of clay.

The whole was then heated, so that wax melted away, leaving mould to be filled with molten metal. Larger standing figures, such as Sultanganj Buddha, which weighs nearly ton, were often made in two parts which were then welded together.



## PAINTING
Literary references alone would prove that painting was very highly developed art in ancient India. Palaces and homes of rich were adorned with beautiful murals, and smaller paintings were made on prepared boards. Not only were there professional artists, but many men and women of educated classes could ably handle brush.

Though now all in very bad condition surviving remains of ancient Indian painting r sufficient to show its achievement. They consist almost entirely of murals in certain of cave temples. No doubt most templeswere painted in some way, and statuary was brightly coloured, as itoften is in Hindu temples today, and here and there more elaborate schemesof mural decoration were carried out. few caves in outlying placescontain rough painted sketches of no special merit, often primitive in style,and believed by many authorities to be prehistoric. Some of artificialcaves dedicated to religious purposes, however, give us samples of workof highly developed schools of painting, and few would dispute that themurals [Page 377] of Ajanta r among greatest surviving paintings ofany ancient civilization.

PLATE LXXI


Fogg Museum of Art, Harvard University
Avalokitesvara-Padmapani. Mural painting, Ajantā. Gupta Period.

## PLATE LXXII
The cave paintings of Ajanta (pls. LXXII-IX) r often referred to as frescos, but this term is incorrect, for fresco is painted while plaster isstill damp, and murals of Ajanta were made after it had set. wallswere first covered with coating of clay or cowdung bound together withstraw or hair, and then finished with white gypsum. Considering climatethe surface has stood well, but in many places it has flaked away, and evensince they were first copied in last century condition of paintingshas deteriorated. pigments, on other hand, r still remarkablyfresh; in their original state paintings must hv been of great brilliance,and their colours r even now clear and well contrasted. artists workedin dim caves by light reflected from outside by metal mirrors.

The paintings in Cave X hv been shown with fair certainty to date from before beginning of Christian era, while those of Caves I and XVIare from perhaps as much as six centuries later. earlier paintings aremore sharply outlined and later show more careful modelling, but thereis no good evidence of progressively developing style, as in contemporarysculpture, and differences may be accounted for by personal stylesof craftsmen who supervised work in respective caves. Themurals chiefly depict scenes from life of Buddha and Jatakas. Noframe divides one scene from next, but they blend one into other, theminor figures and pattern skilfully leading eye to central figuresof each scene. There is no perspective, but an illusion of depth is given byplacing background figures somewhat above those in foreground.

The effect of this convention is rather like that of photograph taken with telescopic camera, and makes figures stand out from flat wall as though coming to meet observer.

Though painted for religious purposes murals of Ajanta bear rather asecular than religious message. Here, even more vividly than at Sānchī,we see whole life of ancient India in panorama. Here r princes in theirpalaces, ladies in their harems, coolies with loads slung over theirshoulders, beggars, peasants and ascetics, together with all many beastsand birds and flowers of India, in fact whole life of times,perpetuated on dim walls of caves by loving hands of manycraftsmen. Everything is gracefully and masterfully drawn and delicatelymodelled.

Among many masterpieces of Ajanta we must mention figure of handsome young man, his body bent slightly in pose [Page 378] called tribhahga, loved by Indian sculptors and artists, with jewelled crown on his head, and white lotus in his right hand. His smooth features betray gentle sorrow, and his eyes look downwards compassionately, as if at something far below him (pls. LXXII-III). Around him r apsarases, orheavenly damsels, and divine minstrels, all much smaller than centralfigure, who is Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara Padmapani, Lord whoLooks Down in Compassion (p. 276). Here, once more, work of deepreligious feeling appears among cheerfully sensuous scenes of everydaylife. Bodhisattva, for all his jewels and his smooth youthfulness, hasshared sorrows of world; his gentle eyes hv seen countless ages ofpain, and his delicately formed lips hv spoken words of consolation tocountless sufferers. artist of Bodhisattva has conveyed his message-the universe is not indifferent to sorrows and strivings of its creatures.

Religious feeling of different type is found in painting of glorified Buddha, begging his daily bread from woman and child believed to represent his wife Yasodhara and his son Rahula. lovely portrayal of two minor figures is scarcely noticed against majesty of Master, whose calm features and robed body convey, like Sarnath Buddha, serenity of self-transcendence (pl. LXXV).

A few other paintings r to be found elsewhere. Those on walls ofthe veranda of cave at Bagh, some hundred miles to North of Ajanta,depict procession of elephants, perhaps more impressive in compositionthan anything Ajanta has to offer (pl. LXXX), and lovely scene of adancer and women musicians ( frontispiece). Traces of paintings in theAjanta style r to be found in other Deccan caves, notably at Badami andEllorā. Further south, in Tamil country, Jaina cave at place calledSātannavasal has yielded fine, though much decayed, mural.

Some of best preserved paintings of these schools r to be found in Ceylon. In centre of island great rock, Sigiriya, “Lion Mountain”, rises sharply for 600 feet above surrounding plain. Here, at end of 5th century, parricide king Kasyapa I built palace and fortress. Kāśyapa, evidently megalomaniac, was so convinced of his owndivinity that he tried to identify his rock-fortress with heaven, and haddemigods and heavenly beings painted on bare walls of rock, toshow his subjects that he transcended dm all. Nearly all these paintingshave vanished under hot sun and driving monsoon rain, but half way upthe rock face, preserved by an overhanging ledge, r figures oftwentyone apsarases immersed from their hips downwards in banks of[Page 379] cloud.6 These charming ladies, toying with flowers in languidposes (pl. LXXXIII), r so freshly preserved that one cn hardly believethat they were painted 1,500 years ago.

The surviving traces of medieval Hindu painting, at Tanjore,Vijayanagara, Polonnaruva in Ceylon, and elsewhere, indicate that therewas some technical decline after 8th century. Outlines become sharper,and delicate modelling of earlier period is lacking, but theachievement is still considerable. Scarcely anything survives from thisperiod in good enough preservation to make satisfactory reproduction, butwhat cn still be seen shows that tradition of mural painting continueddown to Muslim invasion.

After spread of Islamic influence Indian painter turned hisattention mainly to miniatures and book illustration, deriving muchinspiration from Persian models. Literary evidence shows that miniaturepainting existed long before coming of Muslims, however, and fewexamples hv survived from 11th and 12th centuries from Bihār,Bengal and Nepal (pl. LXXXIIa). These little pictures show great delicacyand skill, but they lack comparative realism of Ajanta, and figuresare almost unmodelled. They r products of formalized Buddhism,the religious inspiration of which was languishing, and which was largelydetached from contact with everyday life. Unlike Ajanta murals, theyare probably work of monks, and not of secular craftsmen.

The dry sands of Central Asia hv preserved paintings which, though not strictly Indian, owe much to Indian inspiration. earliest of these surround colossal rock-cut Buddha at Bāmiyān in Afghanistan (pl.

LXXXI) and r older than most of paintings at Ajantā. many murals and paintings on boards found at sites in Chinese Turkistan and other parts of Central Asia r mostly somewhat later, and show greater deviation from Indian models, though their debt to India is quite evident.

They date from period when trade route to China was wide open, and give proof of debt which Chinese art, despite its very individual character, owes to India,.

## MINOR ARTS
The excavations at Taksaśilā and other sites of North-West haverevealed fine jewellery (pl. LXXXIIb), with semi-precious [Page 380]stones set in gold filigree, much in manner of Indian jewellery of thepresent day. Bīmārān Casket (pl. LXXXVIIa), and few other objectsin gold and silver, r delicately worked, as r crystal relic casketsfound in Buddhist sites in many parts of India. Engraved intaglio gems fromthe North-Western sites r usually of no great artistic merit, and nearly allthese small objects of art show influence of western models, while somemay well hv been imported.

Though little survives, much beautiful work was done in ivory. Guilds of ivory carvers r mentioned in inscriptions and their profession wasevidently well-patronized and honourable one. Of surviving ivory workthe most interesting if not most beautiful specimen is small statuette ofa goddess, found at Herculaneum (pl. LXXXVIIb), no doubt imported withspices and fine textiles via Egypt. More beautiful r ivory plaques,originally fastened to lids and sides of boxes, found at Kusāna site ofBegram, some fifty miles west of Kabul. Though discovered in regionmost open to Western influence, designs of these plaques r purelyIndian in inspiration, and they were either imported from India proper ormade by craftsmen who had learnt their trade from Indian masters (pl.

LXXXVIIc). figures r outlined with deep-cut lines, and, althoughonly lightly modelled, give wonderful impression of depth. Their delicacyand grace r unexcelled in any work of art of ancient India. art ofivory carving has continued down to present day both in India andCeylon (pl. LXXXVIII), but it has never again produced works as lovely asthese.

Since they delighted in minute detail and gave great care to finish of their productions it is surprising that Indians did not develop their coinage artistically. Ancient Indian coins r generally crude and ugly. Only under Gupta emperors did they approach status of works of art, and even Gupta gold coins r but works of art of second order. They

have originality and charm, however. Thus Candra Gupta I lovingly gazes at his chief queen, Kumāradevī; Samudra Gupta, enthroned, performs on harp; Candra Gupta II slays rhinoceros; and Kumāra Gupta I rides on splendid elephant (fig. xxive). After this, however, standard of coin production deteriorated rapidly, and medieval kings who patronized great artists and craftsmen were satisfied with coins of crudest type.

Exceptional r lovely large silver coins minted by Greek kings of Bactria, which bear some of finest numismatic portraits in world (pl.

LXXXIVa-c); but inspiration of these coins is purely Hellenistic, and they were no doubt designed by Greek [Page 381] craftsmen. It is unlikely that they circulated widely in India, where Greek kings issued cruder bilingual coins (pl. LXXXIVd), in style followed by later Sakas and Kusanas (pl. LXXXIVe).

## MUSIC
[Page 382] There is some evidence to show that Aryans knew theheptatonic scale, and instructions for intoning hymns of SāmaVeda show that style of liturgical singing in Vedic times was rather likethat of medieval plain chant, and has been preserved fairly accurately by thebrāhmans down to present day. Between this and early centuries ofthe Christian era we hv little knowledge of progress of Indian music,but in latter period an anonymous writer composed textbook ondrama, music and dancing, which, in accordance with custom of thetime, he attributed to ancient sage Bharata, and which has survived tothis day. Bharata Nātyaśāstra is our earliest Indian authority on thesethree arts, and shows that by this time India had fully developed system ofmusic, which differed little from that of present-day Indian “classical”music. Anyone who has heard performance on vīnā by good SouthIndian musician has probably heard music much as it was played over athousand years ago. For this reason, and because of highly technicalnature of subject, we treat ancient Indian music briefly.

The basic scale is heptatonic, its seven notes 7 correspondingapproximately to those of European major scale. They may beelaborated with half-tones or quarter-tones ( Sruti). There r twenty-twoquarter-tones in octave, which occur in following order:From this diagram it will be seen that notes sa, ma and pa(approximately European do, fa and so) may hv as many as threedegrees of sharpness. quarter-tones of Indian music r chieflynoticeable in ornamentation, when they r used with striking effect, butthey also occur to some extent in melody, so that untutored Westernermay well think that singer or musician is out of tune.

As well as scale based on note sa, corresponding to European major, other scales may be based on other notes of seven, thus resembling modes of ecclesiastical music.
Besides grāma, which we hv translated “scale”, there r otherbasic classifications of tune-types, chief of which is raga. raga is aseries of five or more notes, upon which melody is based. Over thirtyragas r mentioned in Bhārata Nātyaśāstra, and [Page 383] total has since grown considerably until now hundreds hv been enumerated.

According to orthodox theory there r six basic ragas, others being rdginzs, personified as wives of masculine ragas. six originalragas r variously given, oldest list, that of Bharata, being as follows:The ragas r classified acc to time of day or night for whichthey r most appropriate. Thus, of examples above, Bhairava issuitable for performance at dawn, Megha in morning, Dipaka andSriraga in afternoon, and Kausika and Hindola at night. Bhairava isassociated with awe and fear, Kauśika with joy and laughter, Hindola,Dipaka and Śrīrāga with love, and Megha with peace and calm. It isinteresting that raga most closely corresponding to European majorscale, Pañcama, is associated with night and love in Indian system.

There is no harmony in Indian music, and melody, which usually proceeds by conjunct intervals (i.e. adjacent notes on keyboard), never suggests harmonic basis, as do many European melodies. tune issustained by drone note and by drumming. subtle and complex crossrhythms of Indian music take place of harmony and counterpoint in theear of trained listener. Like ancient Greeks Indians delighted andstill delight in unusual times, such as and. tala, or rhythmic figure is,after raga, most important element of Indian music. Bharatarecognizes twenty-two talas, and since then many more hv beenintroduced. Talas range in complexity from simple 2time ( aditala) and(rupaka, stressed as) to such remarkable rhythms as jhampa, rhythm stressed:
or atā, which has fourteen notes to bar, thus: When two or more of these complex rhythms, each ornamented with grace notes and varied by syncopation, r sounded together, result is rhythmic texture nearly as difficult for European to disentangle as four- part fugue would be to an Indian.

The Indian musician was, and still is, an improviser. While simple melody could be recorded in alphabetic notation India never [Page 384] devised true musical notation and music of her ancient masters has vanished for ever. As at present day, every performance was virtually new composition. musician would choose his raga and tāla and, often starting from well-known melody, would elaborate his theme in form of free variations, working up to climax of complex and rapid kkornamentation.

The chief musical instrument was vna, usually loosely translated “lute”. term was originally applied to bow-harp, often with ten strings, of type very similar to small harp used in ancient Egypt and early civilizations of Middle East (pl. XXXVIIb). By end of Gupta period this instrument had begun to go out of fashion, and its place was largely taken by lute with pear-shaped body, played either with fingers or with plectrum. This in turn was superseded in 8th century by early form of modern vīnā, with long finger-board and small round body, often made of dried gourd. Bowed instruments may hv been known, but seem to hv been little used in polite circles until thecoming of Muslims. Flutes and reedinstruments of various kinds werewidely played, but instruments of trumpet type were rarely used exceptas signals. Of these most mentioned was conch, shell of largemollusc, blown through its sawn-off point before battle, as an invocation toa deity, and on important occasions generally; its sound was veryauspicious. Percussion instruments were numerous and varied. smallerdrums, played in pairs with fingers as at present, were looked on asalmost essential for any musical performance. Larger drums were used forstate occasions, and there was wide range of cymbals, gongs and bells.

The evidence of Bharata shows that, as at present day, Indian of two thousand years ago preferred throaty, rather nasal type of singing, which comes more naturally than that which Europe has learnt to appreciate. singing voice was often treated as musical instrument, vocalist performing long impromptu variations on simple melody, sung to single phrase, often an invocation to deity.

In late medieval period music became largely preserve of professionals, who, though much in demand by well-to-do people who employed them, were of low caste. This was not case in India’s greatest days, when knowledge of music was looked on as an essential attribute of gentleman. “The man who knows nothing of literature, music or art,” runs an ancient Indian proverb, “is nothing but beast without beast’s tail and horns “.

## DANCE
[Page 385] Like music, Indian dancing has changed little with centuries, and best modern Indian dancers, such as Uday Shankar and Ram Gopal, still dance acc to rules of Bhdrata Nātyaśāstra.

Dancing ( nrtya) was closely connected with acting (nj.tya); in fact both r forms of same word, latter being Prakritism, and aspects of single art, abhinaya, portrayal of eight emotions (p. 417). dramaemployed chiefly word and gesture, dance chiefly music and gesture. Asin most other civilizations there is little doubt that Indian drama, whichwe consider in following chapter, developed from ritual miming songand dance.

Indian dancing is not merely thing of legs and arms alone, but of thewhole body. Every movement of little finger or eyebrow issignificant, and must be fully controlled. poses and gestures areclassified in detail, even as early as Bhdrata Nātyaśāstra, whichmentions thirteen poses of head, thirty-six of eyes, nine of neck,thirty-seven of hand, and ten postures of body. Later texts classifymany more poses and gestures, every one of which depicts specificemotion or object. With so many possible combinations dancer cn tell awhole story, easily comprehensible to observer who knows theconvention.

The most striking feature of Indian dance is undoubtedly hand-gesture ( mudra). By beautiful and complicated code, hand alone iscapable of portraying not only wide range of emotions, but gods, animals,men, natural scenery, actions and so on. Some hundreds of mudras areclassified in later textbooks, and they r used not only in dance, but, aswe hv seen, in religious worship and iconography.
This highly developed dance style demanded years of training, and was
probably always chiefly performed by professionals, though there are
references in literature to princes and their ladies dancing in their palaces.

Ancient India was rich in folk-dances, which were performed at festivals. In later years only low caste people would think of dancing in public, but there seems to hv been no social taboo on art in ancient times, except perhaps for practising brahmans.

1 It has been suggested that stūpa, like later Hindu temple, was thought of as microcosm of universe. There r Mesopotamian precedents for this belief, and passion for cosmic symbolism, evident in India from Vedic times, certainly led to making of analogy at least in respect of temple.2 But, though many authorities would disagree with us, we do not believe that cosmic symbolism played any great part in thought of ancient Indian architect.

2 kirtimukha is found in other South Indian schools as decorative motif, especially in makara-torana, gateway with large kirtimukha mask above lintel connected by foliate designs to two makaras or sea- monsters at base of doorposts. These motifs were exported to South- East Asia and became regular features of Indonesian and Cambodian architecture.

3 Often referred to by modern vernacular names, bhog ma.dir, nat ma.dir, jagmohan, and deul respectively.

4 tribhanga, pose in dancing and dramatics with one leg bent and body slightly turned at hips, was favourite with sculptor from earliest times. It contrasts sharply with hieratic poses of most ancient art other than that of Greeks, and gives an impression of life and vitality.

5 Said by some to be an exceptional Pala production. 10 6 Until recently these figures were thought to be portraits of Kāśyapa’s queens and concubines, and some of faces seem to show individual character. Some authorities might still support older theory, but context of paintings leaves little doubt that above interpretation is correct.

## LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
I. LANGUAGE
[Page 386]
## Sanskrit
IT has long been universally accepted that Sanskrit is remote cousin of all languages of Europe, with exception of Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, Turkish and Basque. All other European tongues look back to common ancestor in group of dialects spoken by tribesmen in steppelands of South Russia some 2,000 years B.C. relationship of Sanskrit to languages of West is indicated by several obviousresemblances, such as pitr, “father”, and mātr, “mother”, and many otherswhich r less obvious. For instance Sanskrit ivan, “dog”, is cognatewith Greek, Latin canis, German Hund, and Englishhound, Germanic h representing an original k. Sanskrit cakra isrelated to word with same meaning in English, wheel, both of whichoriginated from word pronounced something like kwekulo, which wasalso ancestor of Greekand Old English hweogol, fromwhich our word “wheel” is derived. Many hundreds of relationships of thiskind, at first not obvious, hv been established with virtual certainty.The reader with slight knowledge of Latin or Greek will immediatelyrecognize relationship between their verbal systems and that of Sanskrit.Thus present tense of Sanskrit verb as “to be”, is declined in singularand plural as follows:asmi, “I am”; smas, “we are”;asi, “thou art”; stha, “you are”;asti, “he is”;santi, “they are”.Vedic Sanskrit is in many ways closer than any other Indo-Europeanlanguage to parent tongue, and it was discovery of Sanskrit whichenabled Bopp, Rask, and other scholars of first half of last century toestablish clear relationship between languages of Indo-Europeangroup and to develop science of comparative philology.The earliest surviving form of Sanskrit,thatoftheṚgVeda,bearsaboutthe same relation to classical tongue as does Homeric to classical Greek.At all its stages Sanskrit is languageofmanyinflexions,buttheVedascontainnumerousformswhich[Page 387] later went out of use. verb isof complexity rivalling Greek, with bewildering array of voices andmoods, later much simplified. Vedic noun, as in later Sanskrit, haseight cases, and both verb and noun hv dual numbers.An important feature of Vedic Sanskrit is tonic accent. Everyimportant word had an accented syllable, which was not necessarilystressed, but on which voice rose in pitch, as in classical Greek. Thetonic accent of Sanskrit word, is, with exceptions due to special rulesof languages, same as in cognate Greek word.Sanskrit, and most of languages derived from it, r characterized bythe presence of aspirated consonants. Thus k, pronounced withoutappreciable emission of breath, is, to Indian, quite different soundfrom aspirated kh, which is pronounced with strong breathing, ratherlike first sound of English word come. To average European, thedifference is hardly noticeable. distinction goes back to Indo-Europeans, and was made in classical Greek, though in Greek aspirateletters 0, 9 and X had lost their original pronunciation before beginningof Christian era. Another phonetic characteristic of Vedic Sanskrit, alsosurviving to modern times, is series of “retroflex” or “cerebral”consonants, t, th, d,.dh, and n. These, to Indian, r quite different fromthe “dentals”, t, th, etc., though European finds dm hard to distinguishwithout practice. retroflex sounds r not Indo-European, and wereborrowed very early from indigenous inhabitants of India, either proto-Australoid or Dravidian. further feature of phonetics of Sanskrit is thepredominance of vowels and a. Vedic is fine language, capable ofvigorous and noble expression. On p. 509 we quote two verses of Vedic5hymns in original, which will give reader some idea of sound ofthe language.5After composition of Ṛ g Veda Sanskrit developed considerably. Inthe early centuries of 1st millennium B.C. old inflexions disappeared, andthe grammar was somewhat simplified, though still remaining verycomplex. New words, mostly borrowed from non-Āryan sources, wereintroduced, while old words were forgotten, or lost their original meanings.In these circumstances doubts arose as to true pronunciation and5meaning of older Vedic texts, though it was generally thought thatunless they were recited with complete accuracy they would hv nomagical effectiveness, but bring ruin on reciter. Out of need topreserve purity of Vedas India developed sciences of phoneticsand grammar. oldest Indian linguistic text, Yaska’s Nirukta, explainingobsolete Vedic words, dates from 5th century B.C., and followed [Page388] much earlier work in linguistic field. Pānini’s great grammar, theAstāhyayī ( “Eight Chapters” ) was probably composed towards end ofthe 4th century B.C. With Panini language had virtually reached itsclassical form, and it developed little thenceforward, except in itsvocabulary.By this time sounds of Sanskrit had been analysed with an accuracynever again reached in linguistic study until 19th century. One ofancient India’s greatest achievements is her remarkable alphabet,commencing with vowels and followed by consonants, all classifiedvery scientifically acc to their mode of production, in sharp contrastto haphazard and inadequate Roman alphabet, which has developedorganically for three millennia. It was only on discovery of Sanskrit bythe West that science of phonetics arose in Europe.

The great grammar of Panini, which effectively stabilized Sanskritlanguage, presupposes work of many earlier grammarians. These hadsucceeded in recognizing root as basic element of word, and hadclassified some 2,000 monosyllabic roots which, with addition ofprefixes, suffixes and inflexions, were thought to provide all words ofthe language. Though early etymologists were correct in principle, theymade many errors and false derivations, and started precedent whichproduced interesting results in many branches of Indian thought ( p. 82).

Though its fame is much restricted by its specialized nature, there is no doubt that Panini’s grammar is one of greatest intellectual achievements of any ancient civilization, and most detailed and scientific grammarcomposed before 19th century in any part of world. workconsists of over 4,000 grammatical rules, couched in sort of shorthand,which employs single letters or syllables for names of cases, moods,persons, tenses, etc. in which linguistic phenomena r classified. greatterseness of Panini’s system makes his work very difficult to follow withoutpreliminary study and suitable commentary. Later Indian grammars aremostly commentaries on Panini, chief being “Great Commentary”( Mahābhāsya) of Patañjali ( 2nd century B.C. ) and “BanarasCommentary” ( Kāśikā Vrtti) of Jayaditya and Vamana ( 7th century A.D. ).

Some later grammarians disagreed with Panini on minor points, but hisgrammar was so widely accepted that no writer or speaker of Sanskrit incourtly or brahmanic circles dared seriously infringe it. With Panini thelanguage was fixed, and could only develop within framework of hisrules. It was from time of Pānini onwards that language began to becalled Samskrta, “perfected” or [Page 389] “refined”, as opposed to thePrākrtas (“unrefined”), popular dialects which had developed naturally.

Paninian Sanskrit, though simpler than Vedic, is still very complicatedlanguage. Every beginner finds great difficulty in surmounting Panini’srules of euphonic combination ( sandhi), elaboration of tendenciespresent in language even in Vedic times. Every word of sentence isaffected by its neighbours. Thus na-avadat ( “he did not say” ) becomesnāvadat, but na-uvāca ( with same meaning) becomes novāca; Rdmas-uvāca ( “Rāma said” ) becomes Rama uvāca, and Rimas-avadat becomesRamo ‘vadat, but Harisavadat ( “Hari said” ) becomes Harir avadat. Thereare many rules of this kind, which were even artificially imposed on Ṛ gVeda, so that reader must often disentangle original words to find thecorrect metre.

Panini, in standardizing Sanskrit, probably based his work on thelanguage as it was spoken in North-West. Already lingua franca ofthe priestly class, it gradually became that of governing class also. TheMauryas, and most Indian dynasties until Guptas, used Prākrit for theirofficial pronouncements. first important dynasty to use Sanskrit wasthat of Sakas of Ujjain, and inscription of Rudradaman at Girnar ( p.62) is earliest written Sanskrit document we possess, with exceptionof few inscriptions which r brief and unimportant.

As long as it is spoken and written language tends to develop, and itsdevelopment is generally in direction of simplicity. Owing to theauthority of Panini, Sanskrit could not develop freely in this way. Some ofhis minor rules, such as those relating to use of tenses indicating pasttime, were quietly ignored, and writers took to using imperfect, perfect andaorist indiscriminately; but Panini’s rules of inflexion had to be maintained.The only way in which Sanskrit could develop away from inflexion was bybuilding up compound nouns to take place of clauses of thesentence.

In Vedic and Epic literature compound nouns r common enough,but they r usually of only two or three members, like English“houseboat”, or “blackbird”. In classical Sanskrit, on other hand, theymay hv as many as twenty or thirty members. Earlier classical poets suchas Kālidasā r comparatively restrained in their use of compounds, thougheven in poetry compounds of six elements r not uncommon; but theearliest royal panegyrics in Sanskrit employ enormous compounds. Forinstance emperor Samudra Gupta is referred to as “binding together thewhole world by putting forth his strength and by [accepting] acts of service[from other kings], such as paying personal homage, presentation of[Page 390] gifts of maidens, and soliciting his charter, sealed with theGarudaseal, to confirm dm in possession of their territories” in singleword of twenty components. 1 This remarkable use of long compounds maybe due to influence of Dravidian speech on language, for early Tamilhas few inflexions, and its words r put together in concatenations withoutdefinite indication of their relationship. If components of Sanskritcompound word r thought of as separate words, as in such an Englishphrase as “my top righthand waistcoat pocket” which in Sanskrit would betreated as single compound word, new constructions of classicalperiod become intelligible.

With growth of long compounds Sanskrit also developed taste for long sentences. prose works of Bāna and Subandhu, written in 7th century, and writings of many of their successors, contain single sentences covering two or three pages of type. To add to these difficulties writers adopted every conceivable verbal trick, until Sanskrit literature became one of most ornate and artificial in world.

The interest in language which India had shown from earliest times continued in medieval period. number of valuable “dictionaries” survive from this time; these r not comparable to alphabetically arranged dictionaries of West, but rather to such works as Roget’s


Thesaurus. They contain lists of words of approximately same meaningor used in similar contexts, sometimes with brief definitions, wholearranged in simple verse. most famous lexicographer, and earliestwhose work has survived, was Amarasimha, by tradition contemporary ofKālidāsa. Another form of dictionary, more akin to our own, was list ofhomonyms, classifying words with more than one meaning.

Indian interest in language spread to philosophy, and there wasconsiderable speculation about relations of word and thing itrepresented. Mīmāmsā school ( p. 327), reviving verbal mysticismof later Vedic period, maintained that every word was reflexion ofan eternal prototype, and that its meaning was eternal and inherent in it. Itsopponents, especially logical school of Nyaya ( p. 323), supported theview that relation of word and meaning was purely conventional. Thusthe controversy was similar to that between Realists and Nominalists inmedieval Europe.

Classical Sanskrit was probably never spoken by masses, but it was
never wholly dead language. As official tongue of church and state itwas read and spoken by upper classes, and probably [Page 391]understood to some extent by many of lower orders. It served as alingua franca for whole of India, and even today learned brāhmans fromthe opposite ends of land, meeting at place of pilgrimage, willconverse in Sanskrit and understand each other perfectly.

## Prākrit and Pali
The language of Ṛ g Veda was already rather archaic when hymns were composed, and ordinary Āryan tribesman spoke simpler tongue, more closely akin to classical Sanskrit. In Veda itself there is evidence of dialectal differences. By time of Buddha masses were speaking languages which were much simpler than Sanskrit. These were Prakrits, of which several dialects hv been attested.

The everyday speech of ancient India has been preserved for us largely through unorthodox religions, whose earliest scriptures were composed in languages approximating to those spoken by people. Most inscriptions of pre-Guptan times, notably great series of Aśokan edicts,are in Prakrits, and women and humbler characters of Sanskritdrama r made to speak in formalized Prakrit of various dialects. fewworks of secular literature were composed in Prākrit. Thus there is muchmaterial for reconstructing popular languages.

Prākrit were much simpler than Sanskrit both in sound and grammar.

Except for certain combinations which were easy to pronounce, such as doubled consonants, or compounds of which nasal letter was first member, groups of consonants were drastically simplified. Consonants at ends of words disappeared, and, in some dialects, even single consonants in middle of words were omitted. diphthongs ai and auof Sanskrit vanished, as did old vowels r and l, correct pronunciationof which was almost forgotten very early. In one dialect, Māgadhi, rregularly became l, giving lājā for rājā. rules of euphonic combinationwere practically ignored, and dual number disappeared, while theinflexions of noun and verb were much reduced.

One very important and early Prākrit was Pali, which became language of Sthaviravadin Buddhists. Buddha probably taught in Magadhl, but as his doctrines spread over India they were adapted to thelocal dialects. language chosen by Sthaviravadins was Westernone, probably spoken in region of Sānchī and Ujjayini. Pali, which isstill religious language of Buddhists of Ceylon, Burma and South-East Asia, seems to look back rather to Vedic than to classical Sanskrit.

[Page 392] Magadhl was official language of Mauryan court, and edicts of Aśoka were composed in it, though language in which they r inscribed in different parts of India is evidently affected by local vernaculars. later hybrid Māgadhī, somewhat influenced by Western Prākrit and usually known as Ardha-magadhi ( “Half Māgadhī” ), became sacred language of Jainas, and large literature is written in it.

Other important Prākrit were Śaurasenī, spoken originally in western part of modern Uttar Pradesh, and Māhārāstrī, spoken in north-western Deccan. Śaurasenī was particularly used in drama, for speech of women and respectable people of lower orders. Māhārāstrī was literarylanguage, especially popular for lyric song. There were several other Prākritof lesser importance. By time of Guptas Prākrit werestandardized and had lost their local character. vernaculars had alreadydeveloped beyond them. What Panini did for Sanskrit others did for thePrakrits, and they began to bear little resemblance to languages actuallyspoken. Dramatists, employing various Prākrit by convention, thought firstin Sanskrit, and produced their Prakrit passages by following mechanicallythe rules for conversion from one language to another as laid down by thegrammarians.

Another stage in development of Indo-Āryan language was Apabhramśa ( “falling away” ), vernacular of Western India which achieved literary form in Middle Ages and was used by Jaina writers in Gujarat and Rajasthan for composition of poetry. Its chief characteristicis further reduction of inflexions, which r in part replaced bypostpositions, as in modern Indian vernaculars. similar degenerate Prākritwas used in Bengal by few late Buddhist writers, and is ancestor ofmodern Bengali.

The next stage saw development of modern vernaculars of North India and is outside scope of this work, although earliest vernacular literature is little later than end of our period. One Indo-Āryanvernacular, however, had long history behind it by this time–this wasSinhalese, development of which cn be traced in inscriptions andliterature from 2nd century B.C. down to present day. prakriticdialect spoken by early settlers of Ceylon was already far removed fromthe original Sanskrit. Influenced by local speech, and also by Tamil,Sinhalese developed rapidly and independently. Very early aspiratedletters, characteristic of most Indo-Āryan languages, were forgotten. Vowelswere shortened, and short vowels e and o, absent in most Indo-Āryanlanguages, appeared, as well as wholly new vowel, a, rather like that inthe English hat. Many words were borrowed [Page 393] from theaboriginals and Tamils. By beginning of Christian era Sinhalesewas no longer Prakrit, but distinct language. Surviving Sinhaleseliterature dates from 9th century A.D., but it is certain that there wasmuch earlier work which is now lost.

## Dravidian Languages
While modern Indo-Āryan languages, with exception of Sinhalese, had not found literary expression at time of Muslim invasion, Dravidian languages had been flourishing for centuries.

Four of these tongues hv distinctive scripts and written literatures- Tamil, Canarese, Telugu and Malayalam. Of these Tamil is spoken in south, from Cape Comorin to Madras, Canarese in Mysore and parts of Hyderabad, Telugu from Madras northward to borders of Orissā and Malayalam in Malabar. Tamril is certainly oldest of these languages, with literature going back to early centuries A.D.

Some authorities believe that Dravidian languages r remotely affiliated to Finno-Ugrian group, which includes Finnish and Hungarian.2 If this is case it involves interesting corollaries concerning prehistoric race movements, but hypothesis is not absolutely certain.

Dravidian is virtually an independent group of languages with distinctivecharacter. Its sound system is rich in retroflex consonants, which give it acrisp flavour, and its varied vowels ( including e and o, not present inSanskrit) distinguish it from northern languages, where vowels anda predominate. Like Sanskrit it has complicated system of euphoniccombination. It does not recognize aspirated consonants of Indo-Aryanlanguages-by peculiar phonetic laws of Tamil, Sanskrit bhumi ( “earth” )becomes in Tamil pumi.

Tamil is not inflected, in sense that Sanskrit is, but relations of one word with another, and number, person and tense of verbs, r shown by suffixes, which may be piled up one upon another indefinitely.

Sanskrit began to affect language very early, and by Middle Ages
the learned looked on their suffixes as nominal and verbal endings, on theanalogy of Sanskrit. In oldest texts, however, these suffixes aresparingly used, and related words r juxtaposed in clusters, with few if anyindications of their relationship one to another-a system similar to greatcompound words of Sanskrit, and giving much difficulty to all but theexpert.

The earliest Tamil literature contains comparatively few Sanskrit loan- words, and those it does contain r generally adapted to Tamil phonetic system. gradual growth of Āryan influence resulted in borrowing ofmany more words in Middle Ages, [Page 394] often in their correctSanskrit form. Telugu and Canarese, which r spoken further north, arenaturally even more strongly influenced by Sanskrit. Canarese first appearsin inscriptions at end of 6th century, and its earliest surviving

literature goes back to 9th. Telugu does not appear as literary language until 12th century and only becomes really important under Vijayanagara Empire, of which it was court language. Malayalam, very closely akin to Tamil, became separate language in 11th century. 
## Writing
We hv seen that people of Harappā Culture had script, which cannot be deciphered. From time of fall of Harappa, perhaps about1550 B.C., to middle of 3rd century B.C. no Indian written materialhas survived. References to writing occur in Pali scriptures of theBuddhists, and in Sūtra literature, but there is no clear mention of it inthe Vedas, brāhmanas or Upanisads. This negative evidence, however, is notwholly conclusive, and some form of script may hv been used bymerchants. Aśokan inscriptions, which r earliest importantwritten documents of India, r engraved in scripts almost perfectly adaptedto expression of Indian sounds. It is generally thought that scriptshad many years, perhaps many centuries, of development before days ofAśoka.

The Aśokan edicts employ two scripts. most important, usedeverywhere in India except North-West, was Brāhmī, about origin ofwhich two theories exist. Most Indian authorities would now maintain thatthe script was derived from that of Harappa. Many Europeans and someIndians believe that it was derived from Semitic script. first theory,tentatively put forward by Sir Alexander Cunningham and elaborated by theAssyriologist Professor S. Langdon, 3 has many difficulties. Until we knowthe pronunciation of 270 Harappā signs we cannot be sure that thedozen or so letters of Brāhmī script which somewhat resemble dm arederived from them, and with so many Harappā signs it is unlikely that noresemblances at all should hv been found. Similarities between Brāhmīand some early North Semitic scripts r perhaps more striking, especiallyas latter offer only twenty-two letters to choose from, 4 but theresemblances r still not strong enough to be altogether convincing, andthe whole problem needs reopening.

Brāhmī ( fig. xxv) is normally read from left to right, as r European scripts, while Semitic scripts read from right to left. very defective series of Aśokan inscriptions at Yerragudi in [Page 396] Andhra, very early Sinhalese inscription, and an early coin from Eran in Madhya Pradesh, r read from right to left,5 which would suggest that this was original direction of Brāhmī. But this is no evidence of its origin, since it is believed that Harappā script was also read from right to left.

Thus speaks King, Dear to Gods, of Gracious Mien. When I had been consecrated twenty-six years I ordered this inscription of Law

( Dharma) to be engraved. Both this world and other r hard to reach, except by great Love of Law, great self-examination, great obedience ( to Law), great respect ( for Law), great energy. But through my leadership respect for Law and love of Law hv grown and will grow from day to day. Moreover my officers, of high, low and medium grades, follow it and apply it, sufficiently to make waverer accept it; officers on frontiers do likewise. For this is ( my) rule: government bythe Law, administration acc to Law, gratification ( of my subjects)by Law, protection by Law.

Whatever its ultimate origin Brāhmī is so skilfully adapted to sounds of Indian languages that its development must hv been at least in part deliberate. In form in which we hv it, it is work not of merchants but of brāhmans or other learned men who knew something of Vedic science of phonetics. It may hv begun as mercantile alphabet, suggested by shapes of Semitic letters, or by vague memories of Harappā script, but by time of Aśoka, though still not completely perfect, it was most scientific script of world.

The words of Semitic languages, based largely on roots of threeconsonants modified by internal vowel changes, needed few indications ofvowels to prevent ambiguity, and until comparatively late times vowelswere marked only at beginning of words, and then not perfectly. Greeks, when they borrowed Phoenician alphabet, adapted it to expressvowels other than by introduction of new signs. Indians, on theother hand, expressed their vowels by modification of basic letter,which was looked on as containing an inherent short a. Thus Brāhmīletter t is not k, but ka. Other vowels were indicated by ticks attached to thetop or bottom of letter, thus:;
.
Two consonants together were expressed by placing one under other;thus t ka and ya combined to form kya. No word in Prakrit ends with aconsonant, except with final m, which was expressed by dot, thus: t’kam. In writing Sanskrit, at later time, consonant ending sentence orline of poetry was marked by diagonal stroke thus W k. words of asentence were not generally divided, final letter of one being combinedwith initial letter of other; with some modification this is still thepractice in case of Sanskrit, though not of vernaculars, and adds tothe difficulties of language for beginner.

Local variations of Brāhmī script r evident even at time of Aśoka. In following centuries these differences developed further, until distinct alphabets evolved. Before beginning of Christian era engravers in north, no doubt following custom of scribes, began toadd little ticks ( called in European printing terminology serifs) to theletters, and to employ flourishes of various kinds. tendency toornamentation increased with centuries, until in late medieval periodthe serifs at tops of [Page 398] letters were joined together in an almostcontinuous line, to form Nāgarī ( “City” alphabet, also calledDevaNāgarī, “Script of City of Gods” ), in which Sanskrit, Prakrit,Hindi and Marathi r written at present day. Local variations led to thedevelopment of individual scripts in Panjāb, Bengal, Orissā, Gujarat andelsewhere.

- In year of Aya2 136, in month Aadha on 15th day. On this day relics of Lord ( Buddha) were deposited by Urasaka Bactrian, theson of Irptavhria, citizen of town of Noaca. These relics of Lordwere deposited by him in his own Bodhisattva chapel of Dharmarajika( Stupa) of Taksasila, for blessing of health for great King, Kingover Kings, Son of Gods, Kual}a, and in reverence to all theBuddhas, 3 in reverence to all Pratyeka Buddhas,t in reverence to theArhants.4 in reverence to all beings, in reverence to his mother and father,in reverence to his friends, his advisers, his kinsmen, and those of commonblood, and for boon of health and Nirvana for himself. May rightrenunciation be widespread.

- Meanwhile in Deccan scripts had been growing even more florid. InCentral India in 5th and 6th centuries script evolved which substitutedsquare boxes for serifs of northern scripts, and introduced severalother elaborations. scripts of Southern Deccan and Ceylon becamemore and more circular in form, until in Middle Ages theyapproximated to those of present day. Tamils, on other hand,evolved an angular script known as Grantha, which is still sometimes usedin Tamil country for writing Sanskrit, and from which modern Tamilalphabet is derived. Thus by end of our period alphabets of India differed little from those of today.

- It was from India, especially from south, that people of South- East Asia learnt art of writing. earliest surviving South-East Asian inscriptions, found in Borneo and Malaya, and dating from 4th or 5th centuries, r in fairly correct Sanskrit, and in script resembling that of theearly Pallavas. Though superficially very different, every South-East Asianscript, except of course Arabic and Roman scripts in which Malay iswritten, cn be traced back to Brāhmī. Scripts of Indian type hv been usedas far eastward as Philippine Islands.

- origin of other Aśokan script, called Kharosthī ( strange term, meaning “Ass-lip” ) ( fig. xxvi), is not in doubt. It was certainly derived from Aramaic alphabet, which was widely used in Achæmenid Persia, and was also known in North-West India. Many Kharosthī letters closely resemble Aramaic, and, like Aramaic, alphabet is read from right to left.

- Kharosthī was adapted to sounds of Indian languages by invention of new letters and use of vowel marks, which were lacking in Aramaic.

- It is generally thought that Kharosthī was adapted from Aramaic under theinfluence of Brāhmī, but priority of two scripts is not absolutelycertain. Kharosthī was little used in India proper after 3rd century A.D.,but it survived some centuries longer in Central Asia, where many Prakritdocuments in Kharosthī script hv been discovered. Later, Kharosthī wasreplaced in Central Asia by form of Gupta alphabet, from which thepresent-day script of Tibet is derived.

- usual writing material was leaf of talipot palm ( talapatra, in Tamil olai), dried, smoothed, sized and cut into strips. [Page 399] To form book number of such strips was held loosely together by cord passed through hole in centre of leaf, or, in case of large books, by twocords at either end. book was usually strengthened by wooden covers,which were often lacquered and painted ( pl. LXXXIIa). Palm leaves r stillsometimes used as writing material in outlying parts of South India. In Himalayan districts, where supplies of dried palm leaf were difficult toobtain, it was replaced by inner bark of birch tree, which, carefully pared and smoothed, served purpose excellently. As well as these materials, sized cotton and silk, and thin slips of wood or bamboo were also used, and important documents were engraved on copper plates ( pl. LXXXIX). Paper, traditionally invented in China in early.2nd century A.D., may hv been known in North India and it was certainly widely used in Central Asia. 6
- In most of India ink made from lampblack or charcoal, applied with reed pen, was usual writing medium. In South, however, letters were usually scratched on palm-leaf with stylus, and leaf then rubbed over with finely powdered lampblack. This system of writing gave letters fine sharp outline and allowed use of very small script; it probably encouraged development of angular forms of Tamil alphabet. 5

# II. LITERATURE
## Vedic Literature
We hv already dealt with Four Vedas, brāhmanas and Upanisads in many contexts, and hv given extracts from dm ( pp. 234– 56). In their literary aspect many of these scriptures r of high merit, especially some hymns of Ṛ g Veda and some parts of early Upanisads; much, on other hand, is dry and monotonous, or cn only be appreciated after considerable effort of imagination. 1028 hymns of Ṛ g Veda r work of many authors and show great variation of style and merit. Though their composition may hv covered as many as five centuries, even earliest of these poems is product of long tradition, composed acc to strict metrical scheme, 6 and settled literary convention.

The collection is divided into ten “circles” ( masala) or books. Of these, books ii to vii r ascribed to individual families of seers, and contain theearliest hymns; books i, viii, and x r later, especially [Page 400] parts ofx, while ninth book was compiled by extracting hymns to godSoma from other parts of Ṛ g Veda. hymns contain manyrepetitions and majority hv general sameness of outlook. Owing totheir archaic language and obscurity of their allusions many passagesare not fully understood. reader will already hv obtained some ideaof style of Ṛ g Veda, as far as it cn be conveyed in fairly literaltranslation, from passages we hv quoted. We add here few furthertranslations of hymns of special literary merit.

Our first translation describes Indra’s fight with cloud-dragon Vrtra.

The hymn evidently refers to well-known legend, which has since beenforgotten, but which was probably variant of creation myth ofMesopotamia, in which god Marduk slays demon of chaos, Tiamat,and creates universe. Here Indra’s function as rain-maker is also inevidence, and, if story was originally borrowed from Mesopotamia, ithad evidently developed far from its prototype. Interesting is fleetingreference to Indra’s fear, from which it would seem that his battle with thedragon did not go all his own way. last verse is evidently an addition by another hand.

“Let me proclaim valiant deeds of Indra,
the first he did, wielder of thunder,
when he slew dragon and let loose waters,
and pierced bellies of mountains.

“He slew dragon lying on mountain,
for Tvastr 7 made him heavenly thunderbolt.

The waters suddenly, like bellowing cattle,
descended and flowed on, down to ocean.

“In his strength he chose soma-
from three cups he drank essence.

The Generous seized his thunderbolt,
and smote firstborn of dragons.

“When, Indra, you slew firstborn of dragons,
and frustrated arts of sorcerers,
creating sun and heaven and dawn,
you found no enemy to withstand you.

“Indra slew Vrtra, and Vyamsa, stronger than Vrtra,
with his thunderbolt, with his mighty weapon.

Like branches of tree felled by axe
the dragon lay strewn over earth.

[Page 401] “Like an enraged coward he called challenge
to great hero, strong’s oppressor, charging.

But he did not escape force of his blows-
the foe of Indra crushed clouds together [in falling].

“Footless and handless, he still gave Indra battle,
until thunderbolt struck him hard on his back.

The bullock sought to be match for bull,
but Vrtra lay, his members scattered afar.

“The waters, flowing for man’s good, pass over him,
as he lies thus, broken like reed.

Beneath waters which he had encompassed
in his great might, Vrtra serpent lay.

“The strength of mother of Vrtra was exhausted,
and Indra bore away her weapon.

The mother lay above, son below.

Danu lay like cow beside her calf.

“Fallen in midst of water-courses,
never pausing, never resting,
floods overwhelm hidden corpse of Vrtra.

In long darkness lay foe of Indra.

“Lorded by Dāsas and guarded by dragon
the waters lay, penned in as cows by Pani.

When opening of waters was closed up
the slayer of Vrtra threw it open.

“O Indra, you became wreath of vapour, 8
when he impaled you on his lance. Alone
you won cows, hero, you won soma,
and you let loose Seven Streams to flow.

“Thunder and lightning availed him nothing,
nor mist he scattered abroad, nor hail.

When Indra and dragon fought he conquered,
as he, Generous, will in future conquer.

“And what avenger of dragon did you see,
Indra, as fear entered your heart when you had killed him,
when you crossed over nine and ninety streams,
as frightened hawk crosses skies?

“Indra is king of all that moves or rests,
of tame and fierce, wielder of thunder.

He is king of mortals, whom he rules,
encircling dm as wheel’s rim spokes.” 7
[Page 402] number of hymns show deep feeling for nature, most famous of these being hymns to Usas, goddess of dawn; but hymns to Usas r perhaps less beautiful than single hymn to Ratri, personified night.

“The goddess Night has looked abroad
with her eyes, everywhere drawing near.

She has put all her glories on.

“The immortal goddess now has filled
wide space, its depths and heights.

Her radiance drives out dark.

“Approaching, goddess has expelled
her sister Dawn.

Now darkness also disappears.

“And so you hv drawn near to us,
who at your coming hv come home,
as birds to their nest upon tree.

“The clans hv now gone home to rest,
home beasts, and home birds,
home even hawks who lust for prey.

“Guard us from she-wolf and wolf,
and guard us from thief, O Night,
and so be good for us to pass.

“For darkness, blotting out, has come
near me, black and palpable.

O Dawn, dispel it like my debts.

“I hv offered my hymn as cow
is offered, Daughter of Heaven. O Night,
accept it, as victor praise.” 8
Similarly sensitive to moods of nature is little hymn to Aranyani, elusive spirit of forest. 9
“Lady of Forest! Lady of Forest!

who seem to vanish from sight in distance,
why do you never come to village?

Surely you r not afraid of men!

[Page 403] “When grasshopper replies
to distant lowing of cattle,
as though to sound of tinkling bells
the Lady of Forest makes merry.

“Sometimes you catch glimpse of her, and think it is cattle grazing,
or house, far away,
and at evening you hear Lady of Forest
like distant sound of moving wagons.

“Her voice is as sound of man calling his cattle,
or as crash of felled tree.

If you stay in forest in evening,
you will hear her like far voice crying.

“But Lady of Forest will not slay
unless an enemy draws near.

She eats sweet wild fruits,
and then she rests wherever she will.

“Now I hv praised Lady of Forest,
who is perfumed with balm, and fragrant,
who is well fed, although she tills not,
the mother of all things of wild.” 9

A few Vedic hymns r by our standards primarily secular. Of these the“Gamester’s Lament” is most famous. Probably poem was originallya spell to ensure success in gaming, addressed to vibhidaka nutsthemselves. This was converted by an anonymous poet into cautionary poem, which obtained place in Ṛ g Veda on account of its reference tothe god Savitr as attempting to reform gamester.

“The dangling nuts, born where wind blows lofty tree,
delight me with their rolling on board.

The cheering vibhzdaka has brought me joy,
like draught of soma from Mount Mūjavant.

“She did not scold me, or lose her temper.

She was kind to my friends and me.

But because of throw too high by one
I hv rejected my loving wife.

“Her mother hates me; my wife repels me-
a man in trouble finds no one to pity him.

They say, ‘I’ve no more use for gambler
than for worn-out horse put up for sale.’
[Page 404] “When conquering die has got his possessions
others embrace gamester’s wife.

His father, his mother, his brothers say of him:
‘We don’t know him! Take him as bondman!’
“I think to myself: ‘I won’t go with others!

I’ll stop behind when my friends go to play!’
But then brown ones 10 raise their voices,
and off I go, like mistress to her lover.

“The gambler goes to hall of assembly.

‘Shall I win?’ he wonders. His body trembles.

The dice run counter to his hopes,
and give his opponent lucky throws.

“The dice r armed with hooks and piercing,
they r deceptive, hot and burning.

Like children they give and take again, they strike back at their
conquerors.

They r sweetened with honey through magic they work on the
gambler.

“They play in troop of three times fifty.

Like god Savitr, they r true to their laws.

They will not bend to wrath of mighty,
and even king bows low before them.

“The dice roll down, dice leap upwards,
unarmed they withstand man with arms.

They r heavenly coals, strewn over board,
and though they r cool they burn up heart.

“The forsaken wife of gambler sorrows,
and mother of son who wanders afar.

In debt, in fear, in need of money, 11
he goes by night to house of others.

“The gambler grieves when he sees woman,
another man’s wife, in their pleasant home.

In morning he yokes chestnut horses.12
In evening he falls by hearth, beggar.

[Page 405] “So to general of your great army,
to him who is king, chief of your host,
I say, stretching out to him my ten fingers:
‘I risk my all! I am speaking truth!’
“Don’t play with dice, but plough your furrow!

Delight in your property, prize it highly!

Look to your cattle and look to your wife,
you gambler!’ Thus noble Savitr tells me.

“So make friends with us, be kind to us!

Do not force us with your fierce magic!

May your wrath and hatred now come to rest!

May no man fall into snares of brown ones!” 10 We need say little here of later Vedic literature. Atharva Veda, in main monotonous collection of spells, contains few poems of great merit. prose brāhmanas and various recensions of Yajur Veda r in general without any pretensions to literary qualities, though written insimple straightforward language, very different in style from ClassicalSanskrit. Here and there legends r told in terse nervous prose, whichgains in effectiveness from its austere economy. We give story ofPurūravas and Urvaśī, which is told in Satapatha brāhmana as part ofthe instructions for becoming Gandharva ( p. 238) by means of magicalsacrifice. story is as old as Ṛ g Veda, for one hymn11 consists of adialogue between earthly lover and his heavenly mistress, from whichthe verses quoted in brāhmana version r taken. story was verypopular in later times, and was subject of one of Kālidasā’s plays.

“The nymph Urvasi loved Purūravas son of Idā. When she married him she said: ‘You must embrace me three times day, but never lie with me against my will. Moreover I must never see you naked, for this is proper way to behave to us women!’
“She lived with him long, and she was with child by him, so long did she live with him. Then Gandharvas said to one another: ‘This Urvasi hasbeen living too long among men! We must find way to get her back!’“She kept ewe with two lambs tied to her bed, and Gandharvascarried off one of lambs. ‘They’re taking away my baby,’ she cried, ‘asthough there were no warrior and no man in place!’ Then they tookaway second, and she cried out in same way.

“Then he thought to himself: ‘How cn place where I am be without warrior and man?’ And, naked as he was, he leapt up after them, for he thought it would take too long to put on garment.

[Page 406] “Then Gandharvas produced flash of lightning, and she saw him as clearly as if it were day-and she vanished … “Bitterly weeping, he wandered all over Kuruksetra. There is lake of lotuses there, called Anyatahplaksā. He walked on its banks, and there were nymphs swimming in it in form of swans.

“And she noticed him, and said: ‘That’s man with whom I lived!’
‘Let us show ourselves to him,’ they said. ‘Very well’ she replied, and they
appeared to him [in their true forms].

“Then he recognized her and entreated her:
‘0 my wife, with mind so cruel,
stay, let us talk together,
for if our secrets r untold
we shall hv no joy in days to come!’ …
“Then she replied:
‘What use is there in my talking to you!

I hv passed like first of dawns.

Puriiravas, go home again!

I am like wind, that cannot be caught.’…
“Mournfully Purūravas said:
‘Today your lover will perish,
he will go to furthest distance and never come back.

He will lie in lap of disaster,
and fierce wolves will devour him’. …
“She replied:
‘Pururavas do not die! do not go away!

do not let fierce wolves devour you!

Friendship is not to be found in women,
For they hv hearts like half-tamed jackals!’
“And then she said to him:
‘When I dwelt in disguise in land of mortals
and passed nights of four autumns,
I ate little ghee once day,
and now I hv had quite enough!’ …
“But her heart pitied him, and she said: ‘Come on last evening of the
year, then, when your son is born, you shall lie one night with me.’


“He came on last night of year, and there stood golden palace.

They told him to enter, and brought her to him.

“She said: ‘Tomorrow Gandharvas will grant you boon and you must make your choice’. He said: ‘You choose for me!’ She answered:
‘Say, “Let me become one of you!”’ “In morning Gandharvas gave him boon, and he asked: ‘Let mebecome one of you’.[Page 407] ‘There is no fire among men,’ they said,’ which is so holythat man may become one of us by sacrificing with it.’ So they put fire ina pan, and said: ‘By sacrificing with this you will become one of us.’“He took it and his son, andwent homeward. On way he left firein forest and went to village with boy. When he came back firehad vanished. In place of fire was pīpal tree and inplaceofthe pan amimosa. So he went back to Gandharvas.“They said: ‘For year you must cook rice enough for four [every day].Each time [you cook] you must put on fire three logs of pipalanointed with ghee … and fire which is produced [at end of theyear] will be fire [which will make you one of us]. But that is ratherdifficult,’ they added, ‘so you should make an upper firestick of pīpal woodand lower one of mimosa wood, and fire you get from dm will be thefire [which will make you one of us]. But that too is rather difficult,’ theyadded, ‘so you must make both upper and lower firestick of pīpal wood,and fire you get from dm will be fire.’“So he made an upper and lower firestick of pīpal wood, and fire hegot from dm was fire [which would make him one of them]. Hesacrificed with it andbecameaGandharva.”12TheUpanisadsrankhighasliterature, but their chief importance isreligious and they hv been sufficiently treated and quoted in that setting.Epic LiteratureThe earliest Indian literature of fundamentally secular character is thetwo great epics, Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana, which, though workedover by succession of priestly editors, give clear evidence of their originas martial legends. Their religious importance lay at first in royalsacrificial ritual, part of which involved telling stories of heroes of thepast. This put martial ballads into hands of priesthood, who, intransmitting them, often altered their superficial character, and interpolatedmany long passages on theology, morals and statecraft.Of two epics Mahābhārata is more important. It contains over 90,000 stanzas, usually of thirty-two syllables, and is therefore probably longest single poem in world’s literature. Traditionally author of poem was sage Vyasa, who is said to hv taught it to his pupil Vaiśampāyana. latter, acc to tradition, recited it in public for first time at great sacrifice held by King Janamejaya, great grandson of Arjuna, one of heroes of story. Stripped of its episodes and interpolations poem tells of great civil war in kingdom of Kurus, in region about modern Delhi, then known as Kuruksetra.[Page 408] throne of Kurus, whose capital was Hastinapura, fellto Dhrtarāstra. But he was blind and therefore, acc to custom, was noteligible to rule, so his younger brother Pāndu became king. Soon Pāndu, asa result of curse, gave up kingdom and retired to Himalayas as ahermit, with his two wives, leaving Dhrtarastra on throne. When Pāndudied, his five sons, Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, werestill children, and were taken back to Hastinapura to be educated with thehundred sons of Dhrtarāstra. When he came of age Yudhisthira wasconsecrated heir-apparent. But sons of Dhrtarastra, led by eldest,Duryodhana, resented Pāndavas, and plotted against them, though theywere not legally heirs to throne, owing to their father’s blindness and thestop-gap nature of his rule. After foiling number of plots against theirlives five brothers decided to leave country, and travelled from onecourt to another as soldiers of fortune. At court of king of thePañcālas Arjuna won Princess Draupadi in svayamvara, and, to avoidstrife, she became joint wife of all five brothers. Here they met theirgreat friend and helper, Krsna, chief of Yadavas. Soon after this theblind Dhrtarastra recalled them, renounced throne, and divided thekingdom between dm and his own sons. fivebrothersbuiltanewcapital at Indraprastha, not far from modern Delhi.But sons of Dhrtarastra were not content with this settlement.Duryodhana invited Yudhisthira to great gambling match. With aid ofhis uncle Śakuni, who knew all secrets of dice, he won fromYudhisthira his whole kingdom, including his brothers and their joint wife.A compromise was arranged, whereby five brothers and Draupadīagreed to go into banishment for thirteen years, spending last yearincognito, after which they were to receive back their kingdom.At end of thirteenth year they declared themselves, and sent toDuryodhana demanding their kingdom, acc to his promise; but hereturned no reply. So brothers prepared for war. They had many friendsamong kings of India, and were able to gather great army together.

Meanwhile Kauravas ( Duryodhana and his brothers) marshalled their own forces. kings of all India, and even Greeks, Bactrians andChinese, took sides with one or other faction, and two enormous armiesassembled on plain of Kuruksetra.

For eighteen days battle raged, until at last no important chief was leftalive but five brothers and Krsna. Yudhisthira was crowned king and formany years he and his brothers ruled peacefully and gloriously. At lastYudhishira renounced throne and installed Pariksit, grandson ofArjuna, in his place. With their joint wife five brothers set out on footfor Himalayas, where they climbed Mount Meru, and entered Cityof Gods.

If we ignore interpolations style of Mahābhārata is direct and vivid, though it contains many often repeated cliches and stock epithets, which r typical of traditional epic literature everywhere. chief characters r delineated in very simple outline, but [Page 409] with an individuality which makes dm real persons. blind Dhrtarastra is aweakling, anxious to do right thing, but easily persuaded to evil. Of thefive brothers eldest, Yudhisthira, is pious, righteous and gentle, but alittle negative in character; Arjuna is ideal knight, noble, generous andbrave; while Bhīma is rougher character, gluttonous and immenselystrong, but not very intelligent, and completely lacking in guile. Draupadi,their wife, is woman of spirit, who is not afraid to upbraid her fivehusbands on occasion. villain Duryodhana and his associates r notpainted in blackest of colours, but hv elements of nobility and couragein their characters.

Gupta PeriodPLATE LXXVIISome of interpolated episodes r of much merit, while others r ofno literary value. longest is Śānti Parvan, dissertation on statecraftand ethics, recited by Bhīsma, elder statesman of Kurus, as he liesdying on pile of arrows after great battle ( p. 80). This has been treatedelsewhere and has little merit as literature. Bhagavad Gitā, sermonof Krsna to Arjuna before great battle, has already been quoted ( pp. 301,34of). There r many other theological and ethical passages, as well asmany narrative episodes. Some of latter tell legends of gods, butothers r more or less secular, including famous stories of Rama andSītā ( p. 412f), Sakuntala ( p. 435f), and Sāvitrī ( p. 181). longestnarrative episode is story of Nala and Damayanti, told to Yudhisthiraduring his exile to convince him of evils of gambling. It tells how KingNala won Princess Damayanti at svayamvara, at which she chose him inpreference to gods themselves, and then lost both his queen and hiskingdom at gambling tournament, to regain dm after many excitingadventures. This long story is probably as ancient as main part of theepic, and is told in very simple verse. As brief example of theMahabharata’s narrative style we give description of Damayanti’schoice. Among suitors at svayamvara r four great gods, who,knowing that she is determined to choose Nala, hv all taken hisappearance, in hope that she will choose one of dm by mistake.

“Then, when right time had come, at auspicious day and hour, King Bhima invited lords of earth to bride-choice.

“When they heard, lords of earth, all sick at heart with love, in haste assembled, desiring Damayanti.

[Page 410] “Like great lions kings entered hall, firmly founded, with its splendid porch and shining golden columns.

“There on their several thrones lords of earth sat down all decked in fragrant garlands, with bright gems in their ears.

“Their arms were thick as iron bars, shapely and smooth as five-headed snakes.

“With lovely shining locks, and well-formed noses, eyes and brows, faces of kings were bright as stars in heaven.

“Then fair-faced Damayanti
entered hall,
stealing with her splendour
the eyes and thoughts of kings.

“When glance of noble
spectators fell on her limbs
there it was fixed,
and never wavered.

“Then, while names of kings
were being proclaimed,
the daughter of Bhima saw
five men of same form.

“Whichever of dm she looked at
she recognized as Nala.

Wondering in her mind,
the fair one was filled with doubt.

‘Of all signs of godhead
that I learned from elders
I see not even one
in those who r standing here.’
“Thus thinking over and over,
and pondering again and again,
she resolved that time had come
to take refuge in gods.

[Page 411] ‘I heard from mouth of swans
that Nala had chosen me as his bride,
and so, if that be true,
may gods show him to me!

‘Never in word or deed
have I committed sin,
and so, if that be true,
may gods show him to me!

‘The gods hv ordained king of Nisadha to be my lord,and so, if that be true,may gods show him to me!’‘May great gods, world-protectorstake on their own true form,that I may recognizethe king of men, of good fame!’“When they heard Damayanti,mournful and piteousthey did as she had asked,and put on their true forms.

“She saw four gods
sweatless, not blinking their eyelids,
their garlands fresh and free from dust,
not touching ground with their feet.

“But king of Nisadha had shadow,his garlands were withered,his body bore dust and sweat,and he blinked his eyelids.

“The modest long-eyed girl
seized hem of his garment,
and on his shoulder she placed
the loveliest of garlands.

“She chose him for her lord,
she of fair complexion,
and suddenly all kings
together shouted and cheered.

“And all gods and sages
thereupon cried bravo,
and shouted at wonder,
praising Nala king.” 13

[Page 412] second epic, Rāmāyana, is rather different from Mahābhārata in style and content. It is little more than one quarter of size of other epic, and of its seven books first and last r certainly later additions. poem, like Mahabharata, contains manyinterpolations, but they r much briefer and r mostly didactic. mainbody of poem gives impression of being work of single hand,that of poet whose style was based on that of other epic, but showedsome kinship to that of classical Sanskrit poetry.

Though Rāmāyana does not contain so many archaic features as Mahabharata, and gives general impression of being later of two, Mahābhārata contains as an episode story of Rāma, in form which suggests that editor of final version of Mahdbharata knew Rāmāyana. Mahdbharata as it is at present is probably later than Ramayana, but its main narrative portions r appreciably earlier.

The traditional author of Rāmāyana was sage Valmiki, contemporary of its hero. In fact legend was perhaps committed to verse in form in which we hv it, but excluding first and last books, little before commencement of Christian era. central scene of poem is Ayodhya, capital of old kingdom of Kosala, and it evidently grew up in milieu to east of that of Mahābhārata.

Dasaratha king of Kosala had four sons by his three wives; sons’names were Rāma, Bharata, Laksmana and Satrughna. four attendedthe court of King Janaka of Videha, where Rāma won hand of Janaka’sdaughter, Sītā, at great archery contest. Rāma and Sītā were married and for time lived happily at court of Dasaratha. ( In this part of story,contained in first book of epic, Rāma is explicitly described as anincarnation of god Visnu, and original text has evidently been muchadded to and altered at late period. )When Dasaratha grew old he named Rāma as his heir; but his secondqueen, Kaikeyī, reminded her lord of boon which he had promised herlong since, and demanded its fulfilment in banishment of Rāma and theinstallation of her own son, Bharata, as heir apparent. Dasaratha andBharata both demurred, but Rāma insisted on his father fulfilling hispromise, and went into voluntary exile with Sītā and his brother Laksmana.

When Dasaratha died Bharata took over kingdom, but only as regent for
the exiled Rama.

Meanwhile Rāma, Sītā and Laksmana dwelt as hermits in forest of Dandaka, where Rāma destroyed many demons who were harassing ascetics and villagers. Rāvana, demon king of Lankā ( Ceylon), decided to avenge his fallen kinsmen, and, while Rāma and Laksmana were on ahunting expedition, came to their hermitage in guise of an ascetic,seized [Page 413] Sita, and carried her off to Lankā in his aerial car( vimāna). brothers sought far and wide for Sītā, and enlisted help ofSugriva, king of monkeys, and his general, brave and loyalHanumant. Hanumant went in search of Sītā, and, leaping over straits, atlast found her in Rāvana’s palace. With aid of great army of monkeysand bears Rama built causeway of stones across sea to Lankā. After afierce battle Rāma, Laksmana and their allies slew Rāvana and his hosts,and rescued Sītā.

Sita had been treated with respect by her captor, and had in no wayyielded to his blandishments. But she had dwelt under roof of anotherman, and Rāma, in accordance with Sacred Law, could do nothing butrepudiate her. She threw herself on funeral pyre, but fire-god Agnirefused to accept her. After this proof of her innocence she was reunitedwith Rāma, and two returned to Ayodhya, where Bharata renounced thethrone and Rāma was crowned, to rule long and righteously.

The last book, certainly an addition, gives an unnecessary sequel to story, which was probably added on account of growing prejudice, and misgivings about Sītā’s lawful status after her unwilling residence in her captor’s house. people murmured because their queen had been forced to break her marriage vows, and suspicions as to her purity were notallayed, even by her ordeal by fire. Though he was quite convinced of herinnocence Rama, whose first duty was to “please people”, wasregretfully forced to banish her, and she took refuge in Valmiki’s hermitage,where she gave birth to twins, Kusa and Lava. Years later Rāma found Sītāagain, and acknowledged her sons. As final proof of her innocence shecalled on her mother, Earth, 13 to swallow her up. earth opened, andshe disappeared. Soon after this Rāma returned to heaven, and resumed theform of god Visnu. 14The style of Rdmdyana is less rugged than that of Mahābhārata.

The latter contains occasional grammatical and prosodical errors, theformer few if any. It is work of greater art, but less vigour, though itcontains many dramatic passages, and beautiful descriptive writing, whichthe Mahābhārata lacks. We give much abridged translation of thedescription of death of Rāvana, which is typical of treatment ofbattle in both epics.

“Then Rāma, reminded
by words of Matali,
took his flaming arrow
like hissing snake….

[Page 414] “He spoke mantra upon it
as Vedas ordain.

The strong one placed in his bow
that great and mighty arrow. …
“Enraged he fiercely bent
his bow against Rāvana,
and, intent on his mark, he shot
the entrail-tearing arrow. …
“Bearing death of body
the arrow flew with great speed,
and tore through heart
of evil-working Rāvana.

“Then, red with his blood and rapid,
that arrow, destroyer of bodies,
robbing life-breath of Rāvana,
drove into face of earth …
“Swiftly struck from his hand,
his bow and his arrow
dropped, with his life-breath,
upon ground.

“Unbreathing, with awful speed,
the glorious lord of demons
fell from his chariot to earth,
like Vrtra struck by thunderbolt. 15
“When they saw him fallen to earth
the remaining demons of night
in terror, their lord destroyed,
fled in every direction. …
“Falling, struck down by monkeys,
they fled to Lankā in terror,
their faces swimming in tears,
piteous at loss of their refuge.

“And in joy monkeys
roared cheer of triumph
and proclaimed victory of Rama,
and his slaying of Rāvana.

[Page 415] “In sky there sounded
the lovely drums of gods,
and there blew pleasant wind
bearing heavenly fragrance.

“A rain of flowers fell
from heaven upon earth,
flowers rare and lovely

bestrewing Rama’s chariot.” 14 epic style and metre became usual for didactic literature of all kinds.

Much of this, Puranas, Dharma Sastras, and other texts, has been referred to elsewhere. They contain passages of literary merit, but we must pass dm over for great body of courtly literature.

## Classical Sanskrit Poetry
The earliest surviving Sanskrit poetry in classical style is that of theBuddhist poet Asvaghosa, who is believed to hv lived at end of 1stcentury A.D., and who composed metrical life of Buddha( Buddhacarita) in comparatively simple classical style. GirnarInscription of Rudradaman, dated A.D. 150, is earliest surviving exampleof courtly Sanskrit prose. Thus courtly style is comparatively latedevelopment in Indian literature, although it must hv had long period ofevolution before dates which we hv mentioned.

On whole classical Sanskrit literature has not been well received in West. Though works of Kālidasā delighted Goethe, literature taken as whole has been called artificial, over-ornate, lacking in truefeeling, or even an example of wasted and perverted ingenuity. Indiansthemselves r not always satisfied with it. Thus modern authority writes:“As result of particular demand in court atmosphere naturalspontaneity of poet was at discount. … Learning and adaptation tocircumstances were given more importance than pure flow of genius. …As result Sanskrit poetry not only became artificial but followed atraditional scheme of description. … magic of Sanskrit language …also led poets astray and led dm to find their amusement in verbalsonorousness.”15This judgement, which author later qualifies, is in part correct. It is,besides, an indication of how deeply modern India has been affected byEuropean æsthetic standards, judged by which much Indian classicalliterature is indeed artificial. It was written mainly for recitation orperformance at court, or for comparatively small circles [Page 416] oflitterati, all well versed in rigid canons of literary convention andhighly appreciative of verbal ingenuity. In such circumstances it would befutile to expect native wood-notes of Clare or natural mysticism ofa Wordsworth. poets lived in comparatively static society, and theirlives were controlled in detail by body of social custom which wasalready ancient and which had sanction of religion behind it. They werenever in revolt against social system, and Indian Shelleys andSwinburnes r lacking. Most of this literature was written by men wellintegrated in their society and with few of complex psychologicaldifficulties of modern literary man; hence spiritual anguish of aCowper, heart-searchings of Donne, and social pessimism of anearly T. S. Eliot, r almost entirely absent. Despite its reputation forpessimism in West, Hindu thought and literature is fundamentallyoptimistic, and tragic drama, or story with an unhappy ending, wasnot looked on with favour.

The chief raw materials of Indian poet were love, nature, panegyric,moralizing and story telling. Religious subjects, in sense of legends ofthe gods, r common enough, but deep religious feeling is comparativelyrare in courtly literature. few poets, such as Bhartrhari, wroteoccasionally on religious themes with intensity of deep faith, but for allits mythological trappings and polite invocations to deities classicalSanskrit poetry is predominantly secular. gods, when they appear, haveusually character of enlarged human beings.

Love was passionately physical, and we hv said something of theapproach of Indian poet to subject in another chapter ( p. 17 If). As inmost European literature of ancient and medieval times, nature was usuallytreated in its relation to man, and rarely described for its own sake. Thephenomena of seasons, day and night, birds and beasts and flowers, areemployed to frame human emotions, or r personified as counterparts ofthe human subjects of poet. But throughout literature deep love ofnature is implicit, especially in Kālidasā who, for this reason among others,has higher reputation in West than any other ancient Indian poet.

Panegyrics, in praise of king and his ancestors, r very numerous andform one of chief sources of our historical knowledge. element ofmoralizing is prominent in writing of most poets. Kālidasā wasparticularly fond of including generalizations of sententious or moralnature in his verses, and this practice was recognized as one of thelegitimate alamkiras ( “adornments” ) of Sanskrit poetry. Gnomic verses,often of dry worldly-wise humour, were very popular.

The technique of poetry was thoroughly studied and rules were [Page417] laid down in numerous textbooks. purpose of poetry is usuallydescribed as emotive; emotion aroused, however, is not pity andterror of Aristotle, but calmer experience, an æsthetic sensation based onfeeling lifted to such plane that grief is no longer felt as grief, and love nolonger as love-according to one definition “impersonalized and ineffableæsthetic enjoyment from which every trace of its component … material isobliterated.”16 basic rasas or “flavours” from which this æstheticexperience should arise r usually classified as eight-love, courage,loathing, anger, mirth, terror, pity and surprise. Theoretically every poemshould contain one or more of these flavours.

An important element in Sanskrit poetic theory was dhvani
( “reverberation” ), suggestion or incantation of words and phrases.

Words hv their denotations and their connotations, their primarymeanings and their undertones, and it is with these latter that poet has todo. By carefully choosing his words he cn make dm say far more thantheir bare meanings and induce whole series of emotions by single briefverse. Indian literary philosophers advanced far in this direction andproduced theories on psychology of poetic appreciation which, in broadoutline, would not be inacceptable to many modern poets of West. 16Perhaps most important tool of poet was alamkāra, orornamentation, which included simile and metaphor, generalization,punning, alliteration of various kinds, and so on. This branch of poetictechnique was also worked out in great detail by theorists, and freeuse of ornamentation resulted in poetry of great floridity. This wasencouraged by enormous number of synonyms and homonyms inSanskrit, and by very numerous and universally accepted stock epithets,such as “the mine of jewels” ( ratnakara) for “the sea”, “the unmoving”( acala) for “mountain”, “sky-goer” ( khaga) for “bird”, and “the frail”( abala) for “woman”. ancient Indian poet would hv been quite athome with Pope’s “denizens of air” and “finny tribes”.

The unit of poetry is stanza, usually grammatically complete in itself.

The mahākāvya, loosely translated “epic”, often degenerated into string of verses or groups of verses, linked only by very slender thread of narrative.

In more ornate courtly literature plot and construction r in generalweak, and there is little sense of balance. This is not case with purelynarrative poetry, as in such works as “Ocean of Story”, author ofwhich tells his tales [Page 418] with economy and restraint ( p. 429ff). Andoften, even in most ornate kāvya, poet will from time to time rise tothe occasion with vivid and dramatic description, though it must beadmitted that longer Sanskrit poem is usually prolix and shapeless.

On other hand individual verse is balanced and succinct. Single- verse poems, reminiscent of Persian rubā’ī or Japanese tanka, were very popular, either standing alone or included in dramas and prose works.

Many of these r very beautiful, and make an immediate appeal to Western reader, even in translation. They were collected in anthologies, of which number survive and hv preserved many lovely verses which would otherwise hv been lost.

Metrically Sanskrit poetry was quantitative, and rigidly regulated. Thenormal stanza was one of four quarters, each of length varying from eight totwenty-one syllables, generally equal and unrhymed. Epics usuallyemployed metre called śloka, of eight syllables to quarter, whichallowed some scope for variation; but classical poets preferred metres ofgreater complexity and rigidity, of which many r listed in textbooks onpoetics, though only dozen or so were popular. These metres allowed littleor no scope for variation and their syllables were arranged in complicatedpatterns, usually of great beauty. 17Owing to structure of Sanskrit, literal translation of classical Indianpoetry into English is quite impossible, and we cannot convey æstheticeffect of Sanskrit verse. brief extracts here translated in rhythmicprose give but faint impression of rich and closely knit texture of theoriginals or of wonderful sonority of language, which, when wellhandled, with all arts of prosody and ornamentation, surely has asplendour unsurpassed by any other language in world. Classical Indianpoetry, like Indian music and art, developed along lines of its own and itscanons r not those of West, but it has its own special merits andbeauties.

Indian and European judges alike agree that Kālidasā was greatest Sanskrit poet. He probably flourished in reigns of emperors Candra Gupta II and Kumāra Gupta I ( 375–455), and thus saw ancient Indian courtly culture at its zenith. Like murals of Ajanta, his work seems toreflect that culture completely and convincingly. Though deeply imbued intradition, he carried tradition lightly, and throughout his work hispersonality breaks through. few legends r told of him in late sources,but we hv no reliable information about his life and character. From hiswork he seems to hv been happy and gentle man, sympathetic tosorrow, deeply understanding moods of women and children, and lovingflowers [Page 419] and trees, beasts and birds, and pomp of courtceremonial. He was author of three dramas ( p. 435), two long poems,“The Birth of War-god” ( Kumarasambhava) and “Dynasty ofRaghu”( Raghuvamśa),andtwoshorter,the“Cloud-messenger”( Meghaduta) and “Garland of Seasons” ( Rtusamhāra),as well as of several other works which hv not survived.

The “Cloud Messenger” is work of little over 100 verses, which hasalways been one of most popular of Sanskrit poems. Its theme has beenimitated in one form or another by several later poets both in Sanskrit andthe vernaculars. More than most Indian poems this work has unity andbalance, and gives sense of wholeness rarely found elsewhere. In its smallcompass Kālidasā has crowded so many lovely images and word-picturesthat poem seems to contain quintessence of whole culture. Itdescribes yaksa who dwells in divine city of Alaka, in Himalayas.

He has offended his master Kubera ( p. 313 f), and has been banished for ayear to hill of Ramagiri, in modern Madhya Pradesh. worstaspect of his exile is his separation from his beautiful wife, whom he hasleft behind in mountain city. So, at beginning of rainy season, hesees large cloud passing northward to mountains, and pours out hisheart to it. After verse or two of introduction rest of poem consistsof yaksa’s address to cloud.

First he tells it route which it must take to reach mountains; hereKālidasā describes lands, rivers and cities over which it must pass invery beautiful verses. We quote two describing river Narmadā and theforests on its banks. Notable in first verse is bird’s-eye-view impliedin simile.

“Stay for while over thickets, haunted by girls of hill-folk,then press on with faster pace, having shed your load of water,and you’ll see Narmadā river, scattered in torrents, by ruggedrocks at foot of Vindhyas,looking like plastered pattern of stripes on flank of an elephant.

18
“Note by banks flowers of nīpa trees, greenish brown, with their stamens half developed, and plantains, displaying their new buds.

Smell most fragrant earth of burnt out woodlands, and as you release your raindrops deer will show you way.” 17 [Page 420] Then cloud is told to turn westward and visit splendid city of Ujjayaini. Kālidasā cannot long resist śrngāra rasa, eroticsentiment, and this is evoked by his description of city,“where wind from Sipra river prolongs shrill melodious cryof cranes,fragrant at early dawn from scent of opening lotus,and, like lover, with flattering requests,dispels morning languor of women, and refreshes their limbs.

“Your body will grow fat with smoke of incense from open windows where women dress their hair.

You will be greeted by palace peacocks, dancing to welcome you, their friend.

If your heart is weary from travel you may pass night above mansions fragrant with flowers, whose pavements r marked with red dye from feet of lovely women.”18 Then, as cloud nears Himalayas, it will see magic city “where yaksas dwell with lovely women in white mansions, whose crystal terraces reflect stars like flowers.

They drink wine of love distilled from magic trees, while drums beat softly, deeper than your thunder.” 19 Then yaksa describes his home, and his lovely wife, weak from sorrow and longing. He gives cloud message to her, that his love is still constant and that time of reunion is approaching.

“I see your body in sinuous creeper, your gaze in startled eyes of deer,your cheek in moon, your hair in plumage of peacocks,and in tiny ripples of river I see your sidelong glances,but alas, my dearest, nowhere do I find your whole likeness!” 20“The Birth of War-god” may be described as religious poem, butthough all its characters r supernatural, and include Śiva himself, theatmosphere of poem is essentially secular. It begins with finedescription of Himalayas, from which we quote few verses. Thedaring comparison of chain of mountains to surveyor’s measuring rodis worthy of John Donne, and gives another example of Kālidasā’s bird’s-eye-view approach.

“In northern quarter is divine Himalaya, lord of mountains, reaching from Eastern to Western Oceans, firm as rod to measure earth….[Page 421] “There demigods rest in shade of cloudswhich spread like girdle below peaks,but when rains disturb themthey fly to sunlit summits. …“The hollow canes r filled with windthat bursts from chasms,as though to provide an ostinatoto songs of heavenly minstrels …“All through night phosphorescent herbsshine in caverns with their glimmering radiance,and light lovesof hill-women and their paramours …“And wind forever shaking pinescarries spray from torrents of young Gangesand refreshes hunting hillman,blowing among his peacock plumes.”21The poem, which is long one, describes courtship and marriage ofŚiva and Pārvatī ( p. 309), and birth of their son, Kumāra or Skanda, thewar-god. As he grows to manhood Kumāra is appointed general of gods,and he leads dm forth to battle with terrible demon Taraka, who haslong been afflicting whole universe. Taraka hears of their approach,musters his forces, and goes out to meet them; but terrible omens greet thearmy of demons. Here Kālidasā embarks on remarkable description,which reminds us of more macabre work of Gustave Doré.

“A fearful flock of evil birds, ready for joy of eating army of demons, flew over host of gods, and clouded sun.

“A wind continually fluttered their umbrellas and banners, and troubled their eyes with clouds of whirling dust, so that trembling horses and elephants and great chariots could not be seen.

“Suddenly monstrous serpents, as black as powdered soot, scattering poison from their upraised heads, frightful in form, appeared in army’s path.

“The sun put on ghastly robe of great and terrible snakes, curling together, as if to mark his joy at death of enemy demon.

[Page 422] “And before very disc of sun jackals bayed harshly together, as though eager fiercely to lap blood of king of foes of gods, fallen in battle.

“Lighting heaven from end to end, with flames flashing all around, with an awful crash, rending heart with terror, thunderbolt fell from cloudless sky.

“The sky poured down torrents of red-hot ashes, with which were mixed blood and human bones, till flaming ends of heaven were filled with smoke and bore dull hue of neck of an ass.

“Like thundered threat of angry death-god great crash broke walls of ears, shattering sound, tearing tops of mountains, and wholly filling belly of heaven.

“The host of foe was jostled together.

The great elephants stumbled, horses fell, and all footmen clung together in fear, as earth trembled and ocean rose to shake mountains.

“And, before host of foes of gods, dogs lifted their muzzles to gaze on sun, then, howling together with cries that rent eardrums, they wretchedly slunk away.” 2219 poem ends with death of Taraka in single combat with Kumara.

We hv no space to discuss rest of Kālidasā’s poetry, all of which is  of fine quality. “The Dynasty of Raghu” especially contains many passages of great beauty, including concise version of [Page 423] story of Rāma, but work is apparently incomplete. “The Garland of Seasons” describes six seasons of Hindu year in relation to srngara, erotic sentiment, but though charming it is slighter and less impressive than rest of Kālidasā’s work.

Many other poets after Kālidasā, wrote mahakavyas, or long courtly “epics “, but none so ably as he. Kumaradasa’s “Rape of Sītā” ( Janaki- harana) continues his tradition, while Bharavi’s “Arjuna and Kirāta” ( Kiratarjuniya), describing an encounter of hero Arjuna and god Śiva, in guise of Kirata or wild mountaineer, is somewhat more florid.

Bhatti, of 7th century, wrote remarkable poem on story of Rāma, usually known as “Bhatti’s Poem” ( Bhasikāvya), containing passages of real beauty, as an exercise to illustrate rules of grammar. Even more ingenious was 7thcentury poet Magha, who wrote long poem on an incident in life of Krsna, “Slaying of Śisupala” ( Śiśupāla-vadha).

Though work contains many fine stanzas story is so badly told that poem as whole has no semblance of unity. In nineteenth canto, which describes battle between Krsna and his enemy, Magha thought fit to display his mastery of language by inserting many stanzas of amazing ingenuity. We give an example of an ekāksara stanza, employing only one consonant throughout:
Dādado dudda-dud-dddi
dddaddo duda-di-da-doh
dud-dddam dadade dudde
dad’-ādada-dado ‘da-dah.

This stanza, using very rare and obscure words, and exceedingly
elliptical, may be translated as follows:
“The giver of gifts, giver of grief to his foes,
the bestower of purity, whose arm destroys givers of grief,
the destroyer of demons, bestower of bounty on generous and miser
alike,
raised his weapon against foe.”23
The following is dvyaksara, containing only two consonants:
Krūrāri-kārī kor eka-
kārakah kārikā-karah
korakākāra-karakah
karnrah karkaro ‘rka-ruk.

“The destroyer of cruel foes, only creator of world, bestower of woes on wicked, with hands like buds of lotuses, overthrower of elephants, fierce in battle, shone like sun.” 24 [Page 424] next stanza is called sarvatobhadra ( “valid all ways” ), and is complicated mixture of syllabic palindrome and acrostic. Each quarter-stanza is palindrome; first four syllables of first quarter r same as first syllables of each quarter, and in same order; first four syllables of second quarter r same as second syllables of each quarter, and so on. This verse is positively startling in its ingenuity, and when read in original produces an impression resembling that of complex polyphony.

Sakāra-nān’-āra-kāsa-
kāya-sāda-da-sāyakā
ras’ -āhava vāha-sāra-
nādavāda-da-vādanā.

“His army was eager for battle,
whose arrows destroyed bodies of varied hosts of his brave
enemies.

Its trumpets vied with cries
of splendid horses and elephants.”25
Finally stanza called gatapratyāgatam ( “gone and come back” ). It is a
perfect syllabic palindrome.

Tam Śriya ghanaya ‘nasta-
rucd sāratayā tayā
yataya tarasa cdru-
stanaya ‘naghay’ āsritam.

“He who was eagerly and close embraced by fair-bosomed Sri, sinless goddess, of never-failing beauty, and endowedwith every excellence.” 26After Magha longer poems often became mere displays of verbalingenuity. narrative became progressively less important, and style progressively more ornate, though there were important exceptions. Theclimax of tendency came with dvyasrayakavya, telling two stories simultaneously, by deliberately utilizing ambiguity of words andphrases. well-known example of this genre is Rāmacarita ( “Deeds ofRama” ) of 12th-century poet Sandhyakara, which may be read as applying either to legendary Rāma of Ayodhya or to historical kingRamapala of Bengal, who was poet’s contemporary and patron.


Achievements like this r not to be disparaged, but they make little appeal to European reader and r quite untranslatable.

PLATE LXXVIII

 Musme Guimet, ParisSeated Girl. Mural Painting, Ajantā. Gupta PeriodPLATE LXXIX[Page 425] best things in medieval poetry r to be found in singlestanza poems, of which there r many collections, either by one or many hands. finest poet in this genre was Bhartrhari, thought to havelived in 7th century, who left no long poems, but only three centuries ofseparate stanzas on subjects of worldly wisdom, love and renunciation respectively. These r masterpieces of concise expression, and, unlike most Sanskrit poems, tell us much about personality of author. We quotefirst two stanzas in an amusingly sententious vein.

“You may boldly take gem from jaws of crocodile,
you may swim ocean with its tossing wreath of waves,
you may wear an angry serpent like flower in your hair,
but you’ll never satisfy fool who’s set in his opinions!

“You may, if you squeeze hard enough, even get oil from sand, thirsty, you may succeed in drinking waters of mirage,perhaps, if you go far enough, you’ll find rabbit’s horn,but you’ll never satisfy fool who’s set in his opinions!”27In his erotic verses Bhartrhari often shows an undercurrent ofdissatisfaction, as though trying to convince himself that love is not futilewaste of time after all. In midst of his amours he feels call of thereligious life, and in one remarkable stanza he indulges in striking punningto this effect. obvious meaning is:“Your hair well combed, your eyes reaching to your ears, 20your mouth filled with ranks of teeth that r white by nature, yourbreasts charmingly adorned with necklace of pearls,slim girl, your body, though at rest, disturbs me.”But this might also be fancifully translated as:“Your hair self-denying, your eyes understanding whole ofscripture,your mouth full of groups of naturally-pure brahmans,your breasts lovely from presence of emancipated souls,slim girl, your body, though free from passion, disturbs me.”28This is sort of thing which most critics of Sanskrit poetry object to;but Bhartrhari might justify his punning here, for by employing words withreligious connotations he has given expression to his own divided mind.

This is very forcibly expressed in another stanza, which we quote. “The forest” implies life of hermit.

[Page 426] “What is use of many idle speeches!

Only two things r worth man’s attention-
the youth of full-breasted women, prone to fresh pleasures, and forest.”29
It would seem that in end Bhartrhari gave up love of women forthe love of God, though word which we here translate “God” is theimpersonal Brahman ( p. 250).“When I was ignorant in dark night of passionI thought world completely made of women,but now my eyes r cleansed with salve of wisdom,and my clear vision sees only God in everything.”30Bhartrhari’s religious experience was intense enough to produce thefollowing splendid pæan, in which he addressed five elements of Hinduphysics.

“Oh Earth, my mother, Air, my father, Oh Fire, my friend,
Water, my kinsman, Space, my brother,
here do I bow before you with folded hands!With your aid I hv done good deeds and found clear knowledge,and, glorious, with all delusion past, I merge in highest godhead.” 31An erotic poet with none of Bhartrhari’s doubts was Amaru, alsoprobably of 7th century. His stanzas on love r often voluptuous, butthey cn be humorously tender, and always show sound understanding offeminine psychology. Amaru loved to describe poignant moment in ahuman relationship in single verse, in which reader is given only theclimax of story, reconstruction of rest being left to hisimagination.

‘We’ll see what comes of it,’ I thought, and hardened my heart against
her.

‘What, won’t villain speak to me?’ she thought, flying into a
rage.

And there we stood, sedulously refusing to look one another in the
face,


until at last I managed an unconvincing laugh, and her tears
robbed me of my resolution.”
‘Why r your limbs so weak, and why do you tremble?

And why, my dear,’ asked her lord, ‘is your cheek so pale?’
The slender girl replied, ‘It’s just my nature!’
and turned away and sighed, and let loose tears that burdened
her eyelids.”

[Page 427] ‘Fool that I was, why didn’t I clasp lord of my life to my neck?

Why did I turn my face away when he wanted to kiss me? Why did I not see? Why did I not speak?’ So, when love is firstawakened,a girl is filled with remorse as she thinks of her childishshyness.” 32We cannot devote much more space to many brief poems of theMiddle Ages, which r so full of charm and skill, and which need acompetent translator to introduce dm to West. In passing, however, wewould quote two stanzas contained in prose work called “The Deeds ofHarsa”, by 7th-century writer Bāna ( p. 446ff), which r sung by bardat dawn to rouse his companions. In our opinion these neglected verses areamong finest in Indian literature. Ostensibly they describe greatstallion waking from sleep, but it may be that poet remembered thecosmic symbolism of horse in Vedic times ( p. 248), and intended tospeak of universal in terms of particular. Bāna had evidentlycarefully studied his subject, which he describes almost anatomically, inwords which hv few overtones of meaning; but he succeeds in conveyinghis own deep delight in horse by subtle alliterative effects, by heavymetre, which he handles with masterly skill, and by implicit contrast ofthe tiny piece of chaff in last line.

“He stretches his hind-leg, and, bending his spine, extends his body upwards.
Curving his neck, he rests his muzzle on his chest, and tosses hisdustgrey mane.The steed, his nostrils ceaselessly quivering with desire of fodder,rises from his bed, gently whinnies, and paws earth with hishoof.“He bends his back and turns his neck sideways, till his face toucheshis buttock,and then horse, curls matted about his ears,rubs with his hoof red corner of his eye, itching from sleep,his eye, struck by his dewdrop-scattering mane, waving andtossing,his eye, to point of whose quivering eyelash there clings tinyfragment of chaff.” 3321[Page 428] Before leaving this style of poetry we should mention theKashmiri Bilhana, of 11th and 12th centuries, whose “Fifty Stanzas ofthe Thief” ( Caurapañcāśikā), purporting to describe secret love of abold housebreaker and princess, r full of intense emotion recollectedwithout tranquillity. Each begins with words “Even today”.

“Even today I cn see her, her slender arms encircling my neck,
my breast held tight against her two breasts,
her playful eyes half-closed in ecstasy,
her dear face drinking mine in kiss.

“Even today, if this evening I might see my beloved, with eyes like eyes of fawn, with bowls of her breasts colour of milk, I’d leave joys of kingship and heaven and final bliss.” 34 In class of its own is Jayadeva’s “Songs of Cowherd” ( Gita Govinda), written in Bengal in 12th century. This is series of dramatic lyrics intended for singing, and describes love of Krsna for Rgdha andthe milkmaids ( p. 304f). poem is still sung at festivals of theBengali Vaisnavite sects, but though it begins with beautiful invocation tothe ten incarnations of Visnu its inspiration to Western mind seemsrather erotic than religious. Unlike almost all other classical Sanskrit poetryJayadeva’s lyrics r rhymed, and look forward to verse forms ofvernacular literature. Each commences with an introductory stanza in one ofthe more usual Sanskrit metres, and final stanza of each introduces thepoet’s name. verses which we translate describe Krsna’s longings whenseparated from his beloved Rādhā. “The foe of Madhu” ( demon killed byKrsna) and Hari r epithets of god.

‘Here I am dwelling. Go now to Rādhā,console her with my message, and bring her to me.’Thus foe of Madhu commissioned her friend,who went in person, and spoke to Rādhā thus:‘When breeze blows from Southern Mountains,and brings Love-god with it,when masses of flowers burst forthto rend hearts of parted lovers,he is grieved at separation from you, decked with his forest garland.

‘Even cool-rayed moon inflames him,
he is as if dead.

Struck by arrows of love
he complains most wretchedly.

He is grieved …
[Page 429] ‘When swarming bees r murmuring
he closes fast his ears.

His heart is clenched by parting,
he spends his nights in fever.

He is grieved. …
‘He dwells in depths of forest,
he has left his lovely home.

He tosses in sleep on earth
and much he murmurs your name.

He is grieved. …’
“When poet Jayadeva sings,
through this pious description
of deeds of parted lover,
may Hari arise in hearts full of zeal.

He is grieved at separation from you, decked with his forest
garland.” 3522

## Narrative Poetry
As well as various smaller collections there exists in various recensions alarge series of popular stories, Brhatkathā ( “Great Story” ), boxed onewithin other in manner of “The Thousand and One Nights”. Themost famous of these versions is Somadeva’s “Ocean of Story” ( Kathā-sarit-sāgara), written in 1 th century in easy but polished verse. Thestories r told with comparative simplicity and directness, and with manytouches of humour and pathos. We quote from tale of thief and themerchant’s daughter. wealthy merchant, Ratnadatta, has no sons, and hisonly daughter, Ratnavati, much loved and pampered by her father, refusesto marry, despite pleading of her parents. Meanwhile desperate thiefhas been captured by king, and is led through streets to execution by
impalement.

“To beat of drum thief was led
to place of execution,
and merchant’s daughter Ratnavati
sat on terrace and watched him.

He was gravely wounded and covered with dust,
but as soon as she saw him she was smitten with love.

[Page 430] “Then she went to her father Ratnadatta, and said:
‘This man they r leading to his death
I hv chosen for my lord!

Father, you must save him from king,
or I will die with him!’
And when he heard, her father said:
‘What is this you say, my child?

You’ve refused finest suitors,
the images of Love-god!

How cn you now desire
a wretched master-thief?’
“But though he reproached her thus
she was firm in her resolve,
so he sped to king and begged
that thief might be saved from stake.

In return he offered
the whole of his great fortune,
but king would not yield thief
for ten million pieces of gold,
for he had robbed whole city,
and was brought to stake to repay with his life.

“Her father came home in despair,
and merchant’s daughter
determined to follow
the thief in his death.

Though her family tried to restrain her
she bathed,
and mounted litter, and went
to place of impalement,
while her father, her mother and her people
followed her weeping.

“The executioners placed
the thief on stake,
and, as his life ebbed away,
he saw her come with her people.

He heard onlookers speaking
of all that had happened,
For moment he wept, and then,
smiling little, he died.

At her order they lifted corpsefrom stake, and took it away,and with it worthy merchant’s daughtermounted pyre.”3623[Page 431] modern European reader would find this conclusiveending to tale of old, unhappy, far-off things; but to Indian of medievaltimes such an ending would hv been quite unsatisfactory, so deus exmachina was brought in in form of god Śiva, who was so impressedby girl’s love and faithfulness that he restored corpse of deadthief to life. He reformed his ways and became king’s general, and thetwo were married and lived happily ever after.

In category of narrative poems we must include Kalhana’s greatchronicle of Kashmīr “The River of Kings” ( p. 44), and several othermedieval works of comparatively small literary value. Midway between thepurely narrative poem and courtly “epic” r number of historicalworks partly descriptive, partly panegyric, and partly sober history. Themost famous of these is “The Deeds of Harsa”, by Bana, written in ornatepoetic prose, which is discussed below ( p. 447ff). Of some literary merit is“The Deeds of Vikramānka” ( Vikramānkadevacarita), of Bilhana ( p. 428),dealing with life and adventures of great Calukya emperorVikramaditya VI ( c. 1075–1125). Another example of this type is theRāmacarita, already mentioned. Yet another is work of Jaina monk,Nayacandra Sūri, Hammīra-mahākāvya, which is among latestimportant works of Sanskrit literature. This beautiful but little known poemdeals with life of Hammīra, last of dynasty of Cahamanas,who was defeated and killed by Delhi sultan Alauddīn Khaljī in 1301,after long siege of his capital Ranasthambhapura ( in vernacular,Ranthambhor). As Hammīra was slain with all his followers poet wasforced by his theme somewhat to flout convention, but he managed to retaina semblance of happy ending demanded by tradition by concluding hiswork with description of entry of Hammīra and his followers intoheaven. Much of poem, though not without beauty, is irrelevant to main theme, but description of king’s last days is direct and forceful.

Towards end of poem Nayacandra introduces remarkable episode. We cannot say whether he consciously intended beautiful dancer who died so tragically as symbol of courtly culture which fell to invader, but it is thus that passage, occurring so portentously just before Hammlra’s death, strikes reader. In course of siege atemporary truce has been arranged, and Rajputs r making most ofit. On battlements musical entertainment is taking place, andHammīra’s favourite dancer, Radhādevī, is performing for king and hiscourtiers. long bowshot away, on other side of moat, sits thesultan, also watching dance with interest. He is referred to in poemas Lord of [Page 432] Śakas, term at this time applied to all theinvaders of North-West. first part of our extract is exceedinglyflorid, and full of untranslatable puns, but style suddenly becomessimple and terse when episode moves to its climax.

“In time drummers beat their drums, lutanists plucked their
lutes,
the flautists blew their flutes.

Their voices in tune with shrill flutes, singerssang glory and fame of brave Hammira …Then, vine of her body entrancing her lovers,awakening passion with glance of her half-closed eyes,to delight hearts of courtiers,came Rādhadevī dancer, arrayed for dance.

“The quivering buds of her fingers moved in dance
like tendrils of vine, thrilling with passion. …
As tips of her fingers bent, as though in circle,
with her grace and delicate beauty all other girls seemed her slaves.

The moon, in guise of ring that trembled from tip of her ear,said: ‘Your face is my likeness, delusion even of sages!’And as she danced she stirred hearts of young men watchingthehearts which lay like motes of camphor under her feet. …With her gestures necklace trembled on tips of her breastslike lotus twined in beak of swan.When her body bent back like bow in dancelike bowstring braid of her hair stretched down to her heel …“And as she danced, at every beat of rhythm,she turned her back on Saka king below.

“Then in fury of soul Lord of Sakas spoke to his
chamberlain:
‘Is there any bowman who cn make her his mark?’His brother said:’Sire, there is he whom you formerly threw intoprison,Uddanasimha-he is only man who cn do it!’At once Saka king had him brought, and struck off his fetters,and arrayed traitor finely, with double gift of affection.

And thus apparelled he took bow which none but he could draw,
and sinner shot her, as hunter shoots doe.


“At stroke of arrow she fainted and fell in moat,as lightning falls from heaven.”3724The DramaThe origin of Indian theatre is still obscure. It is certain, however, thateven in Vedic period dramatic performances of some kind [Page 433]were given, and passing references in early sources point to enaction atfestivals of religious legends, perhaps only in dance and mime. Somewriters hv found elements in common between Indian and theclassical Greek theatre. curtain at back of thestagewascalledyavanikā, diminutive form of name by which Greeks weregenerally known in India. One play at least, “The Little Clay Cart” ( p. 441),has superficial resemblancetothelate Greek comedy of school ofMenander. We cannot wholly reject hypothesis that Greek comedies,acted at courts of Greco-Bactrian kings ofN.W.India,inspiredunknown Indian poets to develop their own popular stage into courtly art
form.

The surviving Sanskrit dramas r numerous and varied, ranging from
short one-act playlets to very long plays in ten acts. They were normally performed by troupes of professionals of both sexes, but amateur dramaticswere not wholly unknown, since we hv occasional references to kingsand ladies of harem performing dramas in palace. There was noregular theatre, though it has been suggested that one of caves ofRamgarh ( p. 185) was specially adapted for theatrical performances.

Normally dramas were performed privately or semi-privately in palaces or
the homes of rich, or were given public showing in temple courts on
days of festival.
A curtain ( yavanikā) divided stage ( ranga) from backstage( nepathya), and through this actors made their entrances. There was nocurtain between stage and auditorium. drama was performed withoutscenery and with minimum of properties; absence of both was madeup for by highly developed gesture language of dance, which wehave discussed elsewhere ( p. 385). Every part of body was used to helptell story, and welltrained audience recognized from conventionalmovements of hands, limbs and features that king was riding in hischariot, or that heroine was caressing her pet fawn. splendid attireof actors was regulated by convention, so that heroes, heroines, gods,demons, villains, and so on were immediately recognizable.The drama regularly began with an invocation to one or more of thegods, and prologue, in which chief actor and stage manager( sutradhara) humorously discussed with his wife, chief actress, theoccasion of performance and nature of play to be performed. 25The main dialogue of play was in prose, but this was freely interspersedwith verses, which were usually declaimed or intoned, but not sung. In thisancient Indian taste differed from that of [Page 434] present-day India,which demands many songs in plays and films. classical unities werenot observed; years in time and thousand miles in space might divide onescene from next; but within act unity of time and place wasdemanded. If in this respect Indian dramatic convention differed fromthat of classical Europe, it agreed in forbidding portrayal of acts ofviolence on stage, though this and other rules were sometimes ignored.The act was often preceded by prelude ( praveśaka), in which one or twocharacters set scene, and described what had gone before.As in literature generally, so in theatre Indian convention allowed notragedy. Tragic and pathetic scenes were common enough, but endings werealmost invariably happy. From European point of view insistence onthe happy ending often led to unnatural forcing of plot. But if herejected tragedy ancient Indian playgoer delighted in melodrama andpathos. Though emotion which Indian writer sought to arouse wastheoretically sublimated one ( p. 417), in fact Sanskrit drama containsso many melodramatic scenes that emotional Indian audience mustoften hv been moved to tears. Noble heroes r led to execution forcrimes they did not commit, declaiming their innocence to their sorrowingwives and children, to be saved from stake at last moment. Unhappywives r unjustly expelled from their homes by their husbands. Long-lostchildren r reunited with their parents in final act. Whatever thetheorists, beginning with Bharata ( p. 382), may hv said, sentiment ofthe Indian drama was warm and living, sometimes little reminiscent ofthat of more popular English authors of last century.

Like Greek and Elizabethan dramatists Indian writers usually borrowed
their plots from earlier sources, often adapting dm freely in process.

Legends of gods and ancient heroes formed an inexhaustible mine ofdramatic material. Other plays were written around popular tales of asecular type. There r also dramas of statecraft, based very freely onstories of historical kings of past, and light comedies of harem intrigue,wherein hero, king, succeeds in pacifying chief queen, who has sether heart against promotion of heroine, servant girl ( usually aprincess in disguise), to queenly status and her husband’s bed. There arealso allegorical dramas, in which characters r personified virtues andvices, and there r few surviving examples of farces. Plays wereclassified by theorists acc to style and length into over adozencategories.The hero ( nāyaka) and heroine ( nāyikā) r inevitable characters in mosttypes of drama, as is villain ( pratināyaka). An interesting [Page 435]stock character is vidusaka, who provides comic relief; he is an ugly andmisshapen brāhman, loyal friend of hero, but invariably figure offun. Another stock character, occurring in one or two extant dramas andnoted by theorists, is vita, cultured but rather shallow man of theworld who befriends hero, and somewhat resembles parasite ofclassical Greek comedy.
The earliest known dramas to hv survived r fragments of plays byAśvaghosa ( p. 415), preserved in manuscripts found in desert sands ofCentral Asia. oldest complete plays r probably those attributed toBhasa, which seem to be earlier than those of Kālidasā, though there is nocomplete unanimity of experts on this point. Bhasa’s thirteen survivingplays include several works of great merit, notably “The Vision ofVasavadatta” ( Svapnavasavadatta) and “Yaugandharayana’s Vows“( Pratijfiyaugandhardyana). Bhasa also wrote number of short dramasbased on epic stories in simple and vigorous style. Nowadays his plays areoften first introduction of student of Sanskrit to dramatic literature.

He excelled in portraying heroic sentiment, and ably individualized his characters. More than once he broke rules of later dramatic theory by permitting acts of violence on stage.
As in English literature so in Sanskrit, greatest poet was also thegreatest dramatist. Three plays of Kālidasā hv survived: “Malavika andAgnimitra”, comedy of harem intrigue, its scene set in Śunga period;“Urvaśī Won by Valour” ( Vikramorvasi), telling ancient story of thelove of Purūravas and Urvaśī ( p. 405ff); and “The Recognition ofŚakuntalā” ( Abhijñānaśakuntala). At all times last has been reckonedKālidasā’s masterpiece, and merits special consideration. plot is set inthe days of legend, when gods and men were not so far apart as they laterbecame. We give an almost complete translation of fifth act, with asummary of rest of play.

The play opens with King Dusyanta chasing deer in theneighbourhood of forest hermitage. He alights from his chariot to payhomage to chief of hermits, sage Kanva. Kanva is not at home,but king meets his foster-daughter, Śakuntalā, illegitimate child ofthe nymph Menaka ( p. 317), who runs on to stage harassed by bee,and is freed from its attentions by gallant King. Naturally he falls inlove with her, and with due modesty she shows that she returns hisaffection. second act shows Dusyanta in throes of love. He cannotpress his suit in absence of Sakuntala’s foster-father, so he remains inthe neighbourhood of hermitage, ostensibly to defend it from wildelephants and demons. In third act Sakuntala is languid and sick withlove. She confesses her feelings to her two friends, Anasiiya andPriyamvada, who persuade her to [Page 436] write letter to King. Asshe is writing, King, who has heard every thing from nearby thicket,comes on scene, and two friends withdraw. He gives Sakuntala aring, and, by plighting their troth, they r married by gāndharva rite ( p.

168).

In fourth act Dusyanta has been recalled to his capital by affairs of state, leaving Sakuntala behind. Kanva is still away. Meanwhile great and irascible hermit, Durvasas, visits hermitage, and, as result of fancied slight, he curses Sakuntala, saying that she will be forgotten by her husbanduntil he sees ring he gave her. Meanwhile Kanva returns. He knowsalready of what has happened, and decides to send now pregnantSakuntala to King. In scene of great pathos she takes leave of herfoster-father and her friends, and sets out for capital in care of twohermits and an elderly hermit-woman, Gautami. fifth act shows us thecourt of Dusyanta. Sakuntala, veiled, is ushered in with her attendants. Shereminds King of their love, and attendants testify to her words; butthe curse of Durvasas has effaced all memory of her from King’s mind,and he does not recognize her.

GAUTAMI. Child! Put your modesty on one side minute and take off your veil. Then His Majesty will recognize you. ( She does so. ) KING ( looking at Sakuntala, aside).

This shape of untarnished beauty is offered me.

I ponder, whether or not I really wed her.

I am like bee in jasmine wet with dawn dew-
I cannot now enjoy her, nor cn I leave her.

( He remains deep in thought. )
THE DOORKEEPER ( aside). How His Majesty respects Sacred Law!

Who else would think twice about beauty so easily come by?

ŚARNGARAVA ( one of ascetics). Your Majesty, why r you so silent?

THE KING. Hermits, I’ve been racking my brains, but I’ve no recollection
whatever of marrying this lady. How cn I accept her, … especially when
she shows such obvious signs of pregnancy?

SAKUNTALA ( aside). His Majesty doubts that we were ever married!

What has become of my high-soaring hopes?

ŚARANGARAVA. So you won’t take her!

The sage indeed deserves your scorn,
for he respects his outraged daughter,
he gives to you wealth you stole from him,
and treats robber as an honest man!

SARADVATA ( other ascetic). That’s enough, Śarigarava! Śakuntala,
we’ve said all we cn say, and His Majesty has spoken! Now it’s up to you!

You must say something that will convince him.

ŚAKUNTALĀ ( aside). When his passion has sunk to such depths what’s [Page 437] good of reminding him of it! only thing I’m sure of is that I’m to be pitied! ( Aloud. ) Your Majesty! ( Her voice drops to anundertone). Even though you doubt your marriage to me, this isn’t wayyou ought to receive me. I’m girl who is naturally open-hearted. Is it rightthat you should make promises to me at hermitage and then deceive me,and now use such harsh words to throw me aside?

THE KING ( putting his hands to his ears). Heaven forbid!

Why do you try to sully your kin
and bring me to ruin,
as river dashing against its banks
sullies its water and fells tree on shore?

ŚAKUNTALĀ. All right! If you really think I’m another man’s wife I’ll
clear up your doubts by this token!

THE KING. That’s good idea!

ŚAKUNTALĀ ( feeling her ring-finger). Oh dear! Oh dear!! ring isn’t on
my finger! ( She looks at Gautamī in distress. )
GAUTAMI. ring must hv slipped off your finger while you were
bathing.

THE KING ( smiling). There’s well-known saying–“A woman always has
her wits about her”!

ŚAKUNTALĀ. Fate’s against me again! One thing more I want to say.

THE KING. Very well! I’ll listen!

ŚAKUNTALĀ. One day when we were in bower of creepers you had a
lotus leaf filled with water in your hand.THE KING. I’m listening.ŚAKUNTALĀ. Then my pet fawn Dirghāpanga came up, and you held outthe water and tried to get him to come to you, and said tenderly that heshould hv first drink, but he wouldn’t come near your hand becausehe didn’t know you. So I held him, and he took water from me, and youlaughed and said, “Everyone trusts his own kind-after all, you’re bothchildren of forest!”THE KING. Those r sort of sweet and lying phrases with whichscheming women fool men of world!GAUTAMI. Good sir, you shouldn’t say such things. This girl wasbrought up in hermitage, and she knows nothing of deceit.THE KING. Old woman!Eveninbirdsandbeaststhefemale needs no lessons in deceit!How much less she who has power of reason!Cuckoos, before they take to flight,make sure that other birds will rear their chicks![Page 438] ŚAKUNTALĀ ( angrily). You wretch! You judge me by themeasure of your own heart! Was there ever bigger hypocrite? You, in yourcloak of righteousness-you’re like well covered over with grass!THE KING ( aside). Her anger seems quite genuine and makes me havesecond thoughts.She must think my soul is vile in its forgetfulness,and in not acknowledging our secret love.At knitting of brows of her eyes red with angerthe bow of Love-god is snapped in two.( Aloud). Good woman. movements of King Dusyanta r commonknowledge, and nobody knows anything about this.ŚAKUNTALĀ. So be it! Here am I, turned into wanton, and all because Itrusted race of Pūru, and fell into clutches of man who had honeyon his tongue and poison in his heart. ( She covers herface with end ofher robe and weeps. )
ŚĀRĀGARAVA. So you hv to suffer for your own folly, when you don’t
keep check on your impulses.

One should think hard before making love,
especially in secret.

Friendship to those whose hearts we know not
soon turns to hatred.

THE KING. What, do you trust this lady enough to attack me with your
censorious words?

ŚĀRĀGARAVA ( scornfully). You hear things upside down!

The word of one who from her birthhas learnt no guile carries no weight at all,but they who hv mastered science of deceithave power to speak words of authority.THE KING. Honest sir, if for sake of argument I admit youraccusation, tell me what good it would do me to deceive her.ŚĀRĀGARAVA. You’d reap your own ruin.THE KING. And surely it’s unbelievable that king of line of Pūrushould seek his own ruin?SARADVATA. Śārigarava, what’s use of arguing with him? We’vecarried out Teacher’s command, now let’s go home. ( To KING. )Here is Your Lordship’s wifeleave her or accept her.It is said that husband’s powerover wife is all-embracing.[Page 439] Gautami, let’s go! ( They make for door. )
ŚAKUNTALĀ. Oh, how I’ve been cheated by this deceiver! You mustn’t
leave me! ( Shefollows them. )
GAUTAMI. ( pausing. ) Look, Śārngarava, my child Sakuntala is following
us and crying pitifully. Oh, what will my little girl do, now that her husband
has cast her off so cruelly?

ŚĀRĀGARAVA ( turning sternly). Wanton, you r too independent!

( Śakuntalā trembles withfear. )
Śārngarava. Śakuntalā
If you r what king says you are
you r cast off by your family, and your father is nothing to you;
but if you know your vow to be true
even bondage in your husband’s home is good.

You must stay behind, and we must go!

THE KING. Hermit, why do you delude this lady?

The moon awakens night-flowering lotuses,
and sun those that flower by day.

The way of man of self-control
is to hv no dealings with wife of another.

ŚĀRĀGARAVA. When Your Majesty has such short memory for his past
deeds he does well to be so fearful of sin!

THE KING ( to Chief Priest).26 I ask you rights and wrongs of the
matter.

I wonder, am I forgetful,
or has she told me lies?

Shall I abandon my own wife
or sin by touching another’s?

THE CHIEF PRIEST ( thoughtfully). If you ask me, this is what I think
should be done.

THE KING. Command me, Your Honour!

THE CHIEF PRIEST. Let lady stay in my home until child is born Ifyou ask why, this is my reason-Long ago wise men told you that yourfirst son would become universal emperor. If son of hermit’sdaughter bears tokens of such kingship you should congratulate her andtake her into your harem-otherwise send her back to her father.

THE KING. It shall be as my master pleases.

THE CHIEF PRIEST. Child, follow me!

[Page 440] ŚAKUNTALĀ. O holy Earth, open for me! ( She starts to go, and
leaves with Chief Priest. hermits depart. King, his memoryclouded by curse, thinks about Sakuntala. )38Soon Chief Priest returns. As he was leading Sakuntala to his home aheavenly shape appeared and carried her up to heaven. It was her mother,the nymph Menaka, who had come to take her to her true parents’ home forher confinement.

Act six introduces two policemen and fishermen. He has found a
precious ring in maw of fish, and is hauled before king under the
suspicion of having stolen it. As soon as Dusyanta sees ring herecognizes it as one he gave Sakuntala, and his memory returns. ButSakuntala has vanished. For while King gives himself up to grief, forhe has lost his wife and he has no heir. Soon he assuages his sorrow inaction, for Matali, charioteer of Indra, brings him word that his help isneeded in long war between gods and demons.

The final act takes place several years later on lower slopes ofheaven, at hermitage of divine sage Mārīca. Dusyanta is returningvictorious from battle, when he sees small boy, nobly wrestling with atame lion cub. He stops his chariot to admire child’s courage andstrength, and is told that he is Bharata, son of Sakuntala. lovers arereunited, and all ends happily.

In many respects “Sakuntala” is comparable to more idyllic comediesof Shakespeare, and Kanva’s hermitage is surely not far from Forest ofArden. plot of play, like many of Shakespeare’s plots, dependsmuch on happy chances and on supernatural, which, of course, wasquite acceptable to audience for which Kālidasā wrote. Its characters,even to minor ones, r happily delineated individuals. In passagewe hv quoted two hermits, who play no further part in action, aresharply differentiated. Śārāgarava is brave and upright man, fearless in hisdenunciation of wickedness in high places, but rather stern and hard in hisrighteousness. Saradvata, on other hand, betrays himself in two lines asa moral weakling, anxious to escape from an unpleasant situation as quicklyas possible. Kālidasā makes no pretence to realism, but his dialogue is freshand vigorous. In fact dialogue of better Sanskrit plays generallyseems based on vernacular, and is full of idiomatic expressions. Indianplaygoers did not demand conflict of feelings and emotions which is thechief substance of serious European drama, but Kālidasā was quite capableof portraying such conflict effectively. His beauties and merits r tarnishedby any translation, but few who cn read him in original would doubtthat, both as poet and dramatist, he was one of great men of world.

PLATE LXXXII
[Page 441] There were many other dramatists, of whom we cn only mention few. Śūdraka, probably Kālidasā’s approximate contemporary, has left only one play “The Little Clay Cart” ( Mrcchakatika). This is most realistic of Indian dramas, unravelling complicated story, rich inhumour and pathos and crowded with action, of love of poor brāhman,Carudatta, for virtuous courtezan Vasantasena; this story is interwovenwith one of political intrigue, leading up to overthrow of wickedking Palaka, and play contains vivid trial scene, after which hero issaved from execution at last moment. It is notable for its realisticdepiction of city life, and for its host of minor characters, all of whom aredrawn with skill and individuality. It has more than once been performed intranslation on European stage, and, to Western audience, is certainlythe most easily appreciated of Indian plays.

Visakhadatta ( 16th century) was dramatist of politics. His onlycomplete surviving play, “The Minister’s Signet Ring “( Mudrdrāksasa),deals with schemes of wily Canakya ( p. 50) to foil plots ofRaksasa, minister of last of Nandas, and to place CandraguptaMaurya firmly on throne. plot is exceedingly complicated, but isworked out with great skill, and play is beautifully constructed to leadup, like “The Little Clay Cart”, to pathetic scene where one of chiefcharacters is saved from death by impalement at last moment. Anotherplay by Visakhadatta, “The Queen and Candra Gupta” ( Devicandragupta),purporting to tell story of rise to power of Candra Gupta II ( p. 65),exists only in fragments.

Three plays r ascribed to great king Harsa ( p. 68f), though they maybe work of “ghost writer”. They r “Ratnavali”, “Priyadarāikī”, and“The Joy of Serpents “( Nāgānanda). first two, named after theirheroines, r charming harem comedies, while last is play of religiouspurport, telling of prince Jīmūitavahāna, who gives his own body to put astop to sacrifice of serpents to divine Garuda ( p. 300).

With Harsa we may link his royal contemporary, Pallava king Mahendravikramavarman, who has left one-act play “The Sport of Drunkards “( Mattavilasa). It treats of drunken Saivite ascetic, who loses skull which he uses as begging bowl, and accuses Buddhist monk ofstealing it. After much satirical dialogue, in which other dissolute asceticsof various persuasions and both sexes r involved, it is found that skullhas been stolen by dog. This little farce, though slight, throws flood oflight on life of times and is full of Rabelaisian humour.

Second only to Kālidasā in esteem of critics was Bhavabhāti, [Page 442] who lived at Kānyakubjain early 8th century. Three of his plays survive-“Mālatī and Mādhava”, “The Deeds of Great Hero” ( Mahdviracarita), and “The Later Deeds of Rama” ( UttaraRāmacarita).

The first is love story with pseudo-realistic background, full of incident of an exciting or horrific type, in which heroine is more than once rescued from death, while two latter plays tell story of Rāma. ByWestern standards as dramatist Bhavabhūti falls short of those we havementioned earlier. His plots r weakly constructed and his characters lackindividuality. His greatness rests on his deep understanding of sorrow; inhis treatment of pathetic and terrible he perhaps excels Kālidasā.

After Bhavabhūti quality of Sanskrit drama declined. Playwrights ofsome merit, such as Bhatta Nārāyana ( ? 8th century), Murāri ( early 9thcentury), Rājaśekhara ( 9th-loth centuries), and Krsnamiśra ( 11th century),continued to write dramas, but their work grew more and more literary, andwas evidently often rather intended for reading than for performance. Wehave records of occasional production of Sanskrit plays until theMuslim invasion, after which Sanskrit theatrical tradition, though notforgotten, became thing of past.

## Sanskrit Prose Literature
The earliest surviving prose stories r few narrative episodes in brāhmanas ( p. 405f), followed by Pali Jatakas ( p. 454f). In Gupta period, however, there developed style of ornate prose narrative, which was very different from simple Pali stories, and was classed as kavya.

The chief writers in this genre were Dandin, Subandhu and Bana, all of whom lived in late 6th and early 7th centuries.

Dandin’s “Tales of Ten Princes” ( DaśaKumāracarita) is collectionof exciting and ingenious stories, held together by framing narrative andall interwoven with great skill. prose is comparatively simple. Longcompounds r numerous, but inordinately lengthy sentences of Bānaare not to be found. stories r secular, often humorous, and sometimesamoral, while characters r well delineated. Some of interest of the“Ten Princes “lies in its comparative realism, for in their adventures tenheroes come in contact with merchants and thieves, princesses andprostitutes, peasants and wild hillmen. Few works of Indian literature tell usso much about low life.

As examples of Dandin’s style we give two little stories which arecontained within larger tales, and r intended to show contrastingaspects of character of fair sex. styles r sharply [Page 443]differentiated to fit themes; grisly story of Dhūminī is told in crispshort sentences with great economy of detail, while in domestic idyll ofGomini Dandin lingers lovingly on his words, and describes charmingscene in leisurely periods.

“There is country called Trigarta, where there lived three householders, who had accumulated great fortune. They were brothers, called Dhanaka, Dhanyaka and Dhanyaka. In those days Indra gave no rain for twelve years.

The corn withered, plants were barren, trees bore no fruit, and cloudswere impotent; water courses dried up, ponds became mere mudholes, andthe springs ceased to flow. Bulbs, roots and fruit became scarce, folk-taleswere forgotten, and all festive merrymaking ceased. Robber bandsmultiplied, and people ate one another’s flesh. Human skulls, white ascranes,rolled on ground. Flocks of thirsty crows flew hither and thither.Villages, cities, whole districts, were deserted.“The three householders first ate their store of grain and then one by onetheir goats, their sheep, their buffaloes, their cows, their maidservants, theirmenservants, their children, and wives of eldest and middlebrother. Finally they decided that next day they would eat Dhūminī, thewife of youngest; but youngest brother, Dhanyaka, could not bringhimself to eat his darling, so that night he stole away withher.“When she grew weary he carried her, until they came to forest … andthey walked on through it until at last they came upon man who waswrithing on ground, with his hands, feet, ears and nose cut off. Hecompassionately supported this man too on his shoulder, and for long timethe three dwelt in hut which he painstakingly built of leaves in corner ofthe forest which abounded in edible bulbs, roots and game. He healed theman’s wounds with almond and sesamum oil, and fed him with full shareof his own meat and vegetables.

“One day when man had quite recovered and was restored to health,
when Dhanyaka had gone hunting, Dhūminī approached man withdesire for pleasure, and though he upbraided her she compelled him tosatisfy her. When her husband came back and asked for water she said,‘Draw it from well yourself, I’ve got splitting headache’, and tossedhim bucket and rope. As he was drawing water from well she creptup suddenly behind him and pushed him in.

“Supporting cripple on her shoulder she wandered from land to land,
and gained reputation of devoted wife, and was much honoured.

Finally she settled in Avanti, and lived in great affluence, thanks to thegenerosity of king. One day she heard that her husband had beenrescued from well by band of thirsty merchants, and was now roamingabout land of Avanti, begging his food. So Dhūminī declared to theunwitting king that he was villain who had crippled her husband, and hecondemned good man to death by torture.“As Dhanyaka was being led to execution, knowing that his appointedtime had not yet come, he boldly said to officer in charge, ‘If beggar[Page 444] I’m supposed to hv crippled is ready to condemn me I deservemy punishment!’ officer thought that no harm could come of testing[his words, so he sent for cripple]. As soon as cripple was broughtand saw Dhanyaka his eyes filled with tears. He fell at good man’s feet,and, being man of noble mind, he told of Dhanyaka’s kindness and thefalse Dhūmini’s wickedness. enraged king had wicked woman’sface disfigured, and made her serve as cook in his kennels, while hebestowed great favour on Dhanyaka. And that is why I say that women arehardhearted.”“In land of Dravidians is city called Kāñcī. Therein dwelt thevery wealthy son of merchant, by name ŚaktiKumāra. When he wasnearly eighteen he thought: ‘There’s no pleasure in living without wife orwith one of bad character. Now how cn I find really good one?’ So,dubious of his chance of finding wedded bliss with woman taken at theword of others, he became fortune-teller, and roamed land with ameasure of unhusked rice tied in skirts of his robe; and parents, takinghim for an interpreter of birthmarks, showed their daughters to him.

Whenever he saw girl of his own class, whatever her birthmarks, he
would say to her: ‘My dear girl, cn you cook me good meal from this
measure of rice?’ And so, ridiculed and rejected, he wandered from house
to house.

“One day in land of Śibis, in city on banks of Kāverī, he examined girl who was shown to him by her nurse. She wore little jewellery, for her parents had spent their fortune, and had nothing left buttheir dilapidated mansion. As soon as he set eyes on her he thought: ‘Thisgirl is shapely and smooth in all her members. Not one limb is too fat or toothin, too short or too long. Her fingers r pink; her hands r marked withauspicious lines-the barleycorn, fish, lotus and vase; her anklesare shapely; her feet r plump and veins r not prominent; her thighscurve smoothly; her knees cn barely be seen, for they merge into herrounded thighs; her buttocks r dimpled and round as chariot wheels; hernavel is small, flat and deep; her stomach is adorned with three lines; thenipples stand out from her large breasts, which cover her whole chest; herpalms r marked with signs which promise corn, wealth and sons; her nailsare smooth and polished like jewels; her fingers r straight and taperingand pink; her arms curve sweetly from shoulder, and r smoothlyjointed; her slender neck is curved like conch-shell; her lips r roundedand of even red; her pretty chin does not recede; her cheeks r round, fulland firm; her eyebrows do not join above her nose, and r curved, dark andeven; her nose is like half-blown sesamum flower; her wide eyes r largeand gentle and flash with three colours, black, white and brown; her brow isfair as new moon; her curls r lovely as mine of sapphires; her longears r adorned doubly, with earrings and charming lotuses, hanginglimply; her abundant hair is not brown, even at tips, 27 but long, smooth,glossy and fragrant. character of such girl cannot but correspond to[Page 445] her appearance, and my heart is fixed upon her, so I’ll test herand marry her. For one regret after another is sure to fall on heads ofpeople who don’t take precautions!’ So, looking at her affectionately, hesaid, ‘Dear girl, cn you cook good meal for me with this measure ofrice?’“Then girl glanced at her old servant, who took measure of ricefrom his hand and seated him on veranda, which had been wellsprinkled and swept, giving him water to cool his feet. Meanwhile girlbruised fragrant rice, dried it little at time in sun, turned itrepeatedly, and beat it with hollow cane on firm flat spot, very gently, soas to separate grain without crushing husk. Then she said to thenurse, ‘Mother, goldsmiths cn make good use of these husks for polishingjewellery. Take them, and, with coppers you get for them, buy somefirewood, not too green and not too dry, small cooking pot, and twoearthen dishes. ‘28“When this was done she put grains of rice in shallowwidemouthed, round-bellied mortar, and took long and heavy pestle ofacaciawood, its head shod with plate of iron. … With skill and grace sheexerted her arms, as grains jumped up and down in mortar.

Repeatedly she stirred dm and pressed dm down with her fingers; then
she shook grains in winnowing basket to remove beard, rinsed
them several times, worshipped hearth, and placed dm in water which had been five times brought to boil. When rice softened, bubbledand swelled, she drew embers of fire together, put lid on thecooking pot, and strained off gruel. Then she patted rice with ladleand scooped it out little at time; and when she found that it wasthoroughly cooked she put cooking pot on one side, mouth downward.
Next she damped down those sticks which were not burnt through, andwhen fire was quite out she sent dm to dealers to be sold ascharcoal, saying, ‘With coppersthatyouget for them, buy as much asyou cn of green vegetables, ghee, curds, sesamum oil, myrobalans andtamarind.’“When this was done she offered him few savouries. Next she put therice-gruel in new dish immersed in damp sand, and cooled it with softbreeze of palm-leaf fan. She added little salt, and flavoured it with thescent of embers; she ground myrobalans to smooth powder, untilthey smelt like lotus; and then, by lips of nurse, she invited him totake bath. This he did, and when she too had bathed she gave him oil andmyrobalans [as an unguent].

“After he had bathed he sat on bench in paved courtyard, which had
been thoroughly sprinkled and swept. She stirred gruel in two
dishes, which she set before him on piece of pale green plantain leaf, cutfrom tree in courtyard. He drank it and felt rested and happy, relaxedin every limb. Next she gave him two ladlefuls of boiled rice, servedwith little ghee and condiments. She served rest of rice [Page 446]with curds, three spices [mace, cardamom and cinnamon], and fragrant andrefreshing buttermilk and gruel. He enjoyed meal to last mouthful.

“When he asked for drink she poured him water in steady streamfrom spout of new pitcher-it was fragrant with incense, and smelt offresh trumpet-flowers and perfume of full-blown lotuses. He put thebowl to his lips, and his eyelashes sparkled with rosy drops as cool as snow;his ears delighted in sound of trickling water; his rough cheeksthrilled and tingled at its pleasant contact; his nostrils opened wide at itssweet fragrance; and his tongue delighted in its lovely flavour, as he drankthe pure water in great gulps. Then, at his nod, girl gave him amouthwash in another bowl. old woman took away remains of hismeal, and he slept awhile in his ragged cloak, on pavement plasteredwith fresh cowdung.

“Wholly pleased with girl, he married her with due rites, and took her
home. Later he neglected her awhile and took mistress, but wife
treated her as dear friend. She served her husband indefatigably, as shewould god, and never neglected her household duties; and she won theloyalty of her servants by her great kindness. In end her husband was soenslaved by her goodness that he put whole household in her charge,made her sole mistress of his life and person, and enjoyed three aims oflife-virtue, wealth and love. So I maintain that virtuous wives make theirlords happy and virtuous.”39Subandhu, next of three great prose writers, is known only fromone work, called after its heroine Vdsavadattd, which tells of thevicissitudes of her love for prince Kandarpaketu. Unlike Dandin,Subandhu was quite unable to tell story, and had no sense of character.

His merits lie in his ornate descriptions and his mastery of language, and his
work consists of series of descriptive tableaux, linked by thin thread ofnarrative, each long description told in single sentence which covers twoor more pages of type. work abounds in flowers of speech of all kinds-puns, doubles entendres, alliterations and assonances, and is typicalexample of Gauda ( Bengali) style of literary composition, asdistinguished from simpler Vaidarbha ( Berar) style, with shorter, lessinvolved sentences, employed by Kālidasā and Dandin. It cannot beenjoyed in translation and its merits r only apparent in framework ofits own standards. Of European literature perhaps Lily’s Euphues andsimilar late Renaissance prose works most closely approach it in style andspirit.
Bana’s style is similar to that of Subandhu, but his work is much morevital and congenial to Western taste. Not only do his elaborate descriptionsshow accurate and close observation, but throughout his two works, the“Deeds of Harsa” ( Harsacarita) and Kddambarn, personality of theauthor breaks through. In former [Page 447] work, moreover, he givesus fragment of autobiography unparalleled in Sanskrit literature. Bāna wasborn of well-to-do brahman family, and his mother died in his earlychildhood. At age of fourteen he lost his father also, and, after periodof mourning, he began to sow his wild oats. He names with evidentaffection bosom friends of his dissolute youth, which was spent in
wandering from city to city among intellectual bohemians of time.

His circle was remarkably wide, including ascetics of various sects, bothorthodox and otherwise, literary men, actors, musicians, entertainers,doctors, and even humble people of low caste. list of Bana’s friends,mentioned in no special order, is in itself sufficient to show how lightly therules of caste weighed on educated man. author gives us no detailsof his adventures, but it would seem that in course of dm he wasreceived at court of Harsa, whom he offended in some way. Later hereturned for while to his home, and resumed peaceful life of countrybrahman; but soon message came from Harsa, demanding his attendanceat court. He was at first received coldly, but afterwards was restored tofavour.

Though religiously minded, Bāna seems throughout his life to have
transcended bounds of orthodoxy and to hv retained some of theunconventionality of his wild youth. He was not afraid to put forwardopinions which might hv made him unpopular with his royal patron —forinstance he condemned doctrine of royal divinity as gross sycophancy,and attacked Macchiavellian system of statecraft associated with thename of Kautilya as immoral and inhuman. Here and there in his workoccur passages which show implicit sympathy with poor and humble-asentiment rarely found in ancient Indian literature-and he is master ofexact observation. For all floweriness of his style Bāna’s outlook hasmore in common with that of 20th century than that of any other earlyIndian writer.
Of his two works “Deeds of Harsa” tells of events leading up toHarsa’s rise to power with general authenticity, but with some evidentexaggeration, and with lack of circumstantial detail which historianfinds irritating. work was apparently unfinished, since when itconcludes hero’s destiny is still somewhat in doubt. Kādambarī isperhaps conscious and successful attempt to improve on Subandhu’sVāsavadattā. story is romance, told in series of narrated episodeswhich link together to build upacomplicatedplot.This work also wasunfinished, and was completed by author’s son, whose prentice hand isquite evident.As an example of Bāna’sstylewegiveasomewhatabridged and adaptedversion of his description of Harsa’s army striking camp to march againsthis enemies. In original whole consists of [Page 448] singlesentence, basisof which is phrase “the royal court was filled withchieftains” near end of passage. separate sentences or clauses ofour translation r single compound words in original.‘“Then it was time to go. drums rattled, kettledrums beatjoyfully, trumpets blared, horns blew, conches sounded. Bydegrees hubbub of camp grew louder. Officers busily roused theKing’s courtiers. sky shook with din of fast-hammering mallets anddrumsticks. generals assembled ranks of subordinate officers.The darkness of night was broken by glare of thousand torcheswhich people lighted. Lovers were aroused by tramping feet of thewomen who kept watch. harsh shouts of elephant-marshalsdispelled slumber of their drowsy riders as awakened elephants left theirstables.

“Squadrons of horses woke from sleep and shook their manes. camp resounded loudly as spades dug up tent-pegs, and tethering chains of elephants clinked as their stakes were pulled up. … As foragers released elephants all space was filled with clanking of their fetters. Leather bags full to bursting were placed on their dusty backs, which had been rubbed down with tufts of hay. Servants rolled up canvasses andawnings of tents and pavilions, and bundles of tent-pegs were storedaway in bulging leather sacks. Store-keepers assembled their stores, andmany elephant-drivers loaded them. dwellings of vassals werecluttered with cups and cooking utensils, which were lifted on to backsof elephants, steadied by their riders. soldiers laughed as fatstrumpets were dragged away by force, resisting vigorously with feet andhands. many mighty and savage elephants trumpeted, as girthbandsof their bright harness were tightened, and restricted freedom of theirlimbs. …. Camels neighed in annoyance as sacks were loaded on their
backs.

“The wives of highborn gentlemen were visited in their carriages by gobetweens sent by princes. Elephant-captains, who had forgotten that itwas time to go, looked for their servants. splendid horses of King’sfavourites were led by footmen wealthy with their masters’ gifts. Troops ofhandsome warriors adorned their bodies with circles of unguent, scentedwith camphor. harness of marshals’ horses was hung with bags ofsalted peas, little bells, and whistles. 29 Monkeys sat among troops ofhorses, as grooms straightened their tangled reins. Stablemen draggedsacks of musty fodder for horses’ morning meal. calls of thegrasscutters grew louder and louder. There was uproar in stables asyounghorses strained and reared and swerved at confusion of starting.Girls hurried at call of riders of harnessed horses with unguentsfor their faces. As elephants and horses set out poor folk of the[Page 449] neighbourhood ran up to loot remains of heaped grain.
Donkeys plodded on together, loaded with piles of clothing. trampledroads were filled with carts with creaking wheels. Oxen were loaded withequipment which would suddenly fall off. strong oxen, first to bedriven away, lagged behind, drawn by grass which grew by theroadside.

“In front went field-kitchens of chief vassals. Standard bearers led ranks. As troops left their small huts hundreds of their friends came out to meet them. feet of elephants trampled hovels by roadside, and people came out and threw clods at their keepers, who called on bystanders to witness their assaults. Poor families ran fromtheir wrecked and ruined huts. Oxen, bearing wealth of unfortunatemerchants, fled from hubbub. Clearing path through crowd withthe glare of their torches, runners led way for elephants bearing thewomen of harem. Horsemen shouted to dogs running behind them.

The veterans praised tall Tangana horses, which trotted so smoothly and quickly that they made travelling pleasure. Unhappy Southerners upbraided their fallen mules. whole world was swallowed in dust.

“The royal court was filled with chieftains who had come from everyquarter, riding on cow-elephants, whose drivers bore bows adorned withstripes of gold-leaf. Seated within [the howdahs] their batmen carried theirswords. Their betel-bearers fanned dm with flywhisks. soldiers seatedin rear bore bundles of javelins in cases. trappings [of theelephants] bristled with curved sabres and gilded arrows. … thighs [ofthe chieftains] were clothed in fine-patterned silk, but their legs werecovered with mud-stained trousers. … Their tunics were decked with darkjewels, which glistened against their bodies. They wore Chinese cuirasses,doublets adorned with bright clusters of pearls. … and scarves as bright as aparrot’s wing. All ends of earth were filled with knights andwarriors, who hurried on with tossing shields and plumes. ends ofheaven were loud with jingling golden ornaments on harness of theprancing Kamboja steeds in their hundreds. ear was deafened by theharsh booming of hundreds of large kettledrums, mercilessly beaten. Theroll was called. With upturned faces footmen awaited order tomarch.” 40After Bāna similar prose romances were often written, as well as storiesin mixed prose and verse ( campū), but none is of much literary importance,and most r derivative, pedantic and dull.

Another branch of prose narrative literature was fable, which we meetfirst in Pāli Jātakas. These cheerful little stories, whose characters areoften talking animals, hv much in common with fables popular inancient Greece, and there has been some discussion on question ofinfluence. Direct borrowing is unlikely, though it may be that some of thetales were derived from common source in ancient Middle East.

Whatever origin of these stories Indian folklore did influence theliterature of West, for one of most [Page 450] famous Indiancollections of fables, Paicatantra, was translated into Pahlavl, or MiddlePersian, in 6th century. Thence it was translated into Syriac, and thenceagain, in 8th century, into Arabic. In various versions it appeared in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and found its way all over Europe. earliestEnglish version is that of Sir Thomas North, called “The MorallPhilosophie of Doni” after name of translator of Italian version,which North used. This appeared in 1570, and was earliest work ofIndian literature ( much garbled by successive translations) to be publishedin English. fables of La Fontaine r admittedly based on “Pilpay”, theform in which Vidyapati, title of Indian sage who is said to havenarrated stories, reached Europe. As well as fables of La Fontainethe stories of Reynard Fox, popular in folk literature of many partsof Europe and given finished form by Goethe, owe much to this source.

Other Indian tales, including several from Brhatkatha ( p. 429), found their way westwards, and “Arabian Nights” owes several of its stories and themes to India, including some of marvels met by Sindbad Sailor.

The Pañcatantra ( “Five Treatises” ) is in theory book of instruction inniti, or conduct of one’s affairs, especially intended for kings andstatesmen. little stories r contained in framing narrative which tellshow king was distressed at evil and stupidity of his sons, and entrustedthem to sage who reformed dm in six months by telling dm series offables. book exists in several versions of varying length and merit, mostly in prose, but with many verses of gnomic type. most famousof these versions is Narayana’s Hitopadeśa ( ” Salutary Instruction” ),composed in Bengal in 12th century. work was intended as a“reader” for students of Sanskrit, and serves that purpose well down to thepresent day. Never was school textbook better written. author wascompelled by his purpose to avoid euphuisms and pedantries whichaffected most of literature of his time, and he wrote lucidly and wittily,liberally including memorably terse gnomic stanzas. Ethically many of thestories r dubious, for they encourage caution and self-interest rather thanaltruism. two stories we quote r boxed within others.

‘It is said:
He who takes well-spoken knave
to be man of his own stamp
is fooled by rogues, like brahman
who was robbed of his goat.’
‘How did that happen?’ asked King.

[Page 451] ‘In forest of Gautama,’ said Meghavarna, ‘there lived brahman famous for his sacrifices. Once he went to village and bought goat for sacrifice, and as he was carrying it home on his shoulder he wasseen by three rogues. “If we could find way to get that goat,” they said tothemselves, “it would be fine trick!” So they stationed themselves eachunder tree about krośa apart. As brāhman passed by, first roguesaid, “Why, brāhman, that’s dog you’re carrying on your back!” “It’s not adog,” replied brahman,” it’s goat for sacrifice!”‘Then next rogue addressed him with same words. This time thebrāhman put goat on ground and looked at it hard, and again slung itover his shoulder and went on, his mind wavering like swing; forThe words of rogues make even mind of good man waver.

If he trusts dm he dies like Pretty-ears.’
‘How did that happen?’ asked King.

‘In forest land,’ he said,’ there lived lion named Madotkata, who had three servants, crow, tiger and jackal. Once as three were out walking they met camel, and they asked him whence he came, and whether he had fallen out of caravan. He told dm his story, and they took him back and handed him over to lion, who gave him his freedom and security; and he took name of Pretty-ears.

‘Later lion was taken ill, and there was heavy rain and they were very distressed for want of food. So they agreed so to arrange matters that their lord should kill Pretty-ears. “Of what other use,” they said to themselves, “is that eater of thorns to us?” “But how cn we manage it,”said tiger, “when our master has given him pledge of security and hashim in his favour?” “At time like this,” said crow, “when master isreduced to skin and bone, he won’t scruple at sin; forA woman torn by hunger will abandon her child.

A snake torn by hunger will eat its own eggs.

What evil will hungry man not do?

Lean men r always pitiless!

And, what is more,
A drunkard, an imbecile, lunatic,
a man tired out, an angry man, hungry man,
a greedy man, frightened man, hasty man,
or man in love never do right thing.”
‘After thus deliberating they all went to lion. “Have you found
anything to eat?” lion asked. “We’ve done our best,” they replied, “but
we haven’t found thing!” “Well,” said lion, “how r we to keep alive
now?” “Sire,” said crow, “if we don’t get our natural food we’ll all
surely die.” “And what,” asked lion, “is our natural food?” “Pretty-
ears!” whispered crow in lion’s ear.

[Page 452] ‘The lion touched earth and covered his ears in horror.

“We’ve given him pledge of security,” he said, “and we must stand by it.

How cn we eat him? For
Not gifts of land nor gifts of gold,
nor gifts of cattle nor gifts of food
are said to be greatest gift.

Of all gifts greatest is gift of safety.

Moreover
The merit of horse-sacrifice,
the fulfilment of all desires,
comes to man who protects
those who take refuge with him.”
‘“True!” said crow. “Our lord must not kill him. But there’s no
reason why we shouldn’t so arrange things that he offers his body
voluntarily.” At this lion kept silence. So when suitable occasion
offered crow found pretext to bring dm all into lion’s presence.

“Sire,” he said, “however hard we try we cn find no food. Your Majesty is
weak from days of fasting. So now make meal of my flesh, for
All subjects r dependent on their lord.

Only well-rooted trees bear fruit,
and only when king is strong
do men’s works prosper.”
“‘“I’d rather die myself than do such thing!” said lion.

“‘Then jackal made same offer. “Never!” lion replied.

‘The tiger next spoke up. “Let my lord live on my own body!” he said.

“Such thing cn never be right!” lion replied.

‘Finally Pretty-ears, full of confidence, offered himself in same way.

And, in accordance with his offer, lion ripped his belly open and they all
ate him up.

‘And that is why I say:
The words of rogues make even mind of good man waver. If he trusts
them he dies like Pretty-ears.

‘Meanwhile brāhman met third rogue, who spoke to him in the
same way. This time he decided that his senses were defective. So he

abandoned goat, took ritual ablution, and went home, while roguestook goat away and ate it. And so I say:He who takes well-spoken knaveto be man of his own stampis fooled by rogues like brahman who was robbed of his goat.’” 41[Page 453] Pali LiteratureThe Pali language was closer to speech of ordinary man than wasSanskrit, and its style was in general simpler; but though they contain manyfine passages Pali scriptures r largely prosaic and repetitive. samestock phrases and descriptions, often quite lengthy, occur again and againwith dull monotony which cn only be circumvented by drasticabridgement. Yet narrative portions of Pali canon r frequently ofmuch merit. Here for instance, somewhat abridged, is an account of theBuddha’s “Great Going Forth”, passage of intense dramatic force.

“Then lovely women, decked like damsels of gods with every kind of ornament and well trained in dance and song, began to perform. Butthe Bodhisattva had no taste for dancing, and for while sleep overcamehim. women thought: ‘He for whose sake we danced and sang hasfallen asleep-why should we trouble ourselves further?’ And they put uptheir instruments and lay down. lamps of scented oil burned on.

“The Bodhisattva awoke and sat cross-legged on his couch. He saw women with their instruments laid aside, fast asleep. Saliva trickled from mouths of some; some were covered in sweat; some ground their teethin sleep; some snored; garments of some were in disarray, so that theyrepulsively showed their private parts. When he saw dm thus in theirdishevelment he was more than ever disgusted with life of passion. Thegreat hall, decked like heavenly palace of Indra, seemed to him like charnel ground full of scattered corpses. Life seemed as fleeting as houseon fire. ‘How wretched it all is! How afflicted it all is!!’ he cried, and hismind was set even more strongly on asceticism. ‘Today I must leave on theGreat Going Forth,’ he thought, and he rose from his bed and went to thedoor.

“There lay Channa, his head on threshold. ‘Today I must go forth on Great Going Forth,’ he said, ‘get ready my horse’. … When he had thus sent Channa he thought ‘I will see my son’, and he went to apartments of Mother of Rahula, and opened bedroom door. little lamp ofscented oil burned in inner room. Mother of Rahula was sleepingon bed thickly strewn with flowers, with her son’s head on her arm. TheBodhisattva set one foot on threshold and stood gazing at them. ‘If Imove her hand and take up my son I shall waken queen,’ he thought,‘and then I shall not be able to go. When I am Buddha I will come backand see my son.’ And he left palace.”42As further example of Pali prose we give Jataka tale. This story,inculcating fickleness of women, has of course no religious value, andits origin is certainly secular, but we give its framework, in order that thereader may see how most unpromising material has been pressed intoservice for religious purposes. This story is typical of terse dry style ofthe collection, and of tales of [Page 454] marvels which were verypopular in India then as now. reader will recall that verses r theoriginal, round which story itself is built as sort of commentary.

“The Master, who was living at Jeta’s Grove at time, told this story in connexion with backsliding brother. Master asked him if he wanted toreturn to world and regretted taking orders. ‘It’s all because of wilesof women.’ monk answered. ‘Brother,’ said Master, ‘it’s impossibleto keep on your guard against women! Wise men of old couldn’t guardagainst them, even when they dwelt in realms of suparnas.’ 30 Andwhen brother pressed him Master told an old story. ‘In former timesKing Tamba ruled kingdom of BanĀras He had chief queen namedSussondi, woman of utmost beauty. Bodhisattva was born then asa suparna. At that time there was an island of serpents called Island ofSeruma. In that island Bodhisattva dwelt in palace of suparnas.

‘One day he went to Banāras in human guise, and gambled with KingTamba. attendants saw how fair he was, and told Sussondi that ahandsome man was gambling with King. She wanted to see him, so oneday she put on all her ornaments and came to gambling-hall, where,standing among her maids, she watched him. And then he saw Queen.

The two fell in love with one another. King of Suparnas stirred up magic wind in city, and everyone rushed from royal palace, fearing that it might fall. With his magic power he created darkness, seized Queen, and flew to his palace in Isle of Serpents.

‘Nobody knew where Sussondi had gone, but Suparna took hispleasure of her and went back to play with King. Now King had aminstrel named Sagga. Not knowing what had happened to Queen hesaid to minstrel, “Go and seek over land and sea, and find out where theQueen has gone.” So he took money for his journey and, starting in thesuburbs, he sought everywhere until he came to Bhrgukaccha. Just thensome merchants of Bhrgukaccha were setting out by ship for Land ofGold ( ? Burma). He went up to dm and said, “I’m minstrel. If you’llremit my fare and take me with you I’ll make music for you.” They agreed,took him aboard, and set sail.

‘When ship was well under way they called him to make music forthem. “I’d willingly make music for you,” he said, “but if I did fishwould leap out of water and smash your ship”. “When mere manmakes music fish don’t get excited,” they said, “so tune up!” “Thendon’t blame me for anything that may happen,” he said, and he tuned hislute and made music, with strings and voice in perfect unison. fishheard sound, and leapt with excitement. Then sea-monster ( makara)leapt from sea, fell on ship, and smashed it to pieces. Sagga lay on aplank and drifted with wind to Isle of Serpents, and landed by abanyan tree near palace of King of Suparnas.

‘Now King of Suparnas had gone away to play dice, and so [Page455] Queen Sussondi had come down from palace and was walking onthe shore; and she saw and recognized Sagga minstrel, and asked himhow he came. He told her all his story. She told him not to be afraid, andcomforted him, and clasped him in her arms, and had him taken to thepalace, where she laid him on couch. When he was revived she gave himfine food, bathed him in sweetly scented water, dressed him in fine clothes,adorned him with beautiful fragrant flowers, and again made him rest on thefine couch. So she cared for him, and whenever King of Suparnasreturned she hid him; then, as soon as he went again, she took passionatepleasure with him.

‘When month and half month had passed, merchants from Banāras
landed on that island at foot of banyan tree in search of fuel and
water. He boarded their ship, went back to Banāras, and saw King while
he was gambling. Then he took his lute, and, making music, sang first
stanza:
“There blows scent of timira trees
with sounding of evil sea,
but Sussondi is far away.

Tamba, desires torment me!”
‘When he heard this, Suparna sang second stanza:
“How did you cross ocean?

How came you to see Seruma?

How was it, Sagga,
that she and you did meet?”
‘Then Sagga sang three stanzas:
“From Bhrgukaccha there sailed
traders in search of wealth.

A monster broke their ship.

I floated on plank.

“In her soft and tender lap
ever fragrant with sandal
the gentle lady pillowed me,
as mother her own son.

“This you should know, King Tamba,
the fair-eyed lady gave me
food with her own hands,
and drink, and raiment, and bed.”
‘Even as minstrel sang Suparna was filled with regret. “Though I
dwelt in Palace of Suparnas,” he thought, “I could not keep her!

What is wanton to me?” So he brought her back, gave her to King,
and went away. And he never came again.’
“When story was over Master declared Four Noble Truths ( p.

269), and identified births. … ‘Ananda ( p. 261) was King o,
Banaras, and I was King of Suparnas.’” 43
[Page 455] As examples of Pali poetry we give few verses from the
“Songs of Elder Monks and Nuns” ( Theragāthā and Therāgāthā), a
collection of poems ascribed, falsely no doubt, to great disciples of the
Buddha in early days of Order. style of these poems is simpler
than that of courtly Sanskrit literature, and suggests influence of popular
song. first is attributed to Ambapālī, beautiful courtezan of Vaisali
who became Buddhist nun.

“Black and glossy as bee and curled was my hair;
now in old age it is just like hemp or bark-cloth.

Not otherwise is word of truthful. …
“My hair clustered with flowers was like box of sweet perfume;
now in old age it stinks like rabbit’s pelt.

Not otherwise is word of truthful …
“Once my eyebrows were lovely, as though drawn by an artist;
now in old age they r overhung with wrinkles.

Not otherwise is word of truthful. …
“Dark and long-lidded, my eyes were bright and flashing as jewels;
now in old age they r dulled and dim.

Not otherwise is word of truthful. …
“My voice was as sweet as cuckoo’s, who flies in woodland
thickets;
now in old age it is broken and stammering.

Not otherwise is word of truthful. …
“Once my hands were smooth and soft, and bright with jewels and
gold;
now in old age they twist like roots.

Not otherwise is word of truthful. …
“Once my body was lovely as polished gold;
now in old age it is covered all over with tiny wrinkles.


Not otherwise is word of truthful. …
“Once my two feet were soft, as though filled with down;
now in old age they r cracked and wizened.

Not otherwise is word of truthful. …
“Such was my body once. Now it is weary and tottering,
the home of many ills, an old house with flaking plaster.

Not otherwise is word of truthful.”44
Few ancient Indian poems show such deep love of nature as some of
these verses, ascribed to pious monks of 5th century B.C.

[Page 457] “When drum of clouds thunders in heaven,
and all ways of birds r thick with rain,
the monk sits in hills in ecstasy
and finds no joy greater than this.

“When by rivers covered with flowers,
and gaily adorned with reeds of varied hue,

“When crane with clear pale wing

“Freed from fear of flocks of cranes

This is no time to leave hills and streams!

Safe, good and pleasant is Ajakaranā.” 46 As an example of Pali descriptive poetry we give stirring passage from Ceylon Chronicle, Mahāvamsa, describing capture of Vijitanagara, capital of Tamil invader Elara, by Sinhalese national hero, King Dutthagamani ( 161–137 B.C. ), with aid of his favourite elephant, Kandula.

“The city had three moats,
and was guarded by high wall.

Its gate was covered with iron
hard for foes to shatter.

“The elephant knelt on his knees
and, battering with his tusks
stone and mortar and brick,
he attacked iron gate.

[Page 458] “The Tamils from watch-tower
threw missiles of every kind,
balls of red-hot iron
and [vessels of] molten pitch.

“Down fell smoking pitch
upon Kandula’s back.

In anguish of pain he fled
and plunged in pool of water.

‘This is no drinking bout!’
cried Gothaïmbara.

‘Go, batter iron gate!

Batter down gate!!’
“In his pride best of tuskers
took heart and trumpeted loud.

He reared up out of water
and stood on bank defiant.

“The elephant-doctor washed away
the pitch, and put on balm.

The King mounted elephant
and rubbed his brow with his hand.

‘Dear Kandula, I’ll make you
the lord of all Ceylon!’
he said, and beast was cheered,
and was fed with best of fodder.

“He was covered with cloth,
and he was armoured well
with armour for his back
of seven-fold buffalo hide.

“On armour was placed
a skin soaked in oil.

Then, trumpeting like thunder,
he came on, fearless of danger.

“He pierced door with his tusks.

With his feet he trampled threshold.

And gate and lintel
crashed loudly to earth.” 47


[Page 459]
## Prākrit Literature
Space will not permit more than brief reference to Prakrit scripturesof Jainas, examples of which we hv already quoted ( p. 293f). Ingeneral they hv little literary value. Like Jainism itself they tend to bearid, and, like Pali scriptures but in even greater measure, they repeatlengthy stock phrases and descriptions, which may hv had somemnemonic value, but which to modern reader r very irritating.Lengthy descriptions of Tirthaskaras, of pious monks, mighty kings,wealthy merchants, prosperous cities etc. occur over and over again, inexactly same words throughout canon, and give it flavour ofuninspired dryness. style is somewhat more ornate than that of Paliscriptures, and closer to courtly Sanskrit.The poetry of Jainas is better than their prose. In this connexion wecannot refrain from quoting remarkable poem, which is one of mosthumorous things in ancient Indian literature, and which, by some luckychance, has found its way into Jaina canon, among austere pages ofthe Sutrakrtānga. It is intended as warning of grim fate in store for thebacksliding monk, and throws most unexpected light on one aspect ofIndian marriage. Our translation is rather free, but we hv tried to keepsome of lively vernacular style of original.

“A celibate monk shouldn’t fall in love,
and though he hankers after pleasure he should hold himself in
check,
for these r pleasures
which some monks enjoy.

“If monk breaks his vows,
and falls for woman,
she upbraids him and raises her foot to him,
and kicks him on head.

‘Monk, if you won’t live with me
as husband and wife,
I’ll pull out my hair and become nun,
for you shall not live without me!’
“But when she has him in her clutches
it’s all housework and errands!

‘Fetch knife to cut this gourd!’
‘Get me some fresh fruit!’
“‘We want wood to boil greens,
and for fire in evening!’
‘Now paint my feet!’
‘Come and massage my back!’…
[Page 460] “‘Get me my lip-salve!’
‘Find my sunshade and slippers!’
‘I want knife to cut this string!’
‘Take my robe and hv it dyed blue!’…
‘Fetch me my tweezers and my comb!’
‘Get me ribbon to tie my hair!’
‘Now pass me my looking-glass!’
Put my toothbrush down beside me!’…
‘Fetch pot and drum and rag-ball,
for our little boy to play with!’
‘Monk, rains r on way,
patch roof of house and look to stores!’
‘Bring me chair with twine seat,
and my wooden-soled slippers to go out walking!’
So pregnant women boss their husbands,
just as though they were household slaves.

“When child is born, reward of their labours,
she makes father hold baby.

And sometimes fathers of sons
stagger under their burdens like camels.

“They get up at night, as though they were nurses,
to lull howling child to sleep,
and, though they r shamefaced about it,
scrub dirty garments, just like washermen. …
“So, monks, resist wiles of women,
avoid their friendship and company.

The little pleasure you get from them
will only lead you into trouble!” 48
A number of medieval works of secular nature were written in Prakrit,
chief of which r poems “The Building of Causeway”
( Setubandha), describing Rama’s invasion of Ceylon and falsely ascribed to
Kālidasā; “The Slaying of King of Bengal” ( Gausavadha), long
panegyric by 8th-century poet Vakpati, describing exploits of
Yasovarman, king of Kānyakubja ( p. 70); and drama named after its
heroine, Karpūiramañjarī, by 10th-century dramatist Rājaśekhara. These
works, though not without merit, r indistinguishable in style and content
from comparable Sanskrit productions, and need not detain us.

[Page 461] most important literary work in Prākrit is “SevenHundred” ( Saptasataka) of Hala. This is large collection of selfcontainedstanzas of great charm and beauty, in Āryā metre ( p. 51 If). Theirtraditional author was shadowy Sātavāhana king Hala, who ruled in theDeccan in 1st century A.D., but in fact many of these verses seemconsiderably later, and they must be looked on as anonymous. They arenotable for their conciseness; like Amaru, their authors were able to suggesta whole story in four short lines. This great economy of words and masterlyuse of suggestion would indicate that verses were written for highlyeducated literary audience; but they contain simple and natural descriptionsand references to lives of peasants and lower classes, which point topopular influence. treatment of love affairs of country folk remindsus of early Tamil poetry, and suggests that “Hāla” may hv tapped awidely diffused source in South Indian folksong.

“Last night with scorn lady gave wanderer
straw for his bed.

This morning she gathers it together,


weeping.”
‘This morning, my friend, I heard man singing,
and his song reminded me of my lover,
and opened all wounds
that shafts of Love-god had made in my heart.’”
“‘Waiting for you, first half of night
passed like moment.

The rest was like year,
for I was sunk in grief.’”
“When season of rains, with its high clouds, 31
has passed like youth,
the earliest single kāsa flower
comes, like grey hair on earth.”
‘Ungrateful lover, still I see mud
in village street,
which, on rainy night,
I trod for your sake, shameless one!’”49
Tamil Literature
The oldest Tamil literature goes back to early centuries of the
Christian era. Its dating is still matter of some dispute but it [Page 462]
seems almost certain that earliest stratum was composed before the
great Pallava dynasty of Kāncī became dominant in Tamil Land in the
6th century, and it is probably some centuries older than this.

Tamil tradition tells of three literary academies ( śangam) which met at Madurai. earliest of these was attended by gods and legendary sages, and all its works hv perished. Of second, there survives only early Tamil grammar, Tolkāppiyam. poets of Third Śangam, on other hand, wrote “Eight Anthologies” ( Ettutogai), which r greatest monument of ancient Tamil literature, as well as number of later works.

Some authorities hv doubted tradition of Śangams, and it is almost
certain that grammar Tolkāppiyam, attributed to Second Śangam, is
later than many of poems of Third. But tradition of an —gams, which is strongly held one, has no parallel in Northern legend, andwe may believe that bards of Tamil Land, who wandered over thecountry enjoying patronage of chieftains and villagers alike, would meetfrom time to time in city of Madurai for great festivals of poetry andmusic, and that many of verses of Anthologies were recited there.

The poetry of “Eight Anthologies” is little known outside land of
its origin, and its language is so archaic that modern educated Tamil cannot read it without special study. relation of language of theŚangam literature to Tamil as it is now written is perhaps similar to that ofPiers Plowman to modern English. tradition of Tamil poetry at timeof composition of these works must already hv been long one, forthe poetic conventions finally fixed in Tolkāppiyam had almost reached their finished form even in earliest poems of Anthologies. But theirstyle is much nearer that of folk literature than is style of courtlySanskrit. life of peasant and scenes of countryside, thebustle of towns and ruthlessness of war, r here depicted as thoughfrom direct experience, and with no formal unrealistic idealization.

Together “Eight Anthologies “32 make up very large body of poeticliterature, and contain well over 2,000 poems, ascribed to more than 200authors. To dm must be added “The Ten Songs” ( Pattuppāttu), containingten longer poems of similar style but somewhat later date. Until end of last century this great collection was [Page 463] almost forgotten, evenby Tamils themselves; only within last fifty years hv raremanuscripts containing it been edited and given to world. Much is stilluntranslated, and full and thorough study of Śangam literature fromthe critical and historical point of view has yet to be made.

Very early Tamils developed passion for classification which is noticeable in many aspects of ancient Indian learning. Poetry was divided into two main groups: “internal” ( agam), dealing with love, and “external” ( puram), dealing with praise of kings. further division was made acc to region of Tamil Land to which poem referred orwas most appropriate. Conventionally there were five regions ( tinai): thehills ( kurinji), dry lands ( pālai), jungle and woodland ( mullai), thecultivated plains ( marudam), and coast ( neydal). Each was connectedwith some special aspect of love or war; thus hills were scene ofpoems on pre-nuptial love and cattle-raiding; dry lands, of longseparation of lovers, and of laying waste of countryside; jungle,of brief parting of lovers, and of raiding expeditions; valleys, ofpost-nuptial love or wiles of courtezans, and of siege; and seacoast,of parting of fishermen’s wives from their lords, and of pitched battle.

To each region were attributed its own appropriate flowers, animals and people. Every poem of “Eight Anthologies” was classified in one of five sections, but much of poetry was written with little regard for this formal classification.

A unique feature of Tamil poetry is initial rhyme or assonance. This
does not appear in earliest Tamil literature, but by end of the
Śangam period it was quite regular. first syllable, or syllables, of each
couplet must rhyme. Thus:
ISAITAD’ eninum iyarrior drrdl
AIrADu nirpadm dnmai; isaiyungal
KANDARirai alaikkuh kdnal an tan serppa
PENDIRum valaro marru.”
“Though you fail, to work and struggle,
unwaveringly steadfast-this is manliness.

Lord of cool and lovely shore, where waves shake thorny
groves!

Will not even women flourish in prosperity?’” 50 This initial assonance, in some poems continued through four or more lines, is never to be found in poetry of Sanskritic languages, or as far as we know, in that of any other language. Its effect, little strange at first, rapidly becomes pleasant to reader, and to Tamil is as enjoyable as end rhyme of European poetry.

[Page 464] We give brief anthology of short poems and extracts from
this wonderful literature. 33
Here mother tells of her son, who has gone to war.

“If you lean against pillar of my little home
and ask whereabouts of my son,
I reply, ‘I cannot tell you’.

Behold, like tiger’s cavern of rock,
the womb that bore him!

You will find him on field of war.”52
The three following poems r attributed to poetess Avvaiyar.

“It charms not like harp,
it accords not with time-beat,
it conveys no meaning,
but prattling of son
brings bliss to his father.

So, O King Nedumai Anji,
through grace of your favour
my empty words r imbued with meaning.

O King, you hv overcome enemy’s forts,
though unscaleable were their walls.”53
“To allow little children of village
to wash clean its white tusks,
the huge elephant will lie on river bank.

O great King, you favour me like that!

But to approach an elephant in rut is death,
and you r death to your foes, O King!” 54
Here Avvaiyar compares wealth of luxurious king of Tondai
( Kāncī) with that of her own warlike chief.

“Bedecked with peacock-feathers, garlanded with flowers,
fine r Tondai spears in spacious armoury,
with their strong shafts, and sharp points bright with ghee.

The weapons of my king r blunt with fighting,
broken their points through parrying thrusts of foe.

The swordsmith’s forge is busy with repairs.

My king, when rich, freely gives food away,
when poor he messes with his men.

He is head of family of poor,
yet great is he, with his sharp-pointed spear.”55
[Page 465] “O bee, fair of wing, ever in search of flower-garlands,
tell me not what I fain would hear, but what you really saw!

Among all flowers you know is any more fragrant
than tresses of my lady of close-set teeth?

Graceful as peacock she dwells, rich in love, with me!” 56
“Ever anew aches my heart!

Again and again I brush off burning tears.

My love, once peaceful at my side, grows restless.

My heart aches!”57
“In gathering night
hushed of speech all men sweetly sleep.

Devoid of wrath,
countless people in world r resting.

I alone sleep not!”58
Here mother asks an ascetic whereabouts of her daughter, who has
eloped with her lover. sage offers her this consolation:
“Save to wearer of its scent,
of what use is sandalwood tree,
even to mountains amid which it was born?

If you ponder matter, it is so with your daughter.

“Except to wearer of it
of what avail is highly prized white pearl,
even to sea in which it was reared?

If you ponder matter, it is so with your daughter.”59
Here girl speaks to her playmate:
“What bright bracelets you have! Do listen!

As I was playing in road
he kicked over my mud castle with his foot,
and snatched garland from my head,
and ran away with my striped ball.

How he teased me, naughty boy!

“Another day my mother and I
were together, when voice called out:
‘Whoever’s at home, please give me some water!’
Mother said to me: ‘My dear,
fill gilded vessel, and give him water to drink!’
I went out, not knowing who it was.

He caught my wrist, with bangles on, and squeezed it,
and I was frightened, and cried out:
[Page 466] ‘Mother, just look what he’s done!’
She was very upset, and hurried down,
but I told her he’d hiccups because of water.

He looked at me as if he could kill me,
but then rogue made friends with smile.”60
Here newly married girl makes her first attempts at cooking:
“Her fingers, slender as kandal blossom, had been squeezing new
curds.

Her clothes had not been washed since she wiped her fingers on them.

The appetizing steam had got into her lily-like eyes.

Yet, as she rubbed them, he just said, ‘The curry you’ve cooked is
delicious.’
He of bright brow was most pleased with what he was eating.”61
Striking touches of natural description often illumine rather
monotonous panegyrics:
“Though milk turn sour, though day turn to night,
though path of Vedas lead men astray,
may you stand unshaken, long famed, with loyal
supporters, that, in foothills of mountains,
the large-eyed mother doe with her small-headed fawn
may sleep secure at evening by flame of three fires
of hermits who perform hard penances.”62
“Unfailing in hard tasks of war,
O king, like death, for whom there is no cure,
though earth be moved from her place, your name is eternalyou,
whose legs wear golden anklets, whose broad breast
is spread with drying sandal-paste!

In an uninhabited land, land of bitter hardship,
a land without water, land of long tracks,
your valiant warriors fight, unerring in their archery,
gazing afar, with their hands hung over their eyes.

There, in silk-cotton tree, where roads diverge,
the eagle, with trim feathers and crooked beak,
wails over new cairns of those who hv shot their arrows.”63
Here girl consoles her lovelorn friend:
“‘The toiling fishermen catch shoals
in their close-meshed nets, and soft-headed prawn,
thin as cassia bud in forest.

“‘Like hunters who chase deer in woods
young fishermen chase in waste of waters
the saw-toothed shark, and return with meat.

[Page 467] “‘They return to shore and unload on sand,
where wind plays wild across saltpans,
and soon street of fishing village
will ring with wheels of your lover’s chariot.’”64
A young man praises his sweetheart’s cookery:
‘At every post before house
is tied gentle calf of crooked-horned buffalo.

There dwells my sweetheart, curving and lovely,
languid of gaze, with big round earrings,
and little rings on her tiny fingers.

“‘She has cut leaves of garden plantain
and split dm in pieces down stalk
to serve as platters for meal.

Her eyes r filled with smoke of cooking.

Her brow, as fair as crescent moon,
is covered now with drops of sweat.

She wipes it away with hem of her garment
and stands in kitchen, and thinks of me.

“‘Come in then, if you want good meal!

You’ll see her smile and show her tiny
sharp teeth, whom I long to kiss.’”65
A village festival:
“The farmers who harvest rice in hot sun
now leap into waves of clear sea.

The sailors, captains of stout craft,
drink strong liquor and dance for joy,
as they clasp bright-bangled hands of women
who wear garlands of clustering pusai. …
“In cool woods, where bees seek flowers,
women, bright-bangled and garlanded, drink
the juice of palm and pale sugar-cane,
and juice of coconut which grows in sand,
then running they plunge into sea.” 66
A poignant description of famine:
“The hearth has forgotten cooking:
It is overgrown with moss and mould.

The woman, thin with hunger,
has breasts like wrinkled bladders.

Their nipples r quite dry,
but child chews them, weeping.

She looks down at his face
and tears hang on her lashes.”67
[Page 468] Our final quotation from “Eight Anthologies” is plaint
of neglected wife:
“My garment smells of ghee and frying curry,
and is stained with dirt and lampblack.

“My shoulders stink with sweat of child


whom I carry upon dm and feed at my breast.

“I cannot face my lord, who, in gay attire,
rides in his car to street of harlots.” 68
The next stratum of Tamil literature shows much greater Aryan influence.

Āryan religious ideas and practices, not unknown even in Eight Anthologies, had by now been thoroughly grafted on to original Tamil heritage, and Jaina influence is prominent. “The Eighteen Minor Works”( Padinenkilkanakku) r largely gnomic and moralizing in character, thetwo most famous being Tirukkural, and Nāladiyār. former,sometimes called “Bible of Tamil Land” is series of brief metricalproverbs on many aspects of life and religion, and we hv already quoted some of its aphorisms ( p. 339). We add few others of more secular type.

“Vain is kingdom where r all good things
but no love between ruler and ruled.”

“Even hermit ceases his penance
if husbandman folds his arms.”

“Earth laughs in scorn
at those who plead poverty.”

“No food is sweeter than rice-gruel,
when you hv worked for it.”

“Wide as sea is joy of love,
but wider still sorrow of parting.”

“Love is stronger than wine,
for very thought of it intoxicates.”


“Sweethearts delight in lover’s quarrel
for greater delight of making it up.” 69
Ndla.diyar is more formal and literary in style, and contains verses of
much merit and high ethical content.

[Page 469] “Better hatred than friendship of fools.

Better death than chronic illness.

Better to be killed than soul-destroying contempt.

Better abuse than praise undeserved.”
“True housekeeping is to eat meal
sharing, as far as may be, with friend and foe alike.

The useless men who eat their food alone
will never pass gate of heaven.”
“Though you feed him with care from golden dish
a dog will always prefer carrion.

Though you deal with base as you would with good
their deeds will always show dm up.”
“Hillmen remember their lovely hills.

Farmers remember their fertile fields.

The good remember another’s kindness.

The base recall only fancied slights.”
“As scroll read by one who well understands it,
as wealth to man of generous spirit,
as sharp sword in warrior’s hand,
is beauty of faithful wife.”
“To those who once embraced their lovers
whose broad chests were hung with garlands,
when their loved ones r away
the thunder sounds like funeral drum.”70

By 6th century Āryan influence had penetrated whole of Tamil land, and her kings and chiefs worshipped and supported gods ofHinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. indigenous style of poetry wasrapidly altering under influence of Sanskrit, and Tamil poets took towriting long poems which they called by Sanskrit name kivya. Theearliest and greatest of these is “The Jewelled Anklet” ( Śilappadigāram),which is still very different from Sanskrit poetry. Though written for aneducated audience and in faultless literary style it is near to life of thepeople; it is by comparison realistic, dealing with lives of two ordinaryfolk enmeshed in unhappy circumstance, and, unlike Sanskrit courtly“epic”, it sounds note of true tragedy.

The traditional author of poem was Ilangovadigal, grandson of great Cola king Karikalan, who lived in 1st or 2nd century A.D. tradition is certainly false, and poem is several [Page 470] centurieslater. Its author, whoever he was, though great poet, was not greatstoryteller. His tale was well known to his hearers, and he could afford to be irritatingly allusive and terse in important narrative passages, and lingerlovingly over interesting description. He successfully drew together all thethemes of earlier Tamil poets and welded dm into whole, in theframework of story of luckless Kovalan and Kannagi. Rightly thispoem and Kamban’s Rdmdyanam r looked on as national Epics of theTamil people. We give an outline of story, with translation,considerably abridged, of its climax, which has grimly baroque force andsplendour, unparalleled elsewhere in Indian literature. It is imbued withboth ferocity of early Tamils and their stern respect for justice, and,incidentally, throws much light on character of early Tamil kingship.

Kovalan, son of wealthy merchant of city of Pugar or Kavirippattinam, married Kannagi, lovely daughter of another merchant. For some time they lived together happily, until, at festival at royal court, Kovalan, met dancer Madavi, and fell in love with her.

He bought her favours and in his infatuation forgot Kannagi and his home.

Gradually he spent all his wealth on dancer, even to Kannagi’s jewels.

At last he was penniless, and returned repentantly to his uncomplaining  wife. Their only fortune was precious pair of anklets, which she gave to him willingly. With these as their capital they decided to go to great city of Madurai, where Kovalan hoped to recoup his fortunes by trade.

On their arrival at Madurai they found shelter in cottage, and Kovalanwent to market, to sell one of Kannagi’s anklets. But queen ofNedunjeliyan, king of Pandyas, had just been robbed of similar ankletby wicked court jeweller. jeweller happened to see Kovalan withKannagi’s anklet, and immediately seized it and informed King. Guardswere sent to apprehend Kovalan, who was cut down immediately, withouttrial. When news was brought to Kannagi she fainted away; but shequickly recovered and, with her eyes ablaze with anger, she went out intothe town, carrying remaining anklet in her hand as proof of herhusband’s innocence.

‘Chaste women of Madurai, listen to me!

Today my sorrows cannot be matched.

Things which should never hv happened hv befallen me.

How cn I bear this injustice?’…
“All folk of rich city of Madurai
saw her, and were moved by her grief and affliction.

In wonder and sorrow they cried:
‘Wrong that cannot be undone has been done to this lady!

[Page 471] ‘Our King’s straight sceptre is bent!

What cn this mean?

Lost is glory of King Over Kings,
the Lord of Umbrella and Spear! …
‘A new and mighty goddess
has come before us,
in her hand golden anklet!

What cn this mean?

‘This woman afflicted and weeping
from her lovely dark-stained eyes
is as though filled with godhead!

What cn this mean?’
“Thus, raising loud accusing voices,
the people of Madurai befriended and comforted her,
and among tumultuous throng
some showed her her husband’s body.

“She, golden vine, beheld him,
but her he could not see. …
“Then red-rayed sun folded his fiery arms
and hid behind great mountain,
and wide world
was veiled in darkness.

“In brief twilight
Kanagi cried aloud
and whole city
echoed her wailing.

“In morning she had taken wreath from his neck
and decked her hair with its flowers;
in evening she saw him lying
in pool of his own blood.

“But he saw not agony of her grief
as she mourned in sorrow and wrath. …
[Page 472] ‘Are there women here? r there women
who could bear such wrong
done to their wedded lords?

Are there women here? r there such women?

‘Are there good men here? r there good men
who cherish their children
and guard dm with care?

Are there men here? r there such men?

‘Is there god here? Is there god
in this city of Madurai, where sword of king
has slain an innocent man?

Is there god here? Is there god?’
“Lamenting thus she clasped her husband’s breast,
and it seemed that he rose to his feet and said,
‘The full-moon of your face has faded,’
and he stroked her face with his hands.

“She fell to ground, sobbing and crying,
and clasped her lord’s feet with her bangled hands;
and he left behind his human form
and went, surrounded by gods.

“And, as he went, he said,
‘My darling, you must stay!’
‘Surely this
was vision,’ she cried.

‘I will not join my lord
till my great wrath is appeased!

I will see cruel King,
and ask for his explanation!’
“And she stood on her feet,
her large eyes full of tears,
and, wiping her eyes,
she went to gate of palace.

“I saw, alas, I saw in dream
the sceptre fall and royal umbrella.

The bell at palace gate rang of itself,
while whole heaven shook in confusion!

‘A darkness swallowed sun,
a rainbow glowed in night,
and burning meteor
crashed to earth by day.’


“Thus spoke Queen,
and took her maids and her bodyguard,
and went to King on lion-throne,
and told him her evil dream.

PLATE LXXXVII
[Page 473] “Then came cry from gate:
‘Ho, Gatekeeper! Ho, Gatekeeper!!

Ho, Gatekeeper of King who has lost wisdom,
whose evil heart has swerved from justice!!

‘Tell King that woman with an anklet,
an anklet from pair of tinkling anklets,
a woman who has lost her husband,
is waiting at gate.’
“And gatekeeper went to King and said:
‘A woman waits at gate.

She is not Korravai, goddess of victory,
with triumphant spear in her hand. …
‘Filled with anger, boiling with rage,
a woman who has lost her husband,
an anklet of gold in her hand,
is waiting at gate.’”
Kannagi was then admitted to King’s presence.

‘Cruel King, this I must say. …
‘My lord Kovalan came
to Madurai to earn wealth,
and today you hv slain him
as he sold my anklet.’
‘Lady,’ said King,
‘it is kingly justice
to put to death
an arrant thief.’”
Then Kannagi showed her anklet to King. On comparing it very
carefully with remaining anklet of pair belonging to Queen, he
realized that Kovalan had been innocent.

“When he saw it parasol fell from his head
and sceptre trembled in his hand.

‘I am no king,’ he said,
‘who hv heeded words of goldsmith.

‘I am thief. For first time
I hv failed to protect my people.

Now may I die!’
[And he fell to ground, dead. 3
[Page 474] Then Kannagi said to Queen:
‘If I hv always been true to my husband
I will not suffer this city to flourish,
but I will destroy it as King is destroyed!

Soon you will see that my words r true!’
“And with these words she left palace,
and cried out through city, ‘Men and women
of great Madurai of four temples,
listen! Listen you gods in heaven!

‘Listen to me, you holy sages!

I curse capital of King
who so cruelly wronged
my beloved lord!’
“With her own hand she tore left breast from her body.

Thrice she surveyed city of Madurai,
calling her curse in bitter agony.

Then she flung her fair breast on scented street. …
“And burning mouth of Fire-god opened
as gods who guarded city closed their doors. …
“The high priest, astrologer and judges,
the treasurer and learned councillors,
the palace servants and maids,
stood silent and still as painted pictures.

“The elephant-riders and horsemen,
the charioteers and foot-soldiers
with their terrible swords, all fled from fire
which raged at gate of royal palace. …
“And street of sellers of grain,
the street of chariots, with its bright-coloured garlands,
and four quarters of four classes
were filled with confusion and flamed like forest on fire. …
“In street of singing girls
where so often tabor had sounded
with sweet gentle flute and tremulous harp …
the dancers, whose halls were destroyed, cried out:
‘Whence comes this woman? Whose daughter is she?

A single woman, who has lost her husband,has conquered evil King with her anklet,and has destroyed our city with fire’”71[Page 475] At last patron goddess of city interceded withKannagi, and she agreed to withdraw her curse, and fire abated. Weakwith loss of blood from her self-amputated breast, Kannagi struggled to ahill outside city, where, after few days, she died, and was reunitedwith Kovalan in heaven. Meanwhile news of her death spreadthroughout Tamil Land. She was deified, and temples raised andfestivals held in her honour, and she became patron goddess of wifelyloyalty and chastity.

A little later than “The Jewelled Anklet” was composed its sequelManimigalai, attributed to poet Sattan of Madurai. Though by traditionit is earlier of two all other evidence suggests opposite, for itassumes reader’s knowledge of “The Jewelled Anklet”, to which it is asort of Buddhistic supplement. “The Jewelled Anklet”, though containingmany religious and moral lessons, was primarily written to tell story,while in Manimegalai story is mere framework for philosophicalpolemic, and atmosphere of narrative passages has some of theotherworldly formality of courtly Sanskrit kavya. heroine,Manimegalai, is daughter of Kovalan, hero of “The JewelledAnklet”, by dancer Madavi, who became Buddhist nun on hearing ofher former lover’s death. story tells of love of PrinceUdayakumaran -for Manimegalai, and miraculous preservation of herchastity. In end she becomes Buddhist nun like her mother, and mostof poem is taken up with her discussions with members of various sects,both Hindu and heterodox, and her triumphant refutation of their doctrines.A third Tamil “epic”, Sivaga-Sindimani, describes exploits of thehero Sivaga or Jivaka, superman who excels in every art from archery tothe curing of snake-bite, and who wins new bride for his harem with everyfeat, only to become Jaina monk after his many triumphs. author wasa Jaina, Tiruttakkadevar. His work is fantastic and lacking in any contactwith real life; its style is elegant and ornate, and much influenced by courtlySanskrit. It is definitely later than other two “epics”.By now Tamil poets were not satisfied with their own traditions, andtranslations and adaptations of many Northern works were made, mostnotable of which is Kamban’s Rāmāyanam, composed in 9th century.

This great poem is still known and loved in Tamil Land, and is by nomeans mere translation of original, for Kamban adapts themes as hethinks fit, and here and there adds episodes of his own. It is noteworthy thatin Kamban’s hands demon Ravan frequently takes on proportionsof heroic figure, and contrasts favourably with rather weak andunimpressive Rāma. Like Milton, Kamban was of devil’s party withoutknowing [Page 476] it. real glory of medieval Tamil literature,however, is undoubtedly hymns of Śaivite and Vaisnavite devotionalteachers, which r among great religious literature of world, andwhich we hv discussed and quoted in another connexion ( p. 330ff). Otherthan these, later Tamil literature produced little of first order.

The canon of Tamil saivites contains work of merit ( p. 334), but theadaptations of Puranas and lengthy commentaries on earlierliterature, though not unimportant, need not be discussed here. 34The early literatures of Canarese, Telugu and Malayalam, which hadbegun to be written before end of our period, r less important than thatof Tamil, and need not detain us. They originated at time when Āryaninfluence was already thoroughly entrenched, and, though containing manybeauties, lack originality of early Tamil poetry. Thus they cannot aspireto importance of Tamil, which cn claim one of longest unbrokenliterary traditions of any of world’s living languages.

## Folk Poetry
35
The literatures which we hv been discussing were all work of literary schools with formal conventions and long traditions. Some poetry,obviously, is less formalized than that of classical Sanskrit, and here andthere, notably in verses of Tamil anthologies and PrākritSaptaiataka, we seem to catch echoes of folk-song and popular oralliterature. No Indian writer, however, as far as we know, thought fit torecord folk-song of ancient India, which, if we r to judge by modemanalogy, must hv been plentiful and of high quality. But few verses havebeen preserved in Chinese translation, which may well be words ofgenuine folk-songs of pre-Gupta times.

That part of Buddhist canon called Samyutta NikSya ( p. 267) was first translated into Chinese about A.D. 440, from manuscript acquired in Ceylon by Fa-hsien in 411. At end of book occurs section which isnot to be found in Pali version as it exists at [Page 477] present, butwhich must hv been included in Fa-hsien’s manuscript. Probably theverses here quoted were sung in India between time of codificationof Pali canon in 1st century B.C. ( p. 266) and beginning of 5thcentury A.D.The passage in question describes monk, who hears singing ofvarious secular songs, and converts dm to Buddhist purposes bycomparatively slight alterations. Thus first verse quoted is capped by themonk with pious wish that he may gently flow to Nirvana, and so on.

The song of lady who got on badly with her “in-laws”:
“O river Ganges, all I now wantis to go with your waters that flow gently to sea;that never again by my father- and mother-in-lawI may at every turn be scolded and abused.”The song of melon-thief:“Bright moon, I beg you not to come out.

Wait where you r till I hv cut these melons.

But when I hv got my melons safely away,
then come out or not, just as you please.”
The song of poor man:
“So long as I own just one pig,
and single jar full of good wine,
one cup to pour wine into,
and someone to fill my cup again and again-
so long as I own just as much as that,
there is nothing else that bothers me at all.”
The song of girl who, going to tryst with her lover on rainy night,
slips and falls in mud:,
“The hair of my head is all loose and astray;
my lovely necklace has fallen in deep mud.

My rings and bracelets r all broken and spoiled;
when I come to my lover, what shall I give him to wear?”
The song of lover, picnicking with his mistress:
“With thoughts of love, all for our ease and pleasure,
we loiter under shade of green trees.

The running stream flows swift and clear,
the sound of my zither is very tuneful and sweet.

The spring weather is just right for our jaunt;
what happiness could there be greater than ours?”
[Page 478] Advice to dove:
“Dove, my bird, you must lay up your stores-
sesamum-seed, rice, millet and rest-
and take dm to tree on very top of hill,
and make yourself nest-cavern high and bright.

Then when Heaven sends rainy season
you will be sure of lodging, food and drink.”

8 Literally “a horse’s tail”, probably implying wisp of cloud.

9 exact meanings of several words and phrases of this hymn r quite uncertain. In translating I hv given sense which seems to me most probable, and filled out elliptical Sanskrit to make meaning clearer.

10 I.e. vibhidaka nuts, loosely translated “dice”. See p. 207f.

11 Literally “wealth”. It is almost certain that there was no coined money in India at time of this poem’s composition ( p. 220).

12 I.e. gambles with brown nuts.

13 Sitd means “furrow”, and heroine of epic has some of attributes of an agricultural goddess. acc to story she was not natural daughter of King Janaka, but sprang from his plough while he was working in fields. This story evidently looks back to time when tribal chieftain was ready to lend hand with work of tribe.

14 This rather grim ending to story did not satisfy some gentler spirits.

Bhavabhfuti’s Uttarardmacarita, drama of 8th century, concludes with full reconciliation of Rāma and Sītā.

16 most important and original literary theorists were Dandin ( p.

century), Anandavardhana ( Dhvanyśloka, 9th century), Mammata
( Kdvyaprakdsa, early 12th century), and Viśvanātha ( Sāhityadarpaza, 14th
century).

17 For further notes on Sanskrit prosody see Appendix, p. 508ff.

18 second line of original of this verse ( ” press on with faster
pace, having shed your load of water” ) is skilfully alliterated on the
consonant t, giving an impression of haste to slow metre and suggesting
the patter of raindrops:

toyotsarga-drutatara-gatis tatparam vartma tirzaz,
Revdm draksyasy upala-visame Vindhya-pdde visirnām,

19 mastery of language in last three stanzas quoted is so
remarkable that it must impress even reader who knows no Sanskrit.

With brilliant use of assonance and alliteration Kālidasā has wedded sound
to sense in way rarely achieved in literature of world.

22 rhyme scheme varies from lyric to lyric. Here second and fourth quarters end with rhyme of two syllables, while first and third quarters of each stanza end with same syllable. first and third quarters end in e throughout poem. refrain applies equally to love of Krsna for Rādhā and love of God for soul. We quote last verse so that reader may hv some idea of mellifluousness of original:
Bhanati kavi-Jayadeve
virahi-vilasitena
manasi rabhasa-vibhave
Harir udayatu sukrtena.

Tava virahe vanamali sakhi sidati.

23 Stories such as this puzzle social historian. If texts on Sacred Law hv any relation to real life it is quite incredible that girl of good class in 11th century should hv been given such freedom by her parents, or should even hv thought of legally marrying despised outcaste. story probably looks back to much earlier time, when social relations were very much freer.

24 simile is not unduly exaggerated, as dancer was covered with jewellery, which glittered in sunlight.

25 This convention of Indian stage was known to Goethe from Sir William Jones’ translation of Śakuntalā, and was adapted by him for prologue of Faust.

26 This stage direction is inserted by us. All others r Kālidasā’s. In their comparatively full stage directions Sanskrit plays contrast strikingly with those of ancient Greece.

27 Though fair complexion was much prized in ancient India trace of brownness in hair, fairly common in North, was thought very unbeautiful and inauspicious.

28 economics of this and other transaction referred to r very hard to explain. No doubt rice husks, so carefully threshed, had some commercial value, but it is hardly likely that it would hv bought wares mentioned. If this passage has any historical significance it confirms evidence of other sources that in ordinary times means of subsistence were plentiful and cheap.

29 Cowell and Thomas ( Harsacarita of Bdaa, p. 200) take lavanakalday as “wooden figures of deer” on basis of late commentary. Lavana means salt, and kalāya type of pea, and we believe compound to mean bag of salted peas, horse’s iron rations. Thetranslation of kikiti-ndli-sanatha as “bells with reeds attached” is equallyimprobable. horse’s harness would be hung with bells, but nālī, “reed”or “tube”, may well mean whistle attached to harness by cord, andused for signalling.

30 class of large mythical bird, of whom Garuda ( p. 300) is chief.

31 There is pun here on paohare, which may mean either “clouds” or
“breasts”.

32 Narrinai: 400 short poems on love, each of from nine to twelve lines; Kuruntośai, 400 love poems of from four to eight lines each; Aingurunuru, 600 short erotic poems; Padirruppa.ttu, short collection of eight ( originally ten) poems, each of ten verses, in praise of king of Cera country ( Malabar); Paripādal, twenty-four ( originally seventy) poems in praise of gods; Kalittogai, 150 love poems; Aganānāru, 400 lovelyrics of varying length; and Purandanuru, 400 poems in praise of kings.

33 first ten extracts r work of Mr J. R. Marr, to whom we r much indebted for permission to use them. other translations r our own, some made with help of many literal translations of Prof. P. T.

S. Iyengar. 51
34 Perhaps greatest literary figure in later Tamil was Viramamunivar ( 1680–1747), pseudonym of Father Costanzio Beschi, an Italian Jesuit who taught for thirty-six years in Tamil country. Like many earlyChristian missionaries, he lived in wholly Indian fashion and attained acomplete mastery of Tamil language and literary conventions. It isdoubtful if any European before or since has gained so profound aknowledge of an Indian language. Beschi’s long poem Témbāvani tellsstories from Old and New Testaments in ornately beautiful Tamil. Hisstyle and treatment of his themes were altogether in keeping withtradition, but influence of Tasso has been traced in his work.

35 material for this section, together with translations of Chinese verses, has been provided by Dr Arthur Waley. We r much indebted to him for honour of being permitted to publish dm here for first time.

EPILOGUE: HERITAGE OF INDIA


## IMPACT OF WEST
[Page 479]
INDIA’S ancient culture did not perish before onslaughts of Muslims, as did that of Persia. Under rule of some of Delhi sultans of Middle Ages there was persecution, and we read of temples being razed to ground and brāhmans put to death for practising their devotions in public; but in general Muslims were reasonably tolerant, and at alltimes Hindu chiefs continued to rule in outlying parts of India, payingtribute to their Muslim overlords. Conversions to Islam were numerous,though only in few regions were majority of Indians persuaded toembrace new faith. Hindu and Muslim lived side by side and, after afew centuries, Hindus in those parts of India dominated by Muslimsoften accepted situation as normal. In such conditions mutual influencewas inevitable. Hindus began to learn Persian, official language of theirMuslim rulers, and Persian words found their way into vernaculars.

Well-to-do Hindu families often adopted system of “strict parda” from Muslims, and made their womenfolk veil their faces in public. surviving Hindu kings borrowed new military techniques from theMuslims, learnt to employ cavalry with greater effect, and to use heavierarmour and new types of weapon. One great religious teacher of medievalIndia, Kabīr (1440–1518), poor weaver of Banāras, taught thebrotherhood of Hindu and Muslim alike in fatherhood of God, andopposed idolatry and caste practices, declaring that God was equally to befound in temple and mosque. Later, Nanāk (1469–1533), teacher of thePanjāb, taught same doctrine with even greater force, and founded anew faith, that of Sikhs, designed to incorporate all that was best of bothHinduism and Islām.

Nevertheless Muslim invasions, and enforced contact with, newideas, did not hv fertilizing effect upon Hindu culture which mighthave been expected. Hinduism was already very conservative when thelieutenants of Muhammad of Ghor conquered Ganges Valley. In theMiddle Ages, for every tolerant and progressive teacher there must havebeen hundreds of orthodox brahmans, who looked upon themselves as thepreservers of immemorial Āryan Dharma against barbarians whooverran holy [Page 480] land of Bhāratavarsa. Under their influence thecomplex rules of Hindu way of life became if anything stricter and morerigidly applied.

In 16th and 17th centuries Mughal emperors unified practicallythe whole of North India and much of Deccan, and built up an empiresuch as had not been seen since days of Guptas. Mughal periodwas one of great splendour, which has left its mark on India in form ofmany lovely buildings, wherein Islamic and Hindu motifs often blended ina perfect unity. Taj Mahal at Agra, Mughal capital, is of course themost famous memorial of times. Akbar ( 1555–1606), contemporaryof Queen Elizabeth I and first of four great Mughal emperors, fullyrealized that Empire could only stand on basis of complete toleration.

All religious tests and disabilities were abolished, including hated poll-tax on unbelievers. Rajput princes and other Hindus were given high officesof state, without conversion to Islam, and inter-communal marriages wereencouraged by example of Emperor himself. If policy of thegreatest of India’s Muslim rulers had been continued by his successors, herhistory might hv been very different.

The great-grandson of Akbar, Aurangzeb (1659–1707), reversed policy of toleration. Restrictions were placed on free practice of Hindu rites and preferment at court was confined to orthodox Muslims; later thetax on non-Muslims was reimposed. After nearly century of equality thiswas bitterly resented by many Hindus, especially by chiefs, many ofwhom had loyally served earlier Mughals. main resistance camefrom Western Deccan where, around Poona, Maratha chief Śivājī(1627–1680) laid foundations of new Hindu empire. At about thesame time Sikhs of Panjāb, incensed at new policy and thepersecution of their leaders, reformed their faith, and were welded into acloselyknit martial brotherhood. When aged Aurangzeb died theMughal empire was virtually at an end.

Politically 18th century was one of Hindu revival. Though Maratha successors of Śivājī could not build up large, closely-knit empire their horsemen ranged far and wide over India, levying tribute from local chiefs, Hindu and Muslim alike. In Panjāb towards end of century Sikhs built an important kingdom, and almost everywhere Islamwas on defensive. But there was still no real cultural revival inHinduism. Śivājī, brilliant leader, just ruler, and statesman ofconsummate craft, was conservative in his outlook, and appeared to hiscontemporaries rather as restorer of old than as builder of new.

Unlike Akbar, he had no fresh vision of state transcending religious differences, though he learnt [Page 481] much from Mughals in statecraft and military science and respected faith of his adversaries.

The Marathas did not encourage reforms in Hindu society, and India of 18th century was if anything more conservative than it had been in days of first Muslim invasions. It was through influence of Europe that revival came. Early in the16th century Portuguese founded first European trading stations andsettlements. They were followed by Dutch, British, Danes and French, andthroughout 17th century number of European “factories “increased.In 18th century, with breakup of Mughal empire, Europeansbegan to take greater interest in local politics, and by early 19th centurythe British East India Company had virtually pushed out its rivals anddominated most of sub-continent. comparative ease with which theBritish established their supremacy is measure of political decadenceof India at time. By middle of 19th century whole of Indiawas either directly ruled by Britain, or governed indirectly through pettyprinces with local autonomy. new conqueror had come, conqueror farmore alien to Hindu than Muslims had been, with an aggressiveculture and immense technical superiority.

Hindu society reacted at first to British rulers as it had done to Muslims, tending to withdraw itself even more into closed circle of its ancient traditions, and there was no realization of fundamental break with past. From orthodox point of view British rulers of Indiaconstituted caste, low in social scale, which had succeeded in gainingpolitical power. This caste had its own rules and customs which were notthose of Āryan, and should therefore not be imitated. British readilyaccepted this position, and, after 18th century, made few attempts atsocial contact. Any real friendship between Englishman and Indian becamemore and more difficult as century progressed-in fact Englishman inIndia unconsciously tended to adopt ideas of social stratification of theIndians whom he ruled, and to look upon his own people as members of aclass so exalted above Indians that any close association with dm wastaboo. This attitude was strengthened by Mutiny of 1857.

Nevertheless presence of Europeans could not but hv its effect. Except in certain parts of South India missionary activity in 18thcentury was insignificant; but early in 19th century Britishevangelical conscience awakened to India, and missions and missionschools sprang up in all larger towns. Meanwhile Company felt agrowing need for subordinate officers and clerks trained in English. Just as,in Muslim times, Hindu desirous of [Page 482] governmentemployment was compelled to learn Persian, so now he had to learnEnglish. Middle class Hindu fathers began to send their sons to Europeanschools, despite dangers of ritual impurity, and Western ideas began toaffect well-to-do educated Indian.

The Portuguese had succeeded in “westernizing” many of their Indian and Sinhalese subjects, and to this day Indian blood flows in veins of some old Portuguese families; few Indians in service of France cameto understand and admire culture of their conquerors; but perhaps thefirst Indian to learn enough from West to be able to hold his own withthe best minds of Europe, and yet still to love and respect his own culture,was Bengali Ram Mohan Roy, friend of Jeremy Bentham. RamMohan Roy, who was born in 1772 and died in England in 18S5, advocatedthe frank acceptance of all that Europe had to teach, and sect whichlooked to him for inspiration, Brahma Samaj, was in many ways closerto Christianity than to Hinduism. Never large in numbers, its influence waswidespread.

From days of Ram Mohan Roy young Indians, at first very few, but soon in greater numbers, began to come to England for education. littleband of Hindus educated on western lines, first in Bengal and then in otherparts of India, tended to go further in rejection of their own culture thantheir descendants; they were fully conscious of degeneracy which besettheir land, and many seem to hv been rather ashamed of their Hindubackground. Mutiny, which was fundamentally reactionary, found nosupport among tiny westernized intelligentsia. Universities ofCalcutta, Bombay and Madras, founded in 1857, year of Mutiny, atfirst paid scant attention to ancient culture of India, but taught apredominantly Western curriculum through Western staff.

By end of 19th century, however, situation had changed. Anew generation began to realize that Hindu culture had much of permanentvalue, and that slavish imitation of West could not solve India’sproblems. New organizations gave expression to this outlook. AryaSamaj claimed to reform Hinduism by purging it of all later degeneratefeatures and by return to Vedas, very liberally interpreted, and hadconsiderable success. Indian National Congress, founded in 1885,became mouthpiece of Indian public opinion. Newspapers in Englishand vernaculars multiplied.

Not only was Hindu culture largely rehabilitated in eyes of intelligent Hindus, but it even began to make counter-propaganda. few learned Europeans and Americans had long recognized nobility of much ancient Indian religious thought. Now, through [Page 483] TheosophicalSociety (which, despite its claim to represent quintessence of allreligions, propagates modernized Hinduism) and RamakrishnaMission, voice of Hinduism was heard in West. Swāmī Vivekānanda(1862–1902), splendid speaker of great spiritual power and personalmagnetism, preached Hinduism to large audiences in Europe and Americaand found willing hearers. Here and there Indians abjured West root andbranch, and fanatically defended even those aspects of Hinduism which hadcompletely outlived their usefulness; but, despite these reactionaries, thenew Hinduism was very different from old.

Rām Mohan Roy had sounded theme with his passionate advocacy ofsocial reform; Vivekananda repeated it with more nationalist timbre, whenhe declared that highest form of service of Great Mother was socialservice. Other great Indians, chief of whom was Mahatma Gandhi,developed theme of social service as religious duty, and thedevelopment continues under Gandhi’s successors.

Mahātmā Gāndhī was looked on by many, both Indian and European, as epitome of Hindu tradition, but this is false judgement for he was much influenced by Western ideas. Gandhi believed in fundamentals of his ancient culture, but his passionate love of underdog and hisantipathy to caste, though not unprecedented in ancient India, wereunorthodox in extreme, and owed more to European 19th-centuryliberalism than to anything Indian. His faith in non-violence was, as wehave seen, by no means typical of Hinduism-his predecessor in revolt, theable Maratha brāhman B. G. Tilak, and Gāndhī’s impatient lieutenantSubhas Chandra Bose, were far more orthodox in this respect. For Gandhi’spacifism we must look to Sermon on Mount and to Tolstoy. Hischampioning of women’s rights is also result of Western influence. Inhis social context he was always rather an innovator than conservative.

Though some of his colleagues thought his programme of limited social reform too slow, he succeeded in shifting whole emphasis of Hindu thought towards popular and equalitarian social order, in place of thehierarchy of class and caste. Following up work of many less well-known 19th-century reformers Gandhi and his followers of IndianNational Congress hv given new orientation and new life to Hinduculture, after centuries of stagnation.

Today there r few Indians, whatever their creed, who do not look back with pride on their ancient culture, and there r few intelligent Indians whoare not willing to sacrifice some of its effete elements that India maydevelop and progress. Politically and [Page 484] economically India facesmany problems of great difficulty, and no one cn forecast her future withany certainty. But it is safe to predict that, whatever that future may be, Indians of coming generations will not be unconvincing and self-consciouscopies of Europeans, but will be men rooted in their own traditions, andaware of continuity of their culture. Already, after only seven years ofindependence, extremes of national self-denigration and fanaticalcultural chauvinism r disappearing. We believe that Hindu civilization isin act of performing its most spectacular feat of synthesis. In past ithas received, adapted and digested elements of many different cultures-Indo-European, Mesopotamian, Iranian, Greek, Roman, Scythian, Turkish,Persian and Arab. With each new influence it has somewhat changed. Nowit is well on way to assimilating culture of West.

Hindu civilization will, we believe, retain its continuity. Bhagavad Gītā will not cease to inspire men of action, and Upanisads men ofthought. charm and graciousness of Indian way of life willcontinue, however much affected it may be by laboursaving devices ofthe West. People will still love tales of heroes of Mahābhārataand Rāmāyana, and of loves of Dusyanta and Sakuntala and


Purūravas and Urvaśī. quiet and gentle happiness which has at all times pervaded Indian life where oppression, disease and poverty hv not overclouded it will surely not vanish before more hectic ways of West.

Much that was useless in ancient Indian culture has already perished. extravagant and barbarous hecatombs of Vedic age hv long since been forgotten, though animal sacrifice continues in some sects. Widows havelong ceased to be burnt on their husbands’ pyres. Girls may not by law bemarried in childhood. In buses and trains all over India brāhmans rubshoulders with lower castes without consciousness of grave pollution,and temples r open to all by law. Caste is vanishing; process beganlong ago, but its pace is now so rapid that more objectionable features ofcaste may hv disappeared within generation or so. old familysystem is adapting itself to present-day conditions. In fact whole face ofIndia is altering, but cultural tradition continues, and it will never belost.

## WORLD’S DEBT TO INDIA

We hv said much about India’s debt to other cultures, but we must make it clear that she has given as much as or more than she has taken. Let us summarize world’s debt to India.

[Page 485] whole of South-East Asia received most of its culture from India. Early in 5th century B.c. colonists from Western India settled in Ceylon, which was finally converted to Buddhism in reign ofAśoka. By this time few Indian merchants had probably found their wayto Malaya, Sumatra, and other parts of South-East Asia. Gradually theyestablished permanent settlements, often, no doubt, marrying nativewomen. They were followed by brāhmans and Buddhist monks, and Indianinfluence gradually leavened indigenous culture, until, by 4thcentury A.D., Sanskrit was official language of region, and therearose great civilizations, capable of organizing large maritime empires, andof building such wonderful memorials to their greatness as Buddhiststūpa of Borobodūr in Java, or Saivite temples of Angkor in Cambodia.

Other cultural influences, from China and Islamic world, were felt in South-East Asia, but primary impetus to civilization came from India.
Indian historians, proud of their country’s past, often refer to this regionas “Greater India”, and speak of Indian “colonies”. In its usual modernsense term “colony” is hardly accurate, however.Vijaya, legendaryĀryan conqueror of Ceylon, is said to hv gained island by sword,but beyond this we hv no real evidence of any permanent Indian conquestoutside bounds of India. Indian “colonies” were peaceful ones, andthe Indianized kings of region were indigenous chieftains who hadlearnt what India had to teach them.

Northwards Indian cultural influence spread through Central Asia to China. Faint and weak contact between China and India was probably made in Mauryan times, if not before, but only when, some 2,000 years ago, Han Empire began to drive its frontiers towards Caspian did India andChina really meet. Unlike South-East Asia, China did not assimilate Indianideas in every aspect of her culture, but whole of Far East is inIndia’s debt for Buddhism, which helped to mould distinctivecivilizations of China, Korea, Japan and Tibet.

As well as her special gifts to Asia, India has conferred many practical blessings on world at large; notably rice, cotton, sugar cane, manyspices, domestic fowl, game of chess (p. 208), and, most importantof all, decimal system of numeral notation, invention of an unknownIndian mathematician early in Christian era (p. 495f). extent of thespiritual influence of India on ancient West is much disputed. Theheterodox Jewish sect of Essenes, which probably influenced earlyChristianity, followed monastic practices in some respects similar to thoseof Buddhism. Parallels may be traced between passages in NewTestament [Page 486] and Pali scriptures. 1 Similarities between theteachings of western philosophers and mystics from Pythagoras to Plotinusand those of Upanisads hv frequently been noticed. None of thesesimilarities, however, is close enough to give certainty, especially as wehave no evidence that any classical writer had deep knowledge of Indianreligion. We cn only say that there was always some contact between theHellenic world and India, mediated first by Achaemenid Empire, thenby that of Seleucids, and finally, under Romans, by traders of theIndian ocean. Christianity began to spread at time when this contact wasclosest. We know that Indian ascetics occasionally visited West, and thatthere was colony of Indian merchants at Alexandria. possibility ofIndian influence on Neo-platonism and early Christianity cannot be ruledout.

Many authorities may doubt that Indian thought had any effect on that of ancient West, but there cn be no doubt of its direct and indirect influence on thought of Europe and America in last century and half, though this has not received adequate recognition. This influence hasnot come by way of organized neo-Hindu missions. last eighty yearshave seen foundation of Theosophical Society, of various Buddhistsocieties, and of societies in Europe and America looking for inspiration tothe saintly 19th-century Bengālī mystic, Paramahamsa Ramakrishna, andhis equally saintly disciple, Swāmī Vivekānanda. Lesser organizations andgroups hv been founded in West by other Indian mystics and theirdisciples, some of dm noble, earnest and spiritual, others of more dubiouscharacter. Here and there Westerners themselves, sometimes armed with aworking knowledge of Sanskrit and first-hand Indian experience, hv triedto convert West to streamlined Yoga or Vedanta. We would in no waydisparage these teachers or their followers, many of whom r of greatintellectual and spiritual calibre; but whatever we may think of Westernpropagators of Indian mysticism, we cannot claim that they hv had anygreat effect on our civilization. More subtle, but more powerful, has beenthe influence of Mahatma Gandhi, through many friends of India in theWest who were impressed by his burning sincerity and energy, and by theultimate success of his policy of non-violence in achieving India’sindependence. Greater than any of these influences, however, has been theinfluence of ancient Indian religious literature through philosophy.

The pioneers of Asiatic Society of Bengal quickly gained small butenthusiastic following in Europe, and Goethe and many other writers of theearly 19th century read all they could of ancient Indian literature intranslation. We know that Goethe borrowed device [Page 487] of Indiandramaturgy for prologue to “Faust” (p. 433n), and who cn say that thetriumphant final chorus of second part of that work was not in partinspired by monism of Indian thought as he understood it? From Goetheonwards most of great German philosophers knew something of Indianphilosophy. Schopenhauer, whose influence on literature and psychologyhas been so considerable, indeed openly admitted his debt, and his outlookwas virtually that of Buddhism. monisms of Fichte and Hegel mightnever hv taken forms they did if it had not been for Anquetil-Duperron’s translation of Upanisads and work of other pioneerIndologists. In English-speaking world strongest Indian influencewas felt in America, where Emerson, Thoreau and other New Englandwriters avidly studied much Indian religious literature in translation, andexerted immense influence on their contemporaries and successors, notablyWalt Whitman. Through Carlyle and others German philosophers intheir turn made their mark on England, as did Americans through manylate 19th-century writers such as Richard Jeffries and Edward Carpenter.

Though in contemporary philosophical schools of Europe and America monistic and idealist philosophies of last century carry little weight, their influence has been considerable, and all of dm owe something at least to ancient India. sages who meditated in jungles of Ganges Valley six hundred years or more before Christ r still forces in world.

It is today something of an anachronism to speak of European civilization or Indian civilization. Until very recently cultures were sharply divided, butnow, when India is but thirty hours’ journey from London, culturaldivisions r beginning to disappear. If modus vivendi is reached betweenliberal democracy and communism, and civilization survives, world ofthe future will hv single culture with, it is to be hoped, many local differences and variations. India’s contribution to world’s cultural stockhas already been very large, and it will continue and grow as, in her newfreedom, her prestige and influence increases. For this reason if for no otherwe must take account of her ancient heritage in its successes and itsfailures, for it is no longer heritage of India alone, but of all mankind.



# APPENDIX I
COSMOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY
[Page 488]
THE universe of Vedas was simple affair-a flat circular earth below, a
heaven above, through which sun, moon and stars moved, and between
them middle air (antarzksa), abode of birds, clouds and demigods.

This picture of world was much complicated by later religious thought.

Indian ideas on origin and evolution of universe r rather a
matter of religion than of science and r considered elsewhere (p. 320ff).

All Indian religions, however, show certain concepts of cosmology incommon, which were fundamental presuppositions of Indian thought, andwere strikingly at variance with Semitic ideas which long influenced thethinking of West-the universe is very old; its evolution and decline arecyclic, repeated ad infinitum; it is immensely large; and there r otheruniverses beyond our own.

The Hindus believed that universe was shaped like an egg-theBrahmānda, or Egg of Brahma-divided into twenty-one zones or regions, ofwhich earth was seventh from top. Above earth were six heavens(not, as with Greeks, associated with planets), of increasingbeatitude. Below earth were seven stages of Pātāla, nether world,which were abode of nagas and other mythical beings and were notthought of as in any way unpleasant. Below Patala lay Naraka, or purgatory,also divided into seven zones, which were of increasing misery, andinhabited by souls in torment. universe hung in empty space, and wasvirtually isolated from other universes.The cosmic schemes of Buddhists and Jainas differed from this inmany details, but in fundamentals were same. All originally postulated aflat earth, but this was recognized by Indian astronomers to be incorrectearly in Christian era, and, though idea of flat earth remained forreligious purposes, learned realized, perhaps through influence ofGreek astronomy, that it was in fact spherical. Various estimates of its sizewere made, most popular being that of Brahmagupta (7th century A.D.),who gave its circumference as 5,000 yojanas. Assuming Brahmagupta’syojana to be short league of about 4½ miles, this figure is not far out,and is as accurate as any given by ancient astronomers.

The modest spherical earth of astronomers did not satisfy the
theologians, however, and even later religious literature described earthas flat disc of enormous size. In its centre was Mount Meru, round whichsun, moon and stars revolved. Around Meru were four continents (dvlpa),separated from central peak by oceans, and named acc to thegreat trees which stood on their shores opposite Meru. southerncontinent, on which human beings dwell, had ajambu (rose-apple) as itsdistinctive tree, and it was therefore called Jambudvīpa. southern zoneof this continent, [Page 489] separated from rest by Himalayas, was“the Land of Sons of Bharata” (Bhratavarsa), or India. Bharatavarsaalone was 9,000 yojanas across, and whole of Jambudvipa 33,000, or,according to some sources, 100,000 yojanas.

PLATE LXXXIX
This fantastic geographical scheme was not only one. In Puranas
Jambudvipa is described as ring around Meru, separated from nextcontinent, Plaksadvīpa, by an ocean of salt. Plaksadvīpa in turn forms aconcentric circle round Jambudvīpa, and so on to make total of sevencontinents, each circular and divided from its neighbour by an ocean ofdifferent composition-starting with Jambudvipa’s salt ocean and movingoutwards, of treacle, wine, ghee, milk, curds and fresh water respectively.
This brilliantly imaginative picture of world, which aroused scorn ofLord Macaulay, seems to hv been implicitly believed in by later Hindutheologians, and even astronomers could not emancipate themselvesfrom it, but adapted it to their spherical earth by making Meru earth’saxis, and continents zones on earth’s surface.

The oceans of butter and seas of treacle formed an effective barrier to growth of true science of geography. seven continents cannot in any way hv been related to actual portions of earth’s surface, though some modem students hv tried to identify dm with parts of Asia, and, as far asis known, no attempt was made to collate experience of travellers aspractical geography. astronomers gave fairly accurate longitudes ofimportant places in India. In early centuries of Christian eraAlexandria was known, and there r vague references to city of theRomakas in astronomical works; but geographical knowledge of thelearned was of vaguest description. Even within India distances anddirections, as given in texts, r usually very inaccurate and vague. Theconquerors who led armies thousands of miles on their campaigns, themerchants who carried their wares from one end of India to other, andthe pilgrims who visited sacred places from Himalayas to CapeComorin must hv had sound practical knowledge of Indian geography,while that of seamen who sailed ocean from Socotra to Canton musthave been even wider; but there r few echoes of this knowledge in theliterature of time.



# APPENDIX II
## ASTRONOMY
One of subsidiary studies (vedānga) of Vedic lore was jyotisa, aprimitive astronomy designed mainly for purpose of settling datesand times at which periodical sacrifices were to be performed. existingliterature on this topic is comparatively late, and gives no true indication ofIndia’s astronomical knowledge in Vedic period, though it is quite clear[Page 490] from passages in Vedic texts themselves that it was adequatefor practical purposes of time. It is probable that even at this earlyperiod there was some Mesopotamian influence on Indian astronomicalideas, but this cannot be established with certainty. Virtually certain,however, is influence of classical European astronomy, whichwasfeltin early centuries of Christian era, if not before.Several Greek words hv become common in Sanskrit and in laterIndian vernaculars through astronomy (p. 230), and other technical terms,not so widely known, r indisputably of Greek origin. Of fiveastronomical systems (siddhanta) known to 6th-century astronomerVarahamihira one is called Romaka Siddhdnta and another PaulidaSiddhanta, title which cn only be reasonably explained as recollectionof name of classical astronomer Paul of Alexandria.
The new astronomy was adopted chiefly for purposes of prognostication;for establishment of dates old luni-solar calendar, based on simplerobservations, was quite adequate. In earlier times Indians, though no lessinterested than other ancient peoples in foretelling future, preferred todo so by interpretation of dreams and omens (utpāta), and byphysiognomy, birthmarks, shape and size of features, and other signswhich were believed to give tokens of an individual’s fate. oldersystems of prognostication were not forgotten, but from Gupta timesonwards they gave pride of place to astrology, which from that day to thishas been implicitly believed in by nearly all Indians.Until this great development of astronomical knowledge heavens hadbeen charted by means of lunar mansions or naksatras, which wereapparently known even in time of Rg Veda. moon’s relation tothe fixed stars changes through cycle of approximately 27 solar days and71 hours, and thus heavens were divided into 27 portions, namedaccording to group of stars on ecliptic (the apparent orbit of sun)near which moon passes on each day of its cycle. As sidereal monthis in fact nearly eight hours more than 27 days twenty-eighth intercalarynaksatra was added by later astronomers to correct error. 1Western astronomy brought to India signs of zodiac, sevendayweek, hour, and several other ideas. Thanks to their achievements [Page491] in mathematics Indian astronomers made some advances on theknowledge of Greeks, and passed their lore, with that of mathematics,back to Europe by way of Arabs. As early as 7th century Syrianastronomer Severus Sebokht knew of greatness of Indian astronomy andmathematics (p. vi), and caliphs of Baghdad employed Indianastronomers. One word of terminology of medieval Europeanastronomy, aux, highest point of planet’s orbit, is certainly borrowedfrom Sanskrit ucca through Arabic.

Like all ancient astronomy, that of India was restricted owing toignorance of telescope; but methods of observation were perfectedwhich allowed very accurate measurement, and calculations were aided bythe decimal system of numerals. We know of no remains of observatories ofthe Hindu period, but those of 17th and 18th centuries, at Jaipur, Delhiand elsewhere, with their wonderfully accurate instruments, constructed onan enormous scale to minimize error, may well hv had their ancientcounterparts.

With naked eye as their sole means of observation Indians knew
only seven planets (graha) of ancients-Sun (SiSrya, Ravi), Moon(Candra, Soma), Mercury (Budha), Venus (Sukra), Mars (Mangala), Jupiter(Brhaspati) and Saturn (Śani);2 to these grahas two more were added, Rdhuand Ketu, ascending and descending nodes of moon. 3 At thebeginning of each æon all planets were believed to commence theirrevolutions in line, and to return to same position at end of it. Theapparently irregular course of planets was explained on hypothesisof epicycles, as in classical and medieval astronomy. Unlike Greeks, theIndians believed that planets had equal real motion, and that theirapparently different angular motion was due to their different distancesfrom earth.
For purposes of calculation planetary system was taken as geocentric,though Aryabhata in 5th century suggested that earth revolved roundthe sun and rotated on its axis; this theory was also known to laterastronomers, but it never affected astronomical practice. precession ofthe equinoxes was known, and calculated with some accuracy by medievalastronomers, as were lengths of year, lunar month, and otherastronomical constants. These calculations were reliable for most practicalpurposes, and in many cases more accurate than those of Greco-Romanworld. Eclipses were forecast with accuracy and their true causeunderstood.



# APPENDIX III
## CALENDAR
[Page 492] In recording dates basic unit was not solar day, but the
tithi, or lunar day, approximately thirty of which formed lunar month (i.e.

the four phases of moon) of about 291 solar days. month was
divided into two halves ( paksa) of fifteen tithis each, beginning with full
( pirnimdvdsyd) and new (amāvāsyā or bahuliāvsyā) moons respectively.

The fortnight beginning with new moon was called bright half(iuklapaksa) and other dark half (krsnapaksa). acc to thesystem followed in Northern India and much of Deccan monthbegan and ended with full moon, while in Tamil country monthgenerally began with new moon. Hindu calendar is still in usethroughout India for religious purposes.
The tithi might begin at any time of solar day. For practicalpurpose of recording dates that tithi current at sunrise was supposed toprevail for whole day and gave that day its number in paksa. If atithi began just after sunrise and ended before sunrise of next day, itwas expunged, and there was break in numerical sequence of days.

The year normally contained twelve lunar months: Caitra (March-April),Vaiśkha (April-May), Jyaistha (May-June),. Āsādha (June-July), Śrva (July-August), Bhādrapada or Prausthapada (August-September), Āsvina orĀsvayuja (September-October), Kārttika (October-November), Mārgasā orĀgrahāyana (November-December), Pausa or Taisa (December-January),Māgha (January-February) and Phālguna (February-March).4 acc tothe usual systems of reckoning year began with Caitra, but it wassometimes taken as beginning with Karttika or another month.

A group of two months formed season (rtu). six seasons of the
Indian year were: Vasanta (Spring, March-May), Grīsma (Summer, May–
July),
Varsā
(The
Rains,
July-September),
Sarad
(Autumn,
SeptemberNovember), Hemanta (Winter, November-January) and Sisira
(the Cool Season, January-March).

Twelve lunar months make only about 354 days, and problem of discrepancy between lunar and solar years was solved very early; sixty- two lunar months r approximately equal to sixty solar months, and so every thirty months an extra month was added to year, as in Babylonia.

This leap-month was generally inserted after Āsādha or Śrāvana and called second (dvitiya) Āsādha or Śravana. Thus every second or third year contains thirteen months, and is some twenty-nine days longer than others.

[Page 493] Hindu calendar, though quite efficient, is thus rather cumbrous, and is so different from solar calendar that it is impossible to reduce dates from one to other without very complicated calculations or lengthy tables. It is even impossible to establish at glance month in which given Hindu date falls with any certainty.

Indian dates r usually given in order-month, paksa, tithi, abbreviations sudi and badi being used for bright and dark halves of month; e.g. Caitra sudi 7 means seventh day from new moon of month Caitra.

The solar calendar, imported with Western astronomy, was also known from Gupta times onwards though it did not oust old luni-solar calendar until recent years. Where solar dates r given in early records they r usually mentioned for extra accuracy, with prevailing naksatra of day in question, after regular luni-solar date. In solar calendar themonths r named after signs of zodiac, which r literal or nearlyexact translations of their Greek originals: Mesa (Aries), Vrsabha (Taurus),Mithuna (Gemini), Karkata (Cancer), Sizmha (Leo), Kanyd (Virgo), Tula(Libra), Vrścika (Scorpio), Dhanus (Sagittarius), Makara (Capricornus),Kumbha (Aquarius) and Mzna (Pisces). With solar calendar seven-day week was also introduced, days being named after their presidingplanets as in Greco-Roman system: Ravivara (Sunday), Somavāra(Monday), Mangalavāra (Tuesday), Budhavāra (Wednesday), Brhaspativāra(Thursday), ukravāra (Friday) and Śanivāra (Saturday).

## ERAS
Until 1st century B.C. there is no good evidence that India had anyregular system of recording year of an event by dating in definite eralike A.U.C. of Rome or Christian era of medieval and modernEurope. Early inscriptions r dated if at all in regnal year of rulingking. idea of dating over long period of time from fixed year wasalmost certainly introduced into India by invaders of North-West,who hv left earliest inscriptions thus dated in India. Unfortunately theIndians did not adopt uniform era, and number of systems of datingwere in use from that time onwards, chief of which, in order ofimportance, r as follows:

The Vikrama Era (58 B.C.), traditionally founded by king calledVikramaditya, who drove Sakas out of Ujjayini and founded era tocelebrate his victory. only king who both took title Vikramadityaand drove Sakas from Ujjayini was Candra Gupta II, who lived over400 years later than beginning of Vikrama era, and so legend iscertainly false. In earliest inscriptions using this era, all from WesternIndia, it is called simply Krta (” established”), or “handed down by theMalava tribe “. Some authorities believe that many inscriptions of Sakas[Page 494] and Pahlavas of North-West India r to be read in this era, andthat it was founded by Azes, one of their early kings; but this is by nomeans certain. This era was most popular in North India. Its year beganoriginally with month KIrttika, but by medieval times Vikrama yearsbegan in bright half of Caitra in North, and in dark half of thesame month in Peninsula.

The Saka Era (A.D. 78) was, acc to tradition, founded by Saka king who occupied Ujjayini 137 years after Vikramaditya. This era may in fact hv been founded by Kaniska, and was certainly used early in 2nd century A.D. by “Western Satraps”, who ruled Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence use of era spread through Deccan and was exported to South-East Asia.

The Gupta Era (A.D. 320) was probably founded by Candra Gupta I, and its use was continued by Maitraka dynasty of Gujarat for some centuries after Gupta empire fell.

TheHarsa Era (A.D. 606), founded by Harsavardhana of Kanyakubja, was popular in Northern India for century or two after his death.

The Kalacuri Era (A.D. 248), perhaps founded by small dynasty called
the Traikutaka, was current in Central India down to Muslim invasion.
Other eras of local or temporary importance were Laksmana Era ofBengal (A.D. 1119), wrongly said to hv been founded by King LaksmanaSena; Saptarsi or Laukika Era, current in Kashmār in Middle Ages,and recorded in cycles of one hundred years, each cycle commencingseventysix years after each Christian century; Licchavi and Nevar Erasof Nepal (A.D. 110 and 878); Kollam Era of Malabar (A.D. 825); and theEra of Vikramaditya VI Cdlukya (A.D. 1075). Era of Kaliyuga (3102B.C., v. p. 39 above) was often used for religious dates and rarely forpolitical. In Ceylon Buddha Era from 544 B.C. was in use from anuncertain date, when it probably replaced an earlier reckoning from 483 B.C.

The Jainas used an Era of Mahdvmra, reckoned from 628 B.C. two latter eras, together with Vikrama and Saka Eras, r still in use for religious purposes, but others r extinct.

In reducing dates in Indian eras to Christian era it must beremembered that year, acc to most reckonings, begins with themonth of Caitra, which usually commences in middle of March. Thusthe months Magha and Phalguna, and generally second half of Pausa,occur in Christian year after that in which Hindu year began. Dateswere usually given in expired years; this was sometimes explicitly stated(e.g. “when 493 years had passed from establishment of tribe of theMalavas”), but more often taken for granted. In medieval dates it is best toassume an expired year, even when this is not specified, unless there isspecial reason to believe otherwise.

The following table will be useful for reducing Indian dates to the
Christian era:

# APPENDIX IV
## MATHEMATICS
Through necessity of accurately laying out open-air site of a
sacrifice Indians very early evolved simple system of geometry, but in the
sphere of practical knowledge world owes most to India in realm ofmathematics, which were developed in Gupta times to stage moreadvanced than that reached by any other nation of antiquity. success ofIndian mathematics was mainly due to fact that Indians had clearconception of abstract number, as distinct from numerical quantity ofobjects or spatial extension. While Greek mathematical science was largelybased on mensuration and geometry, India transcended these conceptionsquite early, and, with aid of simple numeral notation, devised arudimentary algebra which allowed more complicated calculations thanwere possible to Greeks, and led to study of number for its ownsake.

In earlier inscriptions of India dates and other numerals r written in notation not unlike that of Romans, Greeks and Hebrews, with separate symbols for tens and hundreds. earliest inscription recording date by system of nine digits and zero, with place notation for tens and hundreds, comes from Gujarat, and is dated A.D. 595.5 Soonafter this however, new system had been heard of in Syria (p. vi), 6 andwas being used as far afield as Indo-China. Evidently system was in useamong mathematicians some centuries before it was employed ininscriptions, scribes of which tended to be conservative in their systemof [Page 496] recording dates; in modem Europe cumbrous Romansystem is still sometimes used for same purpose. name of themathematician who devised simplified system of writing numerals isunknown, but earliest surviving mathematical texts-the anonymous“Bakshali Manuscript”, which is copy of text of 4th century A.D., andthe terse Jryabhatzya of Aryabhata, written in A.D. 499-presuppose it.

For long it was thought that decimal system of numerals was inventedby Arabs, but this is certainly not case. Arabs themselves calledmathematics “the Indian (art)” (hindisat), and there is now no doubt that thedecimal notation, with other mathematical lore, was learnt by Muslimworld either through merchants trading with west coast of India, orthrough Arabs who conquered Sind in A.D. 712.

The debt of Western world to India in this respect cannot beoverestimated. Most of great discoveries and inventions of whichEurope is so proud would hv been impossible without developed systemof mathematics, and this in turn would hv been impossible if Europe hadbeen shackled by unwieldy system of Roman numerals. unknownman who devised new system was from world’s point of view, afterthe Buddha, most important son of India. His achievement, thougheasily taken for granted, was work of an analytical mind of firstorder, and he deserves much more honour than he has so far received.

Medieval Indian mathematicians, such as Brahmagupta (7th century), Mahavira (9th century) and Bhaskara (l2th century), made several discoveries which in Europe were not known until Renaissance or later.

They understood import of positive and negative quantities, evolvedsound systems of extracting square and cube roots, and could solvequadratic and certain types of indeterminate equations. For iT Aryabhatagave usual modern approximate value of 3 1416, expressed in formof fractionThis value of rr, much more accurate than that of theGreeks, was improved to nine places of decimals by later Indianmathematicians. Some steps were made in trigonometry, spherical geometryand calculus, chiefly in connexion with astronomy. mathematicalimplications of zero (sUnya) and infinity, never more than vaguely realizedby classical authorities, were fully understood in medieval India. Earliermathematicians had taught that, but Bhaskara proved that it wasinfinity. He also established mathematically what had been recognized inIndian theology at least millenium earlier, that infinity, however divided,remains infinite, represented by equation

## PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
Ancient Indian ideas of physics were closely linked with religion and theology, and differed somewhat from sect to sect. As early as time of Buddha, if not before, universe was classified by elements, of which[Page 497] all schools admitted at least four-earth, air, fire and water. Tothese orthodox Hindu schools and Jainism added fifth, dkda, which isgenerally translated “ether”. It was recognized that air was not of infiniteextension, and Indian mind, with its abhorrence of vacuum, found ithard to conceive of empty space. five elements were thought of as themediums of sense impressions-earth of smell, air of feeling, fire of vision,water of taste, and ether of sound. Buddhists and Ajivikas rejected ether, butthe latter added life, joy and sorrow, which were thought of as in some waymaterial, making total of seven elements.

Most schools believed that elements other than ether were atomic.

Indian atomism was certainly independent of Greek influence, for an atomictheory was taught by Pakudha Katyayana, an older contemporary of theBuddha, and was therefore earlier than that of Democritus. Jainasbelieved that all atoms (anu) were identical, and that differences of thecharacter of elements were due to manner in which atoms werecombined. Most schools, however, maintained that there were as manytypes of atom as there were elements.

The atom was generally thought to be eternal, but some Buddhists conceived of it not only as minutest object capable of occupying space, but also as occupying minutest possible duration of time, coming into being and vanishing almost in an instant, only to be succeeded by anotheratom, caused by first. Thus atom of Buddhism in some measureresembles quantum of Planck. atom was quite invisible to thehuman eye; orthodox Vaisesika school believed single atom to be amere point in space, completely without magnitude.

A single atom had no qualities, but only potentialities, which came into play when atom combined with others. Vaisesika school, which specially elaborated atomic doctrines, and was school of atomism par excellence, maintained that, before combining to form material objects, atoms made primary combinations of diads and triads. This doctrine of molecules was developed differently by Buddhists and Ajivikas, who taughtthat in normal conditions no atoms existed in pure state, but onlycombined in different proportions in molecule (samgh.dta, kalapa). Everymolecule contained at least one atom of all four types, and obtained itscharacter from predominance of given element. This hypothesisaccounted for fact that matter might show characteristics of more thanone element: thus wax might melt and also burn, because its moleculescontained proportions of water and fire. acc to Buddhists themolecules cohered by virtue of atoms of water in each, which acted asadhesive.

Indian atomic theories were not based so much on experiment, as on intuition and logic. They were not universally held. great theologian Safikara (p. 328) did not believe in atoms and argued strongly against their existence. But atomic theories of ancient India r brilliant imaginative explanations of physical structure of world; though it is probably mere coincidence that they agree in part with theories of modem physics, they r nevertheless much to credit of intellect and imagination of early Indian thinkers.

[Page 498] Beyond this ancient Indian physics developed little. Without knowledge of an all-embracing law of gravity it remained in rudimentary state, like all physical systems of ancient world. It was generally believed that elements of earth and water tended to fall, and fire to rise, and it was recognized that solids and fluids alike generally expanded onheating, but no serious effort was made to study such phenomenaexperimentally. In science of acoustics, however, India made realdiscoveries based on experiment, and ear, highly trained by phoneticstudy necessary for correct recitation of Vedas, learned todistinguish musical tones far closer than those of other early musicalsystems. Before Christian era octave was divided into twenty-twosrutis, or quarter-tones (p. 382), and their proportions were measured withgreat accuracy. It was recognized that differences of timbre were caused byovertones (anuranana), which varied with different instruments.

We know from evidence of Iron Pillar of Delhi (p. 219 f) and other sources that Indian metallurgists Śained great proficiency in extraction of metal from ore and in metal-casting, and their products were known and valued in Roman Empire and Middle East; but their knowledge appears to hv been largely pragmatic, and had no counterpartin highly developed science of metallurgy. Chemistry in ancient India wasthe handmaid, not of technology, but of medicine; her chemists did notshare interest of medieval Europe in transmuting base metal into gold,but apparently devoted most of their attention to making medicines, drugsto promote longevity, aphrodisiacs, poisons, and their antidotes. Thesemedical chemists did succeed in producing many important alkalis, acidsand metallic salts by simple processes of calcination and distillation, and ithas even been suggested, without good basis, that they discovered form ofgunpowder.

In Middle Ages Indian chemists, like their counterparts in China, Muslim World and Europe, became engrossed in study of mercury, perhaps through contact with Arabs. school of alchemists arose, who experimented with wonderful fluid metal, and decided that it was thespecific for all diseases, source of perpetual youth, and even surestmeans to salvation. In this infatuation with mercury Indian chemistryfoundered, but not before it had passed many ideas on to Arabs, whogave dm to medieval Europe.


# APPENDIX VI
## PHYSIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
The Vedas show very primitive stage of medical and physiological lore,but basic textbooks of Indian medicine-the compendia of Caraka (lst-2nd centuries A.D.) and Sufruta (c. 4th century A.D.)-are products [Page499] of fully evolved system which resembles those of Hippocrates andGalen in some respects, and in others has developed beyond them. We haveno medical texts of intervening period, but there is little doubt that twofactors encouraged medical knowledge-the growth of interest in physiologythrough phenomena of yoga and mystical experience, and Buddhism.

Like Christian missionary of later times Buddhist monk often served as doctor among layfolk from whom he begged his food; moreover he was encouraged to care for his own health and that of his fellow-monks,and his creed tended towards rationalism and distrust of medicalmagic of earlier times. development of medicine was also probablystimulated by contact with Hellenic physicians, and resemblancesbetween Indian and classical medicine suggest borrowing on both sides.

After Susruta Indian medicine developed little, except in growing use of mercurial drugs, and of others such as opium and sarsaparilla, which were introduced by Arabs. In its essentials system practised by ayurvedic physician of present day India remains same.

The basic conception of Indian medicine, like that of ancient and medieval Europe, was humours (dosa). Most authorities taught that health was maintained through even balance of three vital fluids of body-wind, gall and mucus, to which some added blood as fourth humour. three primary humours were connected with scheme of three gunas, or universal qualities (p. 324 f), and associated with virtue, passion and dullness respectively.

The bodily functions were maintained by five “winds” (vdyu): udana, emanating from throat, and causing speech; prana, in heart, and responsible for breathing and swallowing of food; samana, fanning fire in stomach which “cooked” or digested food, and dividing it into its digestible and indigestible parts; apana in abdomen, andresponsible for excretion and procreation; and vyana, generally diffusedwind, causing motion of blood and of body generally. fooddigested by samana became chyle, which proceeded to heart, andthence to liver, where its essence was converted into blood. blood inturn was in part converted into flesh and process was continued throughthe series fat, bone, marrow and semen; latter, when not expelled,produced energy (ojas), which returned to heart and was thence diffusedover body. This process of metabolism was believed to take place inthirty days.

Ancient Indian doctors had no clear knowledge of function of brain, and believed with most ancient peoples that heart was seat of intelligence. They realized, however, importance of spinal cord (p.

326 f), and knew of existence of nervous system, though it was not properly understood. progress of physiology and biology was impeded by taboo on contact with dead bodies, which much discouraged dissection and study of anatomy, although such practices were not completely unknown.

Despite their inaccurate knowledge of physiology, which was by no means inferior to that of most ancient peoples, India evolved developed empirical surgery. caesarian section was known, bone-setting reached high [Page 500] degree of skill, and plastic surgery was developed far beyond anything known elsewhere at time. Ancient Indian surgeonswere expert at repair of noses, ears and lips, lost or injured in battle orby judicial mutilation. In this respect Indian surgery remained ahead ofEuropean until 18th century, when surgeons of East IndianCompany were not ashamed to learn art of rhinoplasty from Indians.

Though Indians very early conceived of existence of microscopic
forms of life, it was never realized that these might cause diseases; but if
Indian surgeons had no true idea of antisepsis or asepsis they encouraged
scrupulous cleanliness as they understood it, and recognized therapeutic value of fresh air and light. pharmacopoeia of ancient India was verylarge, and comprised animal, vegetable and mineral products. Many Asiaticdrugs were known and used long before their introduction into Europe,notably oil of chaulmugra tree, traditionally prescribed as specificfor leprosy, and still basis of modern treatment of disease.

The physician was highly respected member of society, and vaidyas
rank high in caste hierarchy to this day. rules of professionalbehaviour laid down in medical texts remind us of those of Hippocrates andare not unworthy of conscientious doctor of any place or time. We quotepart of sermon which Caraka instructs physician to preach to hispupils at solemn religious ceremony to be performed on completion oftheir apprenticeship.

“If you want success in your practice, wealth and fame, and heaven after
your death, you must pray every day on rising and going to bed for thewelfare of all beings, especially of cows and brahmans, and you must strivewith all your soul for health of sick. You must not betray yourpatients, even at cost of your own life. …. You must not get drunk, orcommit evil, or hv evil companions. … You must be pleasant of speech… and thoughtful, always striving to improve your knowledge.

“When you go to home of patient you should direct your words,
mind, intellect and senses nowhere but to your patient and his treatment. ….

Nothing that happens in house of sick man must be told outside, nor
must patient’s condition be told to anyone who might do harm by that
knowledge to patient or to another.” 7
Under patronage of more benevolent kings and religious foundationsfree medical aid was given to poor. AMoka took pride in fact that hehad provided medicines for man and beast, and traveller Fa-hsien, in theearly 5th century A.D., made special note of free hospitals maintained bythe donations of pious citizens. Unfortunately we hv no detaileddescriptions of such establishments.

Veterinary medicine was also practised. doctrine of non-violenceencouraged endowment of animal refuges and homes for sick and agedanimals, and such charities r still maintained in many cities of India. Thehorse and elephant doctors were members of skilled and respectedprofessions, much in demand at court, and texts on veterinary sciencesurvive from Middle Ages.


# APPENDIX VII
## LOGIC AND EPISTEMOLOGY
[Page 501] With such an intense interest in metaphysical problems and atradition of lively debate and discussion it is not surprising that Indiadeveloped her own distinctive system of logic. basic logical text is theNyaya Sātras of Gautama, perhaps composed in early centuries of theChristian era, series of brief aphorisms much commented on by laterwriters, and foundation-text of Nyaya, one of six schools oforthodox philosophy (p. 323). Logic was not, however, confined to this oneschool, but was utilized and adapted by Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina alike.

One of most important topics of Indian thought in this field was the
question of pramdna, which may be translated “means of reliable knowledge’8. acc to later Nyaya schools there were four pramanas, perception (pratyaksa), inference (anumdna), inference byanalogy or comparison (upamdna), and “word” (6abda), pronouncementof reliable authority, such as Vedas. Vedanta school addedintuition or presumption (arthdpatti) and non-perception (anupalabdhi), thelatter an unnecessary scholastic refinement. six categories overlappedsomewhat, and Buddhists generally included all forms of knowledgeunder first two categories, while Jainas usually allowed only three,perception, inference and revelation. materialists allowed onlyperception, and their opponents made short work of their efforts at provingby inference that inference could not give reliable knowledge.

It was probably in study of process of inference that schools oftrue logic arose. From necessities of metaphysical discussion falsearguments were analysed and classified; of these logicians recognized thechief fallacies of classical logic, such as reductio ad absurdum(arthaprasanga), circular argument (cakra), infinite regression (anavasthd),dilemma (anyonyairaya), and ignoratio elenchi (atmdsraya).

A correct inference was established by syllogism, of which Indianform (paicdvayava) was somewhat more cumbrous than Aristotelian. Itsfive members were known as proposition (pratijia), reason (hetu), example(uddharana), application (upanaya) and conclusion (nigamana). Theclassical Indian example may be paraphrased as follows:
(1) There is fire on mountain,
(2) because there is smoke above it,
(3) and where there is smoke there is fire, as, for instance, in kitchen;
(4) such is case with mountain,
(5) and therefore there is fire on it.

The third term of Indian syllogism corresponds to major premiss
of that of Aristotle, second to Aristotle’s minor premiss, and first to his conclusion. Thus Indian syllogism reversed order of that ofclassical logic, argument being stated in first and second [Page 502]clauses, established by general rule and example in third, and finallyclinched by virtual repetition of first two clauses. “example” (inthe above syllogism kitchen) was generally looked on as an essentialpart of argument, and helped to strengthen its rhetorical force. Evidentlythis elaborate system of syllogism is outcome of much practicalexperience in discussion. Three-membered syllogisms were admitted by theBuddhists, who rightly rejected fourth and fifth members of theorthodox syllogism as tautological.
The basis of generalization (for example “where there is smoke thereis fire”) on which every inference rests was believed to be the’quality ofuniversal concomitance (vydpti). nature and origin of this quality wasmuch discussed, and its consideration led to theories of universals andparticulars, which r too recondite for consideration in this book.

No treatment of Indian thought is complete without brief reference to
the remarkable epistemological relativity of Jainism. Jaina thinkers, andsome other heterodox teachers also, explicitly rejected what in classicallogic is called law of excluded middle. For Jaina there were notmerely two possiblities of existence and non-existence, but seven. Thuswe may affirm (1) that an object, say knife, exists as knife. We mayfurther say (2) that it is not something else, say fork. But it exists as aknife and does not exist as fork, and so we may declare of it (s) that in oneaspect it is and in another it is not. From another point of view (4) it isindescribable; its ultimate essence is unknown to us and we cannot positanything final about it-it is inexpressible. By combining this fourthpossiblitywith three former ones we obtain three further possibilities ofpredication-(5) it is, but its nature is otherwise indescribable, (6) it is not,but its nature isindescribable,and(7)itbothisand is not, but its nature isindescribable. This system of seven aspects of predication is known assyadvada (“the doctrine of ‘maybe’”), or saptabhangi (“the sevenfolddivision”). 9As well as syadvada Jainas had another sevenfold system ofpredication known as nayavdda, theory of standpoints, or ways ofapproaching an object of observation or study. first three of these areconnected with object itself (dravydrthika), and latter four with itsmodifications and words used to describe it (parydydrthika). (1) Amango tree may be considered simultaneously as an individual having adefinite size and shape and as member of species “mango tree”; (2) itmay be treated merely as representative of “universal” mango tree,and as corresponding to general concept of mango tree, without takingits individual qualities into account; or (s) it may be considered merely asan individual, without taking note of its specific qualities. Further it may bethought of (4) as it is at present moment, for instance as bearing ripefruit, without any regard to its past as sapling or its future as firewood. (5)We may think of it from point of view of its name “mango”, consideringall [Page 503] synonyms of that name, and their implications. Thesesynonyms may be subtly differentiated, and (6) we may consider theirnuances and connotations. Finally (7) we may consider an object in itsrelation to given epithet; thus by referring to hero as “lion” wementally abstract all his unlionlike qualities, and think of him only as abeing of strength and courage.10 Some Jaina schools rejected last threestandpoints, which r hardly consistent with first four, being rathersemantic in character than epistemological.

Modern logicians might make short work of these rather pedanticsystems of ontological and epistemological relativity, but they hv afundamental quality of breadth and realism, implying full realization thatthe world is more complex and subtle than we think it, and that what is trueof thing in one of its aspects may at same time be false in another.

# APPENDIX VIII
## WEIGHTS AND MEASURES

MEASURES OF WEIGHT
The basic weight of ancient India was raktikd, bright red seed of gunja (abrus precatorius), which was conventionally reckoned at about 1.83 grains (.118 grams). Many sources give series of weights rising from this, which r not wholly consistent, and show that standards varied very widely with time and place.

The goldsmith’s scale given by Manu, which was probably most widely followed, was:
5 raktikds = 1 mdsa,
16 mdsas = 1 karsa, tolaka, or suvarna,
4 karsas = 1 pala,
10 palas = 1 dharana.

The weight of pala was thus approximately 1j oz., or 37–76 gms. Of heavier weights chief were prastha, usually given as of 16 palas, and drona of 16 prasthas. prastha was thus approximately 21 oz., and drona 21¼ lb.

MEASURES OF LENGTH
The commonest table, omitting microscopic measurements, was:
8 yava (barleycorns) = 1 angula (finger’s breadth, I in.)

12 ahgulas =
1 vztasti (span, 9 ins.)

2 vitastis =
1 hasta or aratni (cubit, 18 ins.)

4 hastas =
1 daynda (rod) or dhanus (bow, 6 ft.)

2,000 dhanus =
1 krosa (cry) or goruta (cow-call, 2j miles)
4 kroias =
1 yojana (stage, 9 miles approx.).

[Page 504] Though most sources give krosa (in modern Indian languages kos) as of 2,000 dandas Arthas’stra gives it as of only 1,000, yojana, which was commonest measure of long distances in ancient India, being thus of only 41 miles. It is therefore clear that there were at least two yojanas, and distances as given in texts r thus very unreliable. It would seem that for practical purposes shorter yojana was more often used than longer, especially in earlier times.



MEASURES OF TIME
Ancient Indian learned men devised detailed terminology for minute intervals of time, which had little relation to everyday life and must be looked on as flight of fancy. longer measurements in most general use were:
18 nimesas (winks) = 1 kdsthd ( secs.),
30 kdsthas =
1 kala ( mins.)

15 kalds =
1 nd.dikd or ndlikd (24 mins.)

30 kales or 2 nddikds = 1 muhirta or ksaza (48 mins.)

30 muhurtas =
1 aho-rdtra (day and night, 24 hours).

A measurement frequently used, but not consistent with this system, was ydma or watch, one-eighth of day and night, or three hours. In some sources, however, ydma is given as three muhurtas, or one-tenth of day and night. hour (hord) was introduced from West in Gupta period and was used in astronomy, but was not widely employed in everyday life.

For longer measures of time see p. 492 ff.

# APPENDIX IX
## COINAGE11

EARLY PUNCH MARKED COINS
Uninscribed punchmarked coins were minted from 6th century B.C.

onwards, and were in circulation for many centuries. Among earliest silver specimens r those in shape of small bent bar, largest of which, satamdna, weighed 180 grains. Half, quarter and half-quarter satamdnas r attested.

The basic silver punchmarked coin of usual type was kdr.sdpana or pana, of 6578 grains. mdsa or mdsika weighed one-sixteenth of this, or 3.6 grains. Various intermediate weights r attested, as well as large silver coins of so and 20 mdsas and small half-mdsa pieces.

Punchmarked copper coins were generally based on different standard —a māsa of 9 grains and kdrsdpana of 144. Quarter-mdsas in copper, or [Page 505] kdkinis (2.25 grains) r attested, as well as large coins of 20, so and 45 copper masas.

Only one gold punchmarked coin is known, and it must be assumed that gold was very rarely minted before beginning of Christian era.

## INDO-GREEK COINS
The earlier Greek kings minted coins acc to Attic standard, based on drachm of 67.2 grains and obol (6 drachm) of 11 2 grains.

Silver coinage of this type ranges from hemiobols to very large double decadrachms, struck by king Amyntas, which hv recently been found in Afghanistan. After their southward expansion Greeks adopted reduced weight, with silver coins of 152 and 38 grains.

The Greek kings issued numerous copper coins, but their metrology is not clear. Gold coins must hv been very rare. There exist very large 20 stater piece of Bactrian usurper Eucratides and rare staters of few other kings.  Śaka and Pahlava coins in silver and copper follow reduced IndoGreek standard.

## KUSANA COINS
These were minted in gold and copper. gold dinras or suvarnas were based on Roman denarius and were of 124 grains. Double and quarter dinras were also issued. copper coins were large, of from 26 to 28 mdsas, or 240 to 260 grains.

## PRE-GUPTAN AND GUPTAN COINS
A large range of coins in silver and copper, of very varied weight andcharacter, was issued by indigenous kings, tribes and cities of NorthernIndia in centuries immediately preceding and following beginning ofthe Christian era. Satavahanas of Deccan also issued coins of leadand potin (base silver), while Sakas of Gujarat, Malwa and WesternDeccan issued distinctive series of coins in silver.

The gold coins of Guptas (dfndra) originally approximated to theKusana standard, but in middle of 5th century rose in weight to 144grains, thus returning to Indian standard of copper kr.sapana. Guptasilver coins (ripaka), based on those of Sakas of Ujjayini, weighed 32–36 grains. metrology of Gupta copper coinage is obscure, and weightsof from 33s to 101 grains r attested.

## MEDIEVAL COINS
Gold coins (suvarna, tanka) were minted by only few dynasties in 11th century. These approximated to Greek drachm standard of 67 grains. Silver coins (dramma, tanka) also conformed to this standard, andcoins of i, i and i dramma r attested. Numerous types of copper coin wereissued, of diverse metrology. coinage of medieval dynasties of thePeninsula was very varied and full study of its metrology is yet to bemade.



APPENDIX X
THE ALPHABET AND ITS PRONUNCIATION
[Page 506]
The alphabet devised by ancient Indian phoneticians and adapted to all
the chief Indian languages except Urdfi is as follows:

I. VOWELS


II. CONSONANTS

[Page 507] To these letters Dravidian languages and Sinhalese add
the short vowels e (between I and e) and 6 (between e and o). Sinhalese has
also additional vowels and d (between and i). Tamil adds the
consonants 1, I (not same as vocalic I of Sanskrit), r, and n at end
of alphabet; these letters cannot stand at beginning of word. The
Tamil alphabet omits aspirate letters and several others, and the
unvoiced letters serve to express sound of voiced. system of
transliteration used for Tamil words and quotations in this book does not
show this peculiarity.

It will be seen that this alphabet is methodical and scientific, its elements
classified first into vowels and consonants, and then, within each section,
according to manner in which sound is formed. gutturals are
formed by constriction of throat at back of tongue, the
palatals by pressing tongue flat against palate, retroflex by
turning up tip of tongue to touch hard palate, dentals by
touching upper teeth with tongue, and labials by pursing lips.

The vowels a, i,,, i,, e, ai, o, and au r pronounced approximately as in
German or Italian, e and o being “close” sounds, as in German beten and
boten, but short has dull sound of English shut. In very early times
r and vocalic / were pronounced approximately as r second
syllables of words water and bottle by Americans, but before the
Christian era they were sounded as ri and Iri. Sinhalese d and are
pronounced approximately as vowels in English hat and hair
respectively. acc to traditional phonetics e and o r classed as
diphthongs and in Sanskrit r invariably long.

Of two first consonants h, occurring only at end of words or
syllables, is rough breathing, replacing an original s or r. It is distinct
emission of breath, often followed by faint continuation of preceding
vowel. Anusvara, or m, written in Indian scripts as dot, is in part mere
abbreviation, representing nasal sound before stopped consonant. Thus
samdhi is pronounced as sandhi, and atmga as aniga. Before semi-vowels,
sibilants or h it had effect of nasalizing precedingvowel, as in
Frenchor Portuguese; thus amSu was pronounced very approximately as the
French un chou. By many moder speakers m in this position is pronounced
as English ng in sang.

The distinction between aspirate and unaspirate consonants is not
immediately recognized by European, but it is clear to Indian. K, for
instance, is pronounced without any noticeable emission of breath, and kh
(written as one letter in Indian scripts) with strong emission, as in the
usual pronunciation of English c in come. Thus reader should avoid
the temptation to pronounce th and ph as initial sounds of English
thing and phial; they approximate to sounds in pothook and shepherd. C
is pronounced approximately as second consonantal sound in the
English church, and ch as first sound in same word, i.e., with a
stronger emission of breath. J is pronounced as in English, and not as in
German or French. clear distinction is made between retroflex or
cerebral [Page 508] consonants and dental, though it is not very evident
to untrained English ear. English t and d r nearer to Indian
retroflex t and d than to Indian dentals t and d, which approximate to the
corresponding sounds in Italian.

Modern Indians do not generally differentiate in speaking between f and
s, and inscriptions show that two sounds began to be confused at an
early date. Both resemble sh in English shut. Originally s was
pronounced, like other retroflex consonants, with tip of tongue
touching top of hard palate.

Of special Tamil letters I has sound of an I with tongue turned
as far back as possible. Many modem Tamil speakers pronounce this letter
rather like s in English measure or Frenchj, but more harshly.

The consonantal I (which also occurs in Vedic and some Prakrits) is
pronounced by placing tongue on top of hard palate and flapping
it forward; r at end of syllable is often pronounced as t; between two
vowels it is approximately dr, and when doubled tr, while nr is usually
pronounced as ndr; though distinction formerly existed Tamil n is in
modern speech indistinguishable from n.

We hv seen that Vedic Sanskrit, like Greek, had tonic accent, but this,
again as in Greek, disappeared very early from ordinary speech, its place
being taken by stress accent, as in most European languages. stress is
placed on last prosodically long syllable of word (i.e. syllable
containing either long vowel or short vowel followed by two
consonants) other than final syllable, which never has accent. In a
word with no long syllables accent is on first syllable. E.g. sābhā,
Himalaya, Śakuntalā, ávayava. stress is not as marked as in English.



APPENDIX XI
PROSODY
Like those of classical Europe metres of Indian poetry are
quantitative, based on order of long and short syllables, and not, as in
English, on stress. As in classical European languages syllable was
counted as long if it contained long vowel (ā, ī, ū, r, e, o, ai or au), or a
short vowel followed by two consonants. favourite stanza form at all
times was of four lines or “quarters” (pāda), usually equal, and varying in
length from eight to over twenty syllables each, with full caesura between
the second and third quarters. Most of metres of classical poetry
were set in rigid patterns and not divided into feet, but broken only by one
or two caesure in each quarter. metres of Veda, however, and the
epic sloka metre, allowed considerable variation.

Though most of Vedic hymns r in stanzas of four quarters there are
some with three or five divisions. Of former, one, called Gdyatr, is
common, and is that of famous Gayatri verse quoted on p. 162. It [Page
509] consists of three sections of eight syllables each, first four of which
are free, while last four hv cadence
.

The commonest Vedic stanza is Tristubh, consisting of four quarters of
eleven syllables each. quarter normally has caesura after fourth or
fifth syllable, and is prevailingly iambic. last four syllables of each
quarter hv cadence. For example:
índrasya nu vtridni pra vocam
yini cakira prathamani vajrt.

Ahann Ahim, anu apds tatarda,
pra vaksdnd abhinat parvatdnmn. 12

Similar to this, but with an extra syllable in each quarter, was the
twelvesyllabled Jagatā, with cadence


In later hymns of Rg Veda stanza of four eight-syllable quarters,
called Anustubh, became popular. This was much same as Gayatry, with
a fourth line added, but there was considerable variation in final
cadence. For example:
Sahdsra-sirsd Purusah,
sahasrdksdh, sahdsrapdt.

Sd bhimim visvdto vrtva
dty atisthad dasāngulām.13

From Anustubh of Vedas developed Śloka, chief epic
metre of later times. This consisted of four quarters of eight syllables each,
the first and third normally ending with cadence
, and the
second and fourth with
Certain
specified variations were
allowed. As an example we quote first verse of account of
Damayantī’s translated on p. 409.

Atha kale fubhe prdpte,
tithau pu.nye ksane tathd,
djuhava mahipaldn
Bhimo rdja svayamvare.


The Śloka metre was widely used for poetry of all kinds, especially for
didactic and narrative verse. courtly poets, however, favoured longer
metres, with their quantities rigidly fixed in complicated rhythmic patterns,
some with regular cæsurae. Textbooks describe over 100 metres of this
kind, many with fanciful names, but only some twenty or thirty were
popular. Of these we mention few of most common.

The verses of Bāna quoted on p. 427 r in this metre.

In few rather rare metres first and third quarters differ in length
from second and fourth. commonest of these was Puspitāgrā :
2 x (12+13):

“Aham iha nivasāmi. ydhi Rādhdm,
anunaya madvacanena c’ ānayethāh”.

Iti Madhuripuzā sakhi niyuktā,
svayam idam etya punar jagāda Rādhām.21

As well as metres of this type there r others, scansion of which is
based on number of syllabic instants (mdtrd) in each quarter-verse. The
most common of these is Ārya (“The Lady”). This is divided into feet, each
containing four instants, counting prosodically short sylable as one and a
long syllable as two instants (
.

The first quarter of Ārya stanza contains three such feet; second,
four and half; third, three, and fourth three and half, with an extra
short syllable after second foot. whole of Hala’s SaptaSataka is
written in this metre; for example:
Bhadtantīa tanāim
sotturm dinnāi jāi pahiassa.


Tāi ccea pahāe
ajjdā ādahāī ruanti. 22

[Page 512]
This verse is to be scanned as follows:

The metres employed by Jayadeva in his Gītā Govinda r exceptional,
although imitated by later poets. They r no doubt borrowed from popular
song. stanzas of lyric quoted on p. 429, excluding refrain,
consist of four quarters of nine, eight, nine and ten syllables respectively, all
of which r short except last rhyming syllable in first and third
quarters and penultimate in second and fourth.

The prosody of Tamil poetry differs considerably from that of Sanskrit.

In Tamil basic unit is “metrical syllable” (aśai), which may be a
single syllable or long syllable preceded by short one. Two, three or four
of these form foot, of which line of poetry may contain from two to six
or occasionally more. Complicated rules, which cannot be discussed here,
much restrict order of syllables and feet in line.



APPENDIX XII
THE GYPSIES
Among India’s many gifts to world we must include Gypsies,
who, with their music and dancing, hv formed romantic and colourful
element in European life for over five centuries.

The European Gypsies hv no recollection of their Indian origin, but
have generally claimed to be Egyptians. Russian Gypsies, it is said,
even declare that their ancestors were single soldier of army of
Pharaoh and young girl, who escaped drowning when Moses led the
Israelites over Red Sea. This tradition of Gypsies’ Egyptian origin
was for long taken at its face value, until, in 1763, Hungarian protestant
theological student, Stefan Valyi, published brief paper pointing to the
close similarity between language of Gypsies of his native plains
and that of three Indian theological students whom he had met at the
University of Leyden. It was long before true significance of this fact
was recognized, but it is now universally agreed that Gypsy language,
or Romani, is an Indo-āryan one, and that fact cn only be accounted for
by postulating that Gypsies came from India.

The relationship of Romani to languages of Northern India is very
obvious, even to those with no linguistic training, for many of the
commonest words of Romani r little different from those of India. Thus:

Philologists hv shown by comparison of Romani with Prakrits
and modem Indian languages, that Gypsies originated in Ganges
basin, which they left before time of Aśoka (3rd century B.C.), to reside
for several centuries in North-Western India. Probably even at this time they
were wandering musicians and entertainers. In modem India there is a
lowly caste of such people called Doms, attested since early Middle
Ages, and with this word word Rom, by which Gypsies universally
designate themselves, is probably connected. In Syrian Romani it occurs as
Doum, very close to Indian form.

According to 11th c. Persian poet Firduisī, who collected many
legends and traditions of pre-Muslim Persia in his “Book of Kings” (Shāh-
nāmah), 5th-century Sasanian king Bahram Gur, invited ten thousand
Indian musicians to his realm, and gave dm cattle, corn and asses, that
they might settle in land and entertain his poorer subjects, who had been
complaining that pleasures of music and dance were reserved for the
rich. But musicians refused to settle; they ate cattle and seed-corn
which king had given them, and wandered about land like wolves or
wild dogs.

Though Firdusl’s story may not be wholly accurate, it shows that low
caste Indian musicians were well known in Middle East at very early
time. With Arab conquest of Sind in early 8th century further groups
of Indian entertainers must hv found their way westwards and later have
moved on to Africa and Europe. Folk called Athinganoi r recorded as
living in Constantinople in A.D. 810, and later Byzantine records refer to
these Athinganoi or Azinganoi as magicians and conjurors.

[Page 514] These were probably forerunners of Tsigany bands
who appeared in Central and Western Europe in late Middle Ages. The
earliest record of Gypsies in Europe other than in Balkans is from the
German city of Hildesheim, where passing band is recorded in 1407. A
great horde of Gypsies passed through Basel in 1422, under chief who
called himself Michael, Prince of Egypt. Within few decades they had
overrun all Europe; earliest records show that they had all the
characteristics of their descendants-they were careless, lazy, dirty and
cheerful, skilled in metal work and tinkering, splendid musicians and
dancers, their bodies bedecked with bright garments and jewellery, their
menfolk cunning horsedealers, their womenfolk telling fortunes, and both
sexes losing no opportunity to pilfer from unsuspecting gorjo. It was not
long before Gypsies began to feel fierce persecution which they
were to suffer in most parts of Europe down to present day, when many
Gypsies perished in gas-chambers of Third Reich.

From many loan-words in various dialects of Romani we may
roughly trace course of their migrations. All Romani dialects of
West and Central Europe contain many Greek and South Slavonic words,
which prove that ancestors of our western Gypsies dwelt long in the
Balkans. Spanish Gypsies appear to hv arrived in their new
homeland from two directions, first immigration coming via Egypt and
the north coast of Africa, no doubt during Moorish occupation of
southern Spain, and second, later, over Pyrenees.

Little but their language remains to connect Gypsies with their
original home, and even their speech is full of borrowings from almost
every tongue of Europe and many of Asia. Though Gypsies hv always
tended to marry their own kind, centuries of wandering hv left their mark
on Gypsy type and there r now many fair Gypsies, though others, if
suitably attired, would not seem out of place in modem North Indian city.

On analysis their music is that of lands in which they dwell. Whether in
Hungary, Roumania or Spain, it is based on local folk-song and dance.

Unfortunately English Gypsies hv largely forgotten their traditional
art, but when they sing they sing folk-songs and music-hall ballads; in
Ireland tinkers sing Irish folk-songs. Yet, wherever Gypsies go, their
musicians tend to give their music character of its own. predilection for
ornamentation of melody, especially with quarter-tones, preference for
the minor mode, tendency to introduce progressions by augmented whole
tones into their melodies, and love of complex rhythm, r perhaps
survivals of Indian musical tradition which first Romanis brought
with dm from their homeland. Some Gypsy folktales resemble those of
India, but same may be said of traditional tales of every country of
Europe. few Gypsy customs and beliefs may be genuine Indian survivals.

Though by no means hygienically inclined people, Gypsies hv ideas
of ritual purity and birth and death taboos which remind us of those of
Hinduism. Thus woman in childbirth is impure, and must bear her child
outside her caravan or tent for fear of polluting it. Gypsy midwives are
impure throughout their lives, and r taboo to all respectable [Page 515]
Gypsies, like outcast village midwives of India. Corpses r also
impure, and dying Gypsies r carried from their caravans to end their lives
in open air, for fear of pollution. Gypsy taboo on horse-slaughterers
may hv an Indian origin. But all these resemblances might well be
accounted for otherwise.

The Gypsies have, in fact, forgotten their ancestry. In one respect,
however, they hv kept to traditions of their homeland. Though they
have adapted their ways to time and place, and hv always been open to
new influences, they r still governed by their own laws and their own
code of morality. They hv doggedly retained their individuality against
persecution and persuasion alike-an indepedent social group, transcending
regional and national boundaries, knit together by common customs,
common means of livelihood, and common blood. In this respect they are
Indian. They r caste, as their Indian counterparts, Doms, r caste,
and even innovations of Twentieth Century hv not been able to
destroy their caste solidarity.

1 naksatras were: (1) Aśvinī (β and γ Arietis), (2) Bharani (85, 89,

Abhijit (α, ε, and, δ Lyree), which was placed between Uttara1a{lha and
Srava1)a. It will be seen from this list that ancient Indian system of
constellations differed widely from that of West.

2The names of planets had many synonyms, some of which were
evidently borrowed from Greek, e.g. Ara, Ares, or Mars.

3At “Churning of Ocean” (p. 302) demon named Rahu stole
some of amrta. Visu destroyed his body, but as he had tasted of the
divine drink he had become immortal. His head and tail survive for ever in
the heavens, as Rahu and Ketu, and head causes eclipses by trying to
swallow planets. Of course astronomers did not believe this myth,
and some texts explicitly reject it.

4The names of months in early times were as follows: Madhu,
Madhava, Sukra, Śuci, Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isa, jrja, Sahas, Sahasya, Tapas,
Tapasya. Vedic names r sometimes found in later poetry.

5 Epigraphia Indica, ii, 20.

6 Some earlier authorities, disinclined to give India her due, have
declared that none of these sources gives certain evidence of existence
of sign for zero. But Aryabha-tas’ text implies knowledge of it, and
Severus Sebokht’s “nine symbols” would be quite useless for expressing
quantities over nine without zero sign and place notation. Maya of
Central America had vigesimal numeral system with positional notation
long before this time, but it had, of course, no effect on world at large
(S. G. Morley, Ancient Maya, London, 1946, p. 274).

8 Sanskrit terms for seven aspects are: (1) syadasti, (2) sydnnasti,
(s) syddastindsti, (4) syddavaktavya, (5) syddastyavaktavya, (6)
sydnndstyavaktavya, and (7) syddastindstyavaktavya.
