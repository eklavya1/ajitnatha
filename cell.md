Each cell acquires its structure and ability to function because of the organization of its membrane and organelles in specific ways.
The cell thus has a basic structural organization. This helps the cells to perform functions like respiration, obtaining nutrition, and clearing waste material, or forming new proteins.
Thus, the cell is the fundamental structural unit of living organisms. It is also the basic functional unit of life.
Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids and proteins.
The presence of the cell wall enables the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to exist in hypotonic media without bursting.
The ER functions both as a passageway for intracellular transport and as a manufacturing surface.
The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membrane-bound vesicles that function in the storage, modification and packaging of substances manufactured in the cell.
Most plant cells have large membranous organelles called plastids, which are of two types â€” chromoplasts and leucoplasts.
Chromoplasts that contain chlorophyll are called chloroplasts and they perform photosynthesis. Leucoplasts help in the storage of oils, starch and protein granules.
Most mature plant cells have a large central vacuole that helps to maintain the turgidity of the cell and stores important substances including wastes.
Prokaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, their chromosomes are composed of only nucleic acid, and they have only very small ribosomes as organelles.
A white blood cell (WBC) in human blood is an example of a single cell that can change its shape.
The bacterial cell also has a cell wall.
In egg white material is albumin which solidifies on boiling. The yellow part is the yolk. It is part of a single cell.
Valonia ventricosa, a species of algae with a diameter that ranges typically from 1 to 4 centimetres is among the largest unicellular species.
