reading comprehension class04

reading comprehension on basis of assumption

assumption: it's hidden part of meaning/context in implicit manner.

ex: 2 nations are playing a cricket match. 1st nation has made a big score. india has already lost 2 wickets and now sachin is coming to bat.

general assumptions: good batsman is likely to help team to win; sachin is a good batsman, and india can win match.
specific assumptions: sachin is competent to make india a  winning team, and india should win match.

(i)definite words:  only, best, certainly, specific, etc.

ex: bop crisis has been further worsened o-hence govt should take initiative to boost exports.

assumptions:

bop crisis can be solved to a particular extent by means of exports-this is correct.
bop crisis can definitely be removed by exports-this is incorrect.

(ii)conjunction:  2 clauses/dimensions in 1 statement-joining with help of conjunctions like because, therefore, despite, etc.

ex: literacy scenario can only be developed by awareness program because people get connected to awareness program in vernacular language.
assumptions: national literacy awareness program is a good objective to increase literacy rate-this is correct.

valid assumptions: ex: sachin is batting at 99 scores, his fans will be nervous/exciting-both are valid.

ex: govt has increased price of bread.

invalid assumptions:

bread prices were too low, hence govt increased prices.
govt was under extreme pressure of economic and agricultural distress.

ex: a suggested b to take his son to a medical expert for better medication and quick heal.

invalid assumption: b totally ignores suggestion of a.

assumptions that can be outrightly rejected:

(1) obversion: they change verb, subject, and predicate into a negative character and can change appearance of context.

ex: friendship is beneficial; invalid assumptions: enmity is harmful; enmity is not beneficial; friendship is not harmful.

(2)re-statement: putting statement in diff words.

ex: indian companies manufacturing television. among them, company a is doing maximum sales in a year; invalid assumption: company a is only company that is doing maximum sales in india.

(3)conversion: convert form of statement.

ex: many historians distort facts, which in long run harms overall fabric of society; invalid assumption: people who distort facts which harm fabric of society are all historians.

inferences: evidence from passage.

ex: sohan and rohan are roommates. sohan went to gaya on 16th august. after 2 days rohan too traveled.

inference: sohan and rohan went traveling and they both are not in their homes.
assumption: on 18th august, rohan traveled.
