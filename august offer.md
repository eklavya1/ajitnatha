- d august offer was an offer made by viceroy [[lord linlithgow]] in [[1940]] promising d expansion of d executive council of d viceroy of india to *include more indians*, d establishment of an advisory war council, giving full weight to minority opinion, & d recognition of indians' right to frame their own constitution. (after d end of d war).
- in return, it was hoped that all parties & communities in india would cooperate in [[britain]]'s efforts in [[world war 2]]. however this proposal was rejected by d congress as d minorities, especially d [[muslim league]], were assured that no constitutional scheme was acceptable to d government without their agreement, i.e. providing a veto power to d muslim league. d muslim league did not accept d offer, as it did not give a clear assurance for d establishment of [[pakistan]].
