[[Kashmir]] Himalayas comprise a series of ranges such as the [[Karakoram]], [[Ladakh]], Zaskar and Pir Panjal.
The northeastern part of the Kashmir Himalayas is a cold desert, which lies between the Greater Himalayas and the Karakoram ranges.
Between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal range, lies the world famous valley of Kashmir and the famous [[Dal Lake]].
Important glaciers of South Asia such as the Baltoro and Siachen are also found in this region.
The Kashmir Himalayas are also famous for Karewa formations, which are useful for the cultivation of *Zafran, a local variety of saffron*.
Karewas are the thick deposits of glacial clay and other materials embedded with moraines.
Some of the important passes of the region are Zoji La on the Great Himalayas, Banihal on the Pir Panjal, Photu La on the Zaskar and Khardung La on the Ladakh range.
