Durgawati Devi was actively engaged in the armed revolution against British rule in India.
She was an active member of the revolutionary group "Naujawan Bharat Sabha". Hence, Option 4 is correct.
Naujawan Bharat Sabha was founded by Bhagat Singh in 1926.
Members from the Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh communities were there in the organization.
The public meeting of the association was reduced after the killing of J.P. Saunders in 1928. In the year 1929, the association was banned.
After the assassination of British official JP Saunders, she assisted in the escape of Bhagat Singh and Rajguru via train.
As revenge for the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Devi tried to assassinate Lord Hailey, the former Governor of Punjab.
However, her attempt was not successful, ultimately leading to her imprisonment.
