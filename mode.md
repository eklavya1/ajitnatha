- The mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs *most often*.
- or the most frequent observation in the data [[iron man]] [[tony stark]]

1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4
arrange in ascending form
1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4
count the frequency of each entity
1 = 3 times
2 = *4* times
3 = 1 time
4 = 2 times
since 2 occurs for 4 times so it is the mode of the given data set.
