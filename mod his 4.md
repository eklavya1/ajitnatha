## maratha kingdom

- it was established as a small kingdom in 1600s by shivaji. fought autonomous kingdoms + aurangzeb. 
- shivaji died in [[1680]]. aurangzeb continued to attack. 
- 2 sons of shivaji: rajaram & shambhaji -> continued to resist aurangzeb & died.
- post-death of rajaram in [[1699]], his widow tarabai began ruling in name of infant son shivaji ii.
- shahu- son of shambhaji- was captured & released post-aurangzeb's death in [[1707]]. ( post-[[1705]], aurangzeb had started losing war.)
- [[1701]]7-[[1719]]: period of civil war b/w shahu & tarabai-> internal weakness
- [[1719]]-[[1761]]: period of rise in strength of marathas & rise of peshwas

hierarchy

peshwas
balaji vishwanath ([[1713]]-[[1720]])
bajirao ([[1720]]-40)
balaji bajirao/ nana saheb ([[1740]]-61)
young peshwa madhav rao ([[1761]]-72) assisted by important minister nana fadnis or phadnavis
raghunath rao ([[1773]]-74)-> murdered narayan rao (next in line); took help of [[eic]] to be peshwa.
he was removed by nana fadnis-> infant peshwa madhav rao was made peshwa. 
[[1795]]: suicide by madhav rao-ii  b/c of high handed attitude of nana fadnis
[[1795]]: son of raghunath rao baji rao ii ([[1796]]-[[1818]])- took help of east india company to continue to be peshwa-> he was last peshwa.
nana fadnis died in [[1800]].

trends in internal polity of marathas

post-[[1719]]: rise in concentration of power in peshwas. 
post-[[1761]]: after death of nana saheb, there was a rise in factionalism in marathas
post-[[1795]]: after suicide by madhav rao ii, opposition to nana fadnis increased. factionalism increased.
post-[[1800]]: further increase in factionalism.
role of eic: post-[[1772]] with raghunath rao's help. 

## important sections in maratha polity
maratha chiefs-> military leaders
deshmukh (revenue administration + law & order)-> they had heritable watan rights.
patil-> village headmen with all powers concentrated in them 
chitpavan brahmans-> very influential politically
brahmin banking families
mirasidars-> landowners with watan rights (heritable)

## reasons for turmoil of maratha kingdom post-death of shivaji
continous conquest by [[aurangzeb]]
factionalism- deshmukhs & zamindars frequently switched sides b/w mughals & marathas
marathas survived mughals but 40 years of wars weekend them. it was only by [[1705]], that marathas started winning. 
however, there was a civil war from [[1707]]-[[1719]] b/w shahu & tarabai. this added to internal weakness of marathas & maratha sardars, deshmukhs & zamindars kept shifting their loyalties b/w shahu, tarabai, & mughals. 
stability was finally achieved by [[1707]] when shahu won civil war

## reasons why shahu won civil war
he was able to get support of important brahmin banking families
important role of brilliant leaders balaji vishwanath who was peshwa of shahu.
rise in support of new maratha sardars: bhonsle (nagpur), gaikwad (baroda), scindia (gwalior), holkar (indore)
later shahu resolved dispute with tarabai by giving her kolhapur by treaty of warna [[1731]]. 

## rise of marathas
maratha sacked delhi & then they defeated mughal army commanded by chin qulich khan via treaty of bhopal [[1739]].
got sovereignty over malwa, i.e. over territory b/w river chambal & narmada. 
gujarat & malabar coast
bengal vs marathas: marathas got odisha in [[1751]] from alivardi khan. 
[[1752]]: mughals came under protection of marathas  b/c of threat of afgan invasion. 
by [[1752]], marathas had become supreme power in india.
in [[1761]]: loss of marathas in 3rd battle of panipat. it was a big blow to marathas-> factioanlis in marathas ↑ in absence of strong peshwas. (rise of nana phadnavis)
marathas vs rajputs: they were not able to crush rajputs completely, however, marathas interfered in their wars of succession to put their favorites in power & extracted annual tributes, i.e, share in revenue.
marathas tried to dominate sikhs but failed. 
by middle of 18th century, marathas dominated foll areas:
deccan: dominant power; were sovereign over maharashtra
gujarat: control over 60% of revenue ([[1728]])
sovereignty over khandesh ([[1751]]), malwa([[1739]]), domination over konkan coast.
[[1751]]: chauth of bengal & bihar
[[1750]]: extracted tributes from rajputs

## maratha administration

- **swarajya**
- rule by peshwa from poona
- it's land of maharashtra which was culturally homogenous & established by shivaji.
- each province was under a governor. 
- **samrajya**
- #wo_de a wish had there been one indian roman empire !!! would have been so good -- [[youtube whatifalthist]]
- land outside maharashtra & rule by maratha chiefs aka maratha confederacy.
- main concern of peshwas was to get revenue from maratha sardars-> peshwas not interested in its governance. 

## other aspects of maratha administration
- hq: satara
- secretariat: poona
- governors of provinces in svarajya were kept under strong supervision.
- autonomy provided at village level.
- land revenue (lr) & farmers: lr was fixed on basis of quality of soil, irrigation facilities, crop sown. to aid peasants, various measures were taken: construction of small dams & canals; cheap loans were given, etc.
- sources of revenue: lr, custom duties, octroi, judicial proceeds. 
- sardeshmukhi: 1/10th of revenue for commission of deshmukhs for their services. services provided by deshmukhs: l&o; revenue collection. 
- chauth: 1/4th of revenue levied on areas outside maratha dominion-> protection money.
- policing was as efficient as london police with a proper network of informants. 
- army: major component was horse-mounted army; infant not that strong.
- navy: 700 ships. they were able to defeat portuguese in [[1736]] in konkan. 
- saranjams: they were like tankha jagirs, but vatan jagirs dominated.
- mughal bureaucracy had civil + military functions, but maratha bureaucracy only had civil functions. 

## reasons why marathas could not become all india power
**- #wo_de  like d yellow turban revolt in ancient [[china]]**
- mainly interested in tribute from areas outside maharashtra & not in setting up their governance.
- defeat in 3rd battle of panipat
- proper centralization of [[power]] was never there. [[bureaucracy]] [[china]]
- continous warfare with regional powers.
