agricultural emissions in [[india]] -
Agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally.
The growing global population is putting pressure on agricultural production systems that aim to secure food production while minimizing GHG emissions.
In this study, the GHG emissions associated with the production of major food commodities in India are calculated using the Cool Farm Tool.
GHG emissions, based on farm management for major crops (including cereals like wheat and rice, pulses, potatoes, fruits, and vegetables) and livestock-based products (milk, eggs,
chicken, and mutton meat), are quantified and compared.
In India, the agriculture and livestock sector account for 18% of gross national emissions, 3rd highest sector after energy and industry.
Most of the emissions from Indian agriculture are from states like Punjab, Haryana, UP, Bihar, West Bengal, etc.
**The share of emissions from different sections of agriculture are -**
Livestock Products-38.9%
Rice-36.9%
Ruminant Meat-12.5%
Others-4.8%
Cereals-3.2%
Pulses-2.1%
Fruits-I. 1%
potato - 0.4%
