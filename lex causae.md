- lex causae (latin for "law of the cause"), in conflict of laws,  is the law chosen by the forum court from the relevant legal systems when it judges an international or interjurisdictional case. it refers to the usage of particular local laws as the basis or "cause" for the ruling, which would itself become part of referenced legal canon.

- conflict of laws regulates all lawsuits involving foreign law if the outcome of a legal action would differ by the laws applied. once the forum court has ruled that it has jurisdiction to hear the case, it must then decide which possible law is to be applied.

- if the parties and the causes of action are local, the court will apply the lex fori, the prevailing municipal law. if there are foreign elements to the case, the forum court, under conflict of laws, will consider which law will apply.
