it's alloy that exhibits excellent mechanical strength & resistance to creep (tendency for solids to slowly move or deform under stress) at high temperatures; good surface stability; & corrosion & oxidation resistance. 
a superalloy's base alloying element is usually nickel, cobalt, or nickel-iron.
superalloys develop bigh-temperature strength through solid solution strengthening.
oxidation or corrosion resistance is provided by elements such as aluminium & chromium.
applications of superalloys include gas turbines (commercial & military aircraft, power generation, & marine propulsion); space vehicles; submarines; nuclear reactors; military electric motors; racing & high-performance vehicles, chemical processing vessels, bomb casings. eg. turbine blades for hot sections of jet engines, & bi-metallic engine valves for use in diesel & automotive applications
exs of superalloys are hastelloy, inconel (e.g. inioo), waspaloy, rene alloys (e.g. rene 41, rene 80), haynes alloys, incoloy, mp98t, tms alloys, & cmsx (e.g. cmsx-4) single crystal alloys.
