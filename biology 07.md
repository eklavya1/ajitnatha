# summary



genetic disorders

abnormality in chromosome number

down's syndrome: there is a presence of additional chromosome [[number]] 21, also k/a trisomy 21. in this case, child has a small round head, partial open mouth, & mental retardation. 
klinefelter's syndrome: a male with [[development]] of feminine characteristics. due to presence of 1 extra chromosome xxx & y, male will be sterile.
[[turner's syndrome]]: she is a sterile female, a condition that affects only females, results when 1 of x chromosomes (sex chromosomes) is missing or partially missing. (xo)

gene defects

    autosomal [[disease]]:
    ex: sickle cell anaemia-> shape of rbcs is altered-> less haemoglobin(hb) is stored-> resulting in anaemia
    sex-linked:
    most of them are linked to x chromosomes.
    exs- colour blindness, haemophilia.

biotechnology

    it's application of living organisms in any form for human benefit through means of genetical engineering.

recombinant [[dna]] [[technology]]:

    it's dna formed by combination of diff fragments of dna 
    steps involved:  
    separation of desired genes 
    enzymes: cutting dna-> nuclease & joining dna-> ligase 
    vector- dna that carries desired gene. eg: plasmid- independent circular dna found in bacteria
    vector joins desired gene forming recombinant dna
    recombinant dna inserted back to get desired function.

gene editing

    we can add delete or replace genes 
    once it's used for treatment medicinal purposes then c/a gene therapy 
    gene editing can be done in embryo, somatic cells, & germ cells 
    gene editing tool
    clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats or crispr or molecular scissors 
    crispr has single guided rna which is also c/a sgrna
    cas 9 protein or enzyme: dna cutting enzyme or nuclease
    crispr guides cas9 enzymes to specific parts so that enzyme can cut dna at those specific cites 

cloning

    it's creating organism from existing organism which is going to be exact replica of organism
    currently not been done on human beings
    still being practised mainly on animals ex - dolly sheep (first cloned mammal)
    process- donor cell culture - matured oocytes- enucleation-nuclear transfer- cell fusion-coned embryo [[development]]

in vitro fertilization  

    means fertilization in lab - will take ovum(female) & sperms(male) & will make zygote in lab 
    will stimulate this zygote to form embryo - also c/a test-tube baby 
    we can transplant embryo in female uterus 

three parent baby

    mitochondrial dna: inherited only from mother
    defective mt-dna can cause [[disease]]. eg: leigh [[disease]]
    thus, a donor's egg with normal mt dna is used, thereby involving 3 parents. (pronuclear transfer)

stem cells 

    they are unspecialised cells that can divide & grow into diff types of cells 
    totipotent cells can form all cells of body including those of extraembryonic tissue (placenta)
    ex of totipotent cell - zygote 
    pluripotent cells can form any cell in body except those needed to support & develop foetus or embryo 
    types of stem cells 
    embryonic stem cells 
    exist at early stages of life & can change into any type of cell in body 
    adult stem cells 
    they are present in diff tissues & diffiate into cells of that particular tissue 
    they are found in bone marrow, skin, brain, spinal cord
    induced pluripotent cells -
    normal diffiated cells of body can be induced to divide & become undiffiated again 
    applications of stem cells 
    in case of damage or any other organ became dysfunctional can be replaced with bodies own capacity 
    we can create new cells, tissues, new organs 
    in place of organ transplant, own organs can be stimulated with help of stem cells & can give that as a transplant 
    skin grafts can be given using new skin cells 
    muscle & bone injuries can be repaired 
    it's only sole treatment in areas where there is no alternative 
    this will be a revolutionary line of treatment for ex  in case of blood cancer under which there is 1 type of blood cells that is not being formed because of other cells then stem cells can be used to stimulate those cells to produce blood cells which are not being formed 
    it has a lot of applications in research & development, for ex, orthopaedic surgeries, brain traumas etc 

biotechnology 

    grey biotechnology
    for environment ex oil zapper bacteria, bioremediation
    oil zapper is a bacteria used to clear oil spills 
    blue biotechnology
    for marine usage
    white biotechnology
    used for detergent containing enzymes presence of activated enzymes which helps in removing oil & greeze
    green biotechnology for [[agriculture]] 
    red biotechnology
    for medical purposes exs gene editing, dna vaccine, rna vaccine 
    direct introduction of vaccine encoding for antigen against which immune response is needed 
    so production of target antigen takes place inside body of person who is vaccinated 
    white biotechnology for industrial ex detergents containing enzymes 
    green biotechnology
    for agriculture ex gm crops 
    gm crops - genetically modified crops 
    why gm crop is required 
    for a high yield of crops ex - gm mustard 
    pest resistance of crops ex - for ex, bt cotton 
    nutrients - golden rice - vit a 
    increased shelf life ex - flavr saver tomato 
    concerns with gm crops 
    health concerns may develop unidentified disease in coming times 
    environment - when a new crop is introduced it disturbs existing ecosystem 
    terminator seeds - they don't grow into new crops, therefore, mnc is benefited from this & may create monopolies of diff mncs 

biotechnology challenges 

    finances - resources, govt assistance etc 
    awareness issues - people don't understand a lot of things about biotechnology 
    regulation - over-regulated 
    ethical issue - biggest ethical issue involved is it's against natural order 
    religious issues - they equate this process to murder when you kill embryo etc 
    consent issue - in terms of any [[technology]] with respect to baby, a baby who has not been born can give consent 
    note: for plant biology: focus on modification & adaptations
