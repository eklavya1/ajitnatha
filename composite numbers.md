	- In Mathematics, composite numbers are numbers that have more than two factors. These numbers are also called composites. Composite numbers are just the opposite of prime numbers which have only two factors, i.e. 1 and the number itself. All the natural numbers which are not prime numbers are composite numbers as they can be divided by more than two numbers. For example, 6 is a composite number because it is divisible by 1, 2, 3 and even by 6. In this article, we will learn the definition of composite numbers, properties, smallest composite number, even and odd composite numbers, list of composite numbers, and difference between prime and composite numbers along with many solved examples in detail.
	- Zero (0) is considered as neither prime nor a composite number because it does not have any factors.
