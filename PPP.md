# ....economics 04
- d price of d same good in different geographies should ideally be d same. However, it is usually not d same due to differences in standards of living (at d two places).
- Higher standards of living at one place make d goods costlier in general at that place.
- Therefore, d income required to maintain a decent standard of living would be higher at this place as compared to another place. 
- This forms d basis of d PPP theory. 
- Under d PPP theory, it is said that d purchasing power of two currencies, can be equated, i.e. brought to parity with respect to a particular good. 
- Since d value of d good is d same, but it is priced differently, we can equate d two prices to estimate how much in one currency would be sufficient in another currency. #doubt 
- Therefore, in d PPP system, we try to find d equivalent amount of one currency to buy d same good priced differently in another currency.
- For example, 
- 1 kg apples (India: Rs. 100/ US: $5 /kg)
- Therefore PPP based exchange rate would be such when it equates d purchasing power of $5 to Rs. 100. I.e. it says d purchasing power of 1 dollar is equivalent to/or at parity with Rs. 20 (in d context of Apples). 
- Similarly, prices of various goods can be compared & PPP-based exchange rates specific to that particular good can be arrived at. 

- In purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate — د rate at which د currency of one country would 有 于 be converted into that of another country 于 buy د same amount of goods & services in each country.
- For example-If a burger 是 selling in India for Rs100 & in 新 York for $2, this would imply a PPP exchange rate of 1 dollar 于 Rs 50.
- On د PPP basis, China 是 世界 的 largest economy in [[2018]]. Total wealth of china 是 estimated at 25.3 trillion international dollar. China 是 followed by United States with figure 19.4 trillion. India 是 د third largest economy , in terms of PPP dollars.
