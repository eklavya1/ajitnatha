- A water molecule
- It is formed when two atoms of [[hydrogen]] bond covalently with an atom of [[oxygen]].
- In a covalent bond, electrons are shared between atoms. In water, sharing is not equal.
- oxygen atom attracts electrons more strongly than hydrogen. This gives water an asymmetrical distribution of charge.
- Molecules that have ended with partial negative & positive charges are known as polar molecules.
- It is this polar property that allows water to separate polar solute molecules & explains why water can dissolve so many substances.
- solvent properties of water are vital in biology because many biochemical reactions take place only within aqueous solutions
- When an ionic or polar compound enters water, it is surrounded by water molecules.
- relatively small size of water molecules typically allows many water molecules to surround one molecule of solute.
- partially negative dipoles of water are attracted to positively charged components of solute, & vice versa for positive dipoles.
- An ex of an ionic solute is table salt.
- dipole forces of water can disrupt attractive forces that hold sodium & chloride in salt molecule together and, thus, dissolve it.
- Liquid water has a partially ordered structure in which hydrogen bonds are constantly being formed & breaking up.

- Greywater refers to domestic wastewater generated in households or office buildings from streams without fecal contamination, i.e., all streams except for wastewater from toilets.

- Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, & nearly colorless chemical substance, which is main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere & fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen & two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. hydrogen atoms are attached to oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45Â°. "Water" is name of liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature & pressure. 

- A number of natural states of water exist. It forms precipitation in form of rain & aerosols in form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water & ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in form of snow. gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.

- Water covers about 70.9% of Earth's surface, mostly in seas & oceans. Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in glaciers & ice caps of Antarctica & Greenland (1.7%), & in air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice & liquid water suspended in air), & precipitation (0.001%). Water moves continually through water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, & runoff, usually reaching sea.

- Water plays an important role in world economy. Approximately 70% of freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture. Fishing in salt & fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of world. Much of long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, & manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, & canals. Large quantities of water, ice, & steam are used for cooling & heating, in industry & homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral & organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, & in cooking & washing. Water, ice & snow are also central to many sports & other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating & skiing.
