- The model of growth which has been pursued by almost all countries has been Trickle Down Model.
- The approach focuses upon a few high potential sectors/regions in the economy so that the limited resources can be utilized effectively and more growth can occur in the economy.
- More growth is expected to translate into more [[employment]] and higher [[income]]s.
- This approach to growth is “inequality creating” _by design_, i.e. - the growth model itself identifies a few areas where high growth can occur and more resources can be generated.
- Trickle-down is also a pro-poor approach ( #doubt maybe it is the opposite 反 ) to growth wherein the resources and efforts of the economy are focused to generate more resources which can then be trickled down to those who were left out.
- Even though the trickle-down has been the preferred model due to the high efficiency of utilization of limited resources, its success in being pro-poor is conditioned upon certain specific assumptions. These assumptions are as follows:
	- Whether the chosen sector actually delivers on growth.
	- Whether the high growth results in government collecting more taxes - [[Tax Buoyancy]]. _related_ [[gst]] | [[tax]] | [[]]
	- Whether higher taxes collected are invested in the welfare of the bottom population or are they invested for the high potential sector.
	- [[efficiency]] of government expenditure on welfare. _related_ [[asian efficiency]] | [[fs blog]] | [[personal MBA]]
	- As the success of the trickle-down model of growth is conditioned on assumptions, and thus the bottom remains a passive recipient. It has been seen that inequalities existing today in India can be explained to some degree by the approach.

-   " Trickle Down Approach to Growth" is the pro-poor approach to growth wherein the limited resources are initially focused so that more can be generated which can then be spent on those at the bottom.
-   The Trickle-Down Approach has a flaw in that it creates certainty for those at the top to benefit whereas the bottom only remains a _passive beneficiary_.
-   Note: The detailed dictation on the Trickle-down approach will be provided in the next class.

- Trickle down is one of the theories of economics. However it is also _contested and not accepted by all sections_. The argument given against it is that it increases the inequality as not all people are of equal capacity to benefit from the system. Privileged sections corner most benefits.
