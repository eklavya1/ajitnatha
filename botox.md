Botox is a [[drug]] made from a toxin produced by the #species bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It's the same toxin that causes a life- threatening type of food poisoning called *botulism*.
Doctors use it in small doses to treat health problems, including -
Temporary smoothing of facial wrinkles and improving your appearance
Severe underarm sweating
Cervical dystonia - a neurological disorder that causes severe neck and shoulder muscle contractions

Botox is a neurotoxin. These substances target the nervous system, disrupting the nerve signaling processes that stimulate muscle contraction. This is how the drug causes temporary muscle paralysis.
In order for any muscle to contract, the nerves release a chemical messenger called acetylcholine at the junction where nerve endings meet muscle cells.Acetylcholine attaches to receptors on the muscle cells and causes the cells to contract, or shorten.
Botox injections prevent the release of acetylcholine, which stops the muscle cells from contracting. In this way, the toxin helps the muscles to become less stiff.
