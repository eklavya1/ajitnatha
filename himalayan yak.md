<u>Bos grunniens</u>
This is a long-haired domesticated cattle found throughout the Himalayan region of [[India]].
The increasing trend of temperature at high altitudes and heat stress in Himalayan Yak during warmer months of the year are resulting in frequent deaths of Himalayan Yak which is also causing a financial burden on yak owners.
The countrywide population trend also shows that the Yak population has been decreasing at an alarming rate. As per the 20th livestock census, the Yak population is just 58,000 down from around 80,000 in 2012.
To arrest this trend, recently National Research Centre on Yak (NRCY) at Dirang in Arunachal Pradesh West Kameng district has tied up with the National Insurance Company Ltd. to insuring this gentle giant and providing relief to the owners.
NRCY was established in 1989 by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.
Yak is accustomed to very cold temperatures and can survive up to minus 40 degrees but finds it difficult when the temperature crosses 13 degrees.
Yak can efficiently conserve its body heat during cold weather conditions and has minimal body mechanism to dissipate heat by way of sweating.
Domestic Yaks weigh from 400 to 550 Kilograms. Wild yaks are much larger, sometimes weighing up to 1200 Kilograms. Males are larger than females, with more massive horns.
Yak is found throughout the Himalayan region of the Indian subcontinent, the Tibetan Plateau, Northem Myanmar, Yunnan, Sichuan and as far north as Mongolia and Siberia. Thus it is not endemic to India.
