- Toad is a common name for certain [[frog]]s, especially of the family Bufonidae, that are characterized by dry, leathery skin, short legs, and large bumps covering the parotoid glands.A distinction between frogs and toads is not made in scientific taxonomy, but is common in popular culture (folk taxonomy), in which toads are associated with drier, rougher skin and more terrestrial habitats.In scientific taxonomy, toads include the true toad and various false toads including Ansonia malayana and Telmatobufo.
