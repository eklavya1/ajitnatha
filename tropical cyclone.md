The rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind. This force is called the Coriolis force after the French physicist who described it in [[1844]].
The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator.
Tropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges.
The eye is a region of calm with subsiding [[air]].
Around the eye is the eyewall, where there is a strong spiralling ascent of air to a greater height reaching the tropopause.
The air at the Inter-TropicaI Convergence Zone ([[ITCZ]]) rises because of convection caused by high insolation and low pressure is created.
The winds from the tropics converge at this low-pressure zone. The converged air rises along with the convective cell. It reaches the top of the troposphere up to an altitude of 14 km and moves towards the poles. This causes accumulation of air at about 300 N and S. Part of the accumulated air sinks to the ground and forms a subtropical high.

It originates and intensifies over warm tropical oceans.
**The conditions favorable for the formation and intensification of tropical storms are -**
Large sea surface with a temperature higher than 270 C;
Presence of the Coriolis force.
o Small variations in the vertical wind speed;
o A pre-existing weak low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation
Upper divergence above the sea level system.
The cyclones, which cross 200N latitude generally, recurve and they are more destructive (cyclones do not form near the equator due to the absence of Coriolis force).
A mature tropical cyclone is characterized by the strong spirally circulating wind around the center, called the eye.
The diameter of the circulating system can vary between 150 and 250 km.
The eye is a region of calm with subsiding air.
Around the eye is the eyewall, where there is a strong spiraling ascent of air to a greater height reaching the tropopause.
The wind reaches maximum velocity in this region, reaching as high as 250 km per hour.
Torrential rain occurs here.
From the eyewall, rain bands may radiate and trains of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds may drift into the outer region.
The diameter of the storm over the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian ocean is between 600 and 1200 km.
