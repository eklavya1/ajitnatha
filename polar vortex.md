- polar vortex is a large area of low pressure & cold air surrounding both of earth's poles.
- it was also known as polar pig.
- term "vortex" refers tocounterclockwise flow of air that helps keepcolder air nearpoles.
- it always exists nearpoles, but weakens in summer & strengthens in winter.
- however, many times during winter innorthem hemisphere,polar vortex will expand, sending cold air southward.
- this occurs fairly regularly during wintertime & is often associated with large outbreaks of arctic air inunited states & portions of europe & asia.
- it is also not a feature that exists atearth's surface, rather it exists tens of thousands of feet up inatmosphere.
- usually, whenvortex is strongest, cold air is less likely to plunge deep into north america or europe. in other words, it forms a wall that protectsmid latitudes from cold arctic air.
- but occasionally,polar vortex is disrupted & weakens, due to wave energy propagating upward fromlower atmosphere.
- when this happens,stratosphere warms sharply in an event known as sudden *stratospheric warming*, in just a few days, miles above earth's surface.
