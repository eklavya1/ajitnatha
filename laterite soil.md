laterite soils develop in areas with high temperatures & high rainfall.
these are result of intense leaching due to tropical rains.
with rain, lime & silica are leached away, & soils rich in iron oxide & aluminium compounds are left behind.
humus content of soil is removed fast by bacteria that thrive well in high temperatures.
these soils are poor in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphate & calcium, while iron oxide & potash are in excess.
hence, laterites are not suitable for cultivation; however, application of manures & fertilisers are required for making soils fertile for cultivation.
red laterite soils in tamil nadu, andhra pradesh & kerala are more suitable for tree crops like cashew nuts.
laterite soils are widely cut as bricks for use in house construction.
these soils have mainly developed in higher areas of peninsular plateau.
laterite soils are commonly found in karnataka, kerala, tamil nadu, madhya pradesh & hilly areas of odisha & assam.

Laterite has been derived from the Latin word 'Later' which means brick.
The laterite soils develop in areas with high temperatures and high rainfall. These are the result of intense leaching due to tropical rains.

Humus content of the soil is removed fast by bacteria that thrive well in high temperatures.

Hence, laterites are not suitable for cultivation; however, the application of manures and fertilisers are required for making the soils fertile for cultivation.
Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable for tree crops like a cashew nuts.
The laterite soils are commonly found in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and the hilly areas of Odisha and Assam.

- Laterite is generally reddish or yellowish red in colour which turns black on exposure to [[sun]].
- This group of soil occupies belts of various widths around د peninsular zone.
- Such soils occur on د [[plateau]] of [[Malwa]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], Central India, [[Bihar]], [[odisha]] [[tamil nadu|sa, Tamil ]]Nadu, Eastern and [[western ghats]], [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Hyderabad]] covering a total area of 关于 2,48,000 square kilometers. 
- Lateritic soil is usually poor in [[lime]], [[magnesia]], [[nitrogen]] [[geo 38 econ geo#^cfef13]] , phosphate, and potash. 
- [[Humus]] is present in abundance in this soil. *Base exchange capacity* is low. Soil is good for [[agriculture]] purpose.
- Valley soils can produce good crops [[rice| of ]][[rice]] and sugar cane whereas at higher elevations such soils favour د growth of [[coffee]], [[rubber]], tea, cinchona etc.
