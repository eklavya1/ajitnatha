temperate deciduous forests grow in areas with moderate average temperatures that change significantly with season.
these areas have long, warm summers, cold but not too severe winters, & abundant precipitation often spread fairly evenly throughout year.
this biome is dominated by a few species of broadleaf deciduous trees such as oak, hickory, maple, poplar, & beech.
they survive cold winters by dropping their leaves in fall & becoming dormant through winter.
each spring, they grow new leaves whose colours change in fall into array of reds & golds before leaves drop.
 b/c of a slow rate of decomposition, these forests accumulate a thick layer of slowly decaying leaf litter, which is a storehouse of nutrients.
on a global basis, this biome has been disturbed by human activity more than any other terrestrial biome. hence, option 3 is correct answer.
many forests have been cleared for growing crops or developing urban areas.
however, within 100â€”200 years, abandoned cropland can return to a deciduous forest through secondary ecological succession.
temperate deciduous forests of eastern united states were once home to such large predators as bears, wolves, foxes, wildcats, & mountain lions (pumas).
today, most of predators have been killed or displaced, & dominant mammal species often is white-tailed deer, along with smaller mammals such as squirrels, rabbits, opossums, raccoons, & mice.
these are found in northeastem part of usa, china, new zealand, chile & also found in coastal regions of western europe.
common trees are oak, ash, beech, etc. deer, foxes, wolves are animals commonly found.
birds like pheasants, monals are also found here.
