- constituted under Section 171 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.
- The anti-profiteering clause under the Goods And Services Tax (GST)  Act mentions that any reduction in the rate of tax on any goods or services or the benefit of input tax credit must be passed on to the consumer by the way of commensurate reduction in the prices of the respective goods or services. The Central government, for this purpose, can set up a body to ensure that the anti-profiteering clause is being implemented in word and deed. Therefore, a National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) is constituted as per the ‘anti-profiteering rules’. The intention is to ensure that all the stakeholders yield equal benefits of [GST](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/goods-and-services-tax-gst/) and to bolster consumer confidence.
