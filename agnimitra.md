Agnimitra was the son of Pushyamitra Sunga.
He ruled the Sunga Empire from 149 BC to 141 BC.
By the time Agnimitra succeeded to the throne, the Vidarbha region broke away from the Sunga empire and became independent.
He is mentioned in Kalidasa's most acclaimed poem Malavikagnimitram.
After Agnimitra, his son Sujyeshta and his son Vasumitra succeeded to the throne.
