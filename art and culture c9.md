1:09 pm: jainism continues...

three jewels of jainism:
right knowledge, right faith, right conduct
jain councils:
1st council = 299 bc under patronage of bindusar at patliputra, presided by jian monk sthulabhadra -most important initiative of this council was a compilation of teachings of all tirthankaras into 14 books k/a purvas
later when jain monk bhadrabahu returned from shravanbelagola there was ideological feud b/w him & sthulabhadra. as such it led to division of jainism into 2 formal sects-
1) shwetambar (while clads) = liberal sect of jainism & they continued to wear white cloth,
2) digambar (sky clads) = they were orthodox followers of jainism, they remained naked all time.
2nd council = held in 512 ad at valabhi in gujarat, it was patronized by chalukyas of gujarat & presided by jain monk devardhi kshema shramana, in this council majority of jain literature were compiled which are as follows=
anga, upnga, prakirnas, moolasutra, chedaksutra, & bhagvatisutra
metaphysical thoughts of jainism:
on universe = they believed that universe was created as per laws of nature
on vedas = they rejected divine authority of vedas
on god = they maintained that if at all there is any god-like entity then he must be below tirthankars & tirthankaras were supreme authority
on rebirth = they believed in rebirth
on soul = they believed in 2 types of soul is inonimate soul (in non-living matters like water, stone, pebble, etc.) & anonimate soul ( in living beings)
subsects of jainism:
terapanthi, mulapanthi, bispanthi, sthanakvasi, gumanapanthi, 

1:44 pm: q. buddhism when it was born & flourished in india but in early medieval times it started to decline & disappear from its own place of birth. discuss reasons.

once buddha said to his cousin anand that if women are allowed into sangha then buddhism which is going to survive for more than 1000s of years will vanish within 1000 years from its own place of birth.
on insistence of anand buddha allowed entry of women into sangha but later his words proved to be true.
1. monks became corrupt & they started to lead a luxurious life & discarded simplicity, they started to interfere in political affairs of kingdom because of which many kings stopped their patronage to buddhism, they discarded language of public & started practicing elite language sanskrit. sanskrit was a complex language not to be easily understood by common public. it led to dilution of buddhism.
2. quick division of buddhism into n-number of sects further created confusion regarding original tenets of buddhism.
3. with arrival of guptas there was a great tendency of reform in hinduism. concept of bhakti was emphasized rather than animal sacrifice. moreover, hindu religion was consolidated with construction of hindu temples & compilation of majority of hindu literature, which further emboldened faith of people in hinduism. hindu bodies projected buddha as 9th reincarnation of lord vishnu which tries to assimilate concept of buddhism in hinduism.
4. there was very high missionary zeal in buddhism which angered many people & they became anti-buddhism, on other hand, jainism was a small religious community & older than buddhism always maintained its presence in their own place of birth. jaina never displayed a missionary zeal & they never tried to cut off their complete links with caste hinduism. though they were opposed to flaws of caste society but not caste in itself. buddhists on other hand was highly critical of caste society which was not well taken by many people in indian society
5. with arrival of islamic rulers in india there was a successful attempt by them to destroy buddhist legacy from india for eg. burning of nalanda university.

## samkhya philosophy
founder = kapil muni
early samkhya philosophy believed that universe owes its origin to nature but later samkhya philosophers maintained that universe owes its origin not only to nature but also to divine agency (god)
samkhya philosophy is often referred to as dvaitvada (dualism). it believed in 2 realities, that is, purush (inner consciousness) & prakriti (elements of nature)
samkhya philosophy says that recognition of 2 realities is real knowledge & it leads to path of enlightenment.
samkhya philosophy mentioned 3 sources of real knowledge that is -
1) pratyaksha = perception
2) anuman = inference
3) shabda = testimony

## yoga philosophy
3:04 pm: yoga philosophy:

founder = patanjali (yogasutra)
samkhya & yoga is considered as a yugma as both believed in dualism, that is, purush & prakriti
yoga philosophy emphasizes ashtanga yoga as a path of salvation (8 limbs of yoga)
1. yama = dont's 2. niyama = do's, 3. asana = posture, 4. pranayama = breathing control, 5. pratyahara = restraint, 6. dharana = selecting object for concentration, 7. dhyana = concentrating on object, 8. samadhi = deep meditation

## nyaya philosophy

nyaya believes in 4 pramanas of knowledge =

## vedanta philosophy
vedanta philosophy:

also k/a uttarmimamsa, last reflection of vedas
early vedanta thought belongs to bhadrayana but most popular vedanta philosophy belongs to shankracharaya & ramanujacharaya
1. adviatavada (non-dualism) = founder shankracharaya, he highly emphasized on mahavakya "aham brahmasmi" which means god is within oneself. he says that there is no difference b/w creator & created but difference that we perceive is because of our ignorance. this ignorance can be eliminated by embarking on path of knowledge (gyanamarga) which will lead 1 to salvation.
2. vishistadviatavada (qualified non-dualism) = founded by ramanujacharaya, though this philosophy believed in 1 reality but maintained that god has some sp. attributes which can only be realized by embarking on path of devotion (bhaktimarga). it highly recommended bhaktimarga for attainment of salvation.
