sound is a form of [[energy]] & is produced by vibrations.
they are longitudinal & mechanical in nature.
sound waves can travel from 1 medium to another medium & when they do so there will be a change in speed & wavelength but not in [[frequency]].
sound waves with a frequency in range of (0-20 hz) are c/a infrasonic waves.
sound waves with frequency range (20-20000 hz) are c/a audible ranges.
sound waves with a frequency greater than 20000 hz are c/a ultrasonics.

speed of sound waves -
	is 332m/sec in air.
	is minimum in gases & maximum in solids.
	increases in humid conditions. 
	increases with rise in temperature.

sound waves can undergo [[reflection]], [[refraction]], & [[diffraction]].
velocity of sound in air is independent of pressure.
this is because, for ideal [[gas]] equation, it has been seen that [[pressure]] & [[density]] terms contribute equivalently to [[speed]] of sound thereby cancelling each other & leading to persistence of only effect of [[temperature]].

sound is produced by vibrating object.
vibrations cause compressions [high pressure] & rarefaions [low pressure].
sound waves travel through a medium
sound waves are longitudinal i.e. individual particles of a medium move in a direion parallel to direion of propagation of disturbance.
particles don't move physically but oscillate back & forth.
in humans, voice box or larynx has 2 vocal cords that produce sound through vibration when lungs force air through them.
vocal cords in males are 20mm, women 15mm & children even shorter.

## speed of sound
speed of sound remains almost same for all frequencies in a given medium under same physical conditions. intensity is amount of sound
energy passing through a unit area it's from loudness.
two sounds of equal intensity can be of loudness.
speed of sounds is highest in solids & least in gases.
it increases with temperature of medium. sound travels through solids, liquids, gases but not through a vacuum.

## applications of sound
ultrasonic sounds above 20 khz.
applications like cleaning instruments, detecting cracks in building, machines, ultrasound machines & echocardiographs, sonar.
all depend on detection of reflected ultrasonic waves from obstacles, body parts etc.
doppler effect is observed when a movinc object causes a change in frequency of em waves.
in military, it's used to detect enemy aircraft.
in astronomy, it's used to find speed of moving stars.
in sonography, it's used to study heartbeats & blood flow. in echocardiography, it's used to study heartbeats.
