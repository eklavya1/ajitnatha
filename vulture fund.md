It is an investment fund that seeks out and buys securities in distressed investments, such as high-yield bonds in or near default, or equities that are in or near bankruptcy. The goal is to 'swoop in' and pick up underpriced shares that are perceived to have been oversold to make high-risk but potentially high-reward bets.
The pandemic provides a unique opportunity for vulture funds to expand their business by acquiring distressed companies to penetrate the market further, and an attractive investment opportunity to leverage the lower valuation of distressed assets.
This situation may provide the much-needed impetus to the current business opportunities in India and worldwide and, in so doing, bring a certain degree of respite from the misfortunes of COVID-19.
