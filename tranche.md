in structured finance, a tranche is one of a number of related securities offered as part of the same transaction. in the financial sense of the word, each bond is a different slice of the deal's risk.  transaction documentation (see indenture) usually defines the tranches as different "classes" of notes, each identified by letter (e.g., the class a, class b, class c securities) with different bond credit ratings.

the term tranche is used in fields of finance other than structured finance (such as in straight lending, where multi-tranche loans are commonplace), but the term's use in structured finance may be singled out as particularly important. use of "tranche" as a verb is limited almost exclusively to this field.

the word tranche means a division or portion of a pool or whole  and is derived from the french for 'slice', 'section', 'series', or 'portion', and is also a cognate of the english 'trench' ('ditch').
