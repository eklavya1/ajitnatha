	- `we are not sure about this effect, research ongoing`
	- aka `southern osciallation` #pre 
	- [[etymology]] - `christ child` "the blessed child" because it begins just before the [[Christmas]]
	- ==off notes==
	- once in 7 or 8 yrs in [[nov]]-[[dec]] the [[ITCZ]] moves too much to the south of [[equator]] resulting in weakening of [[trade 风]] & the subsequent reduction of [[upwelling]] along the [[south 美国]] coast
	- this causes the warming of surface waters of south & central america, is called as El Niño 05:22 AM 14/8/2021
	- the appearance of El Niño causes air pressure to drop over eastern pacific coast & rise over western pacific
	- this see-saw variation of [[air]] [[pressure]] is called as `El Niño southern osciallation`
	- this causes heavy precipitation along eastern pacific & [[draught]] conditions along western pacific
	- after 1 or 2 years, the enhanced headley circulation { [[headley cell]] } strengthens the [[trade 风]] & increases [[upwelling]] bringing back the normal conditions
# effect of El Niño
- El Niño causes global climatic imbalances
- it results in [[draught]]s in [[india]] & [[australia]]
- heavy [[precipitation]] along coastal [[desert]]s of [[peru]] & [[chile]]
- warm water inhibits the growth of [[algae]] & suppresses [[upwelling]][[la nina]]
- devastating marine ecosystems killing fish along [[peru]], chile coast
		- the decomposition of fish releases `hydrogen sulphide` causing dark waters & making it toxic _related_ [[hydrogen]] | [[sulphur]] | [[Sulphate]] 
- during el nino high pressure near to [[india]], [[australia]] & [[caribbean sea]] suppresses cyclone formation 02:08 PM 14/8/2021

# question
- Most of the unusual climatic happenings are explained outcome of the El-Nino effect. Do you agree?
