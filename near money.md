-   **Near money is an economic term describing non-cash assets that can be easily converted into cash but are not used as a medium of exchange in everyday transactions.** For example, 
-   the time deposits, 
-   Bills of Exchanges,
-   **Government and Private Bonds**,
-   Saving certificates, 
-   **shares** etc. possess the power of money, yet they are not used to perform immediate economic activities.
-   Currency notes and demand deposits such as cheques, demand drafts etc. are more liquid than near money and can be used as medium of exchange in everyday transactions. Thus they are not categorized as near money.
-   **Real estate can not be called near money.** The holder of the real estate needs to convert it into money before performing economic activities.
