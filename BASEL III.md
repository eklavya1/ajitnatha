basel ill norms required same minimum CAR as CAR II norms (8% of risk-weighted assets).
within this car, CAR III required more of common equity tier i capital, best quality capital with banks.
in addition, banks are required to maintainminimum CCB raised through their own resources like cutting down on dividend and bonus payments.
minimum LR or TIER I capital asproportion of total assets of 3% is also to be maintained under BASEL III.

## what
basel norms or basel accords are international banking regulations issued by basel committee on banking supervision.
basel norms is effort to coordinate banking regulations across globe, with goal of strengthening international banking system.
it's set of agreement by basel committee of banking supervision which focuses on risks to banks and financial system.

## basel 3
in [[2010]], basel ill guidelines were released.
these guidelines were introduced in response to financial crisis of [[2008]].
need was felt to further strengthen system as banks in developed economies were under-capitalized, over-leveraged and hadgreater reliance on short-term funding.
it was also felt that quantity and quality of capital under basel 11 were deemed insufficient to contain any further risk.
guidelines aim to promotemore resilient banking system by focusing on 4 vital banking parameters viz. capital, leverage, funding and liquidity.
capital: capital adequacy ratio is to be maintained at 12.9%.
o minimum tier 1 capital ratio and minimum tier 2 capital ratio have to be maintained at 10.5% and 2% of risk-weighted assets respectively.
o in addition, banks have to maintaincapital conservation buffer of 2.5%.
counter-cyclical buffer is also to be maintained at 0-2.5%.
leverage: leverage rate has to be at least 3 %.
leverage rate is ratio ofbank's tier-i capital to average total consolidated assets.
funding and liquidity: basel-ill created 2 liquidity ratios: lcr and nsfr.
liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) will require banks to holdbuffer of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to deal with cash outflows encountered in acute short term stress scenario as specified by supervisors.
o this is to prevent situations like "bank run".
o goal is to ensure that banks have enough liquidity for30-days stress scenario if it were to happen.
o net stable funds rate (nsfr) requires banks to maintainstable funding profile in relation to their off-balance-sheet assets and activities.
nsfr requires banks to fund their activities with stable sources of finance (reliable over one-year horizon).
o minimum nsfr requirement is 100%.
o therefore, lcr measures short-term (30 days) resilience and nsfr measures medium-term (1 year) resilience.

它是一个 global, voluntary regulatory framework on bank capital adequacy, stress testing 和  market liquidity risk
