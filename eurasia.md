eurasia () is the largest continental area on earth, comprising all of [[europe]] & [[asia]]. primarily in the northern & eastern hemispheres, it spans from the british isles & the [[iberian peninsula]] in the west to the japanese archipelago & the russian   far east in the east. the continental landmass is bordered by the atlantic ocean & africa to the west, the pacific ocean to the east, the arctic ocean to the north, & by africa, the mediterranean sea, & the indian ocean to the south. the division between europe & asia as two continents is a historical social construct, as many of their borders are over land; thus, in some parts of the world, eurasia is recognized as the largest of the six, five, or four continents on earth. in geology, eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. however, the rigidity of eurasia is debated based on paleomagnetic data.eurasia covers around 55,000,000 square kilometres (21,000,000 sq mi), or around 36.2% of the earth's total land area; & is home to the largest country in the world, russia. the landmass contains well over 5 billion people, equating to approximately 70% of the human population. humans first settled in eurasia between 60,000 & 125,000 years ago. some major islands, including great britain, iceland, ireland, & sri lanka, as well as those of japan, the philippines, & most of indonesia, are often included in the popular definition of eurasia, despite being separate from the contiguous landmass.

according to some geographers physiographically, eurasia is a single continent. the concepts of europe & asia as distinct continents date back to antiquity, & their borders are geologically arbitrary & have historically been subjected to occasional change. eurasia is connected to africa at the suez canal, & eurasia is sometimes combined with africa to make the largest contiguous landmass on earth called afro-eurasia. due to the vast landmass & differences in latitude, eurasia exhibits all types of climate under the k√∂ppen classification, including the harshest types of hot & cold temperatures, high & low precipitation & various types of ecosystems.
