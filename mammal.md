## Significance of studying mammalian lactation
It shows us how evolution has resulted in remarkably fine-tuned solutions to problems.
Study about antimicrobial protein - For instance, the duck-billed platypus, a mammal that lays eggs has evolved a milk pad but not teats.
As a result, its newborn sucklings are exposed to a large load and variety of microbes.
An unusually potent antimicrobial protein, MLP (Monotreme Lactation Protein) found only in platypus milk serves to protect its babies from pathogens.
Promote business - Studying mammalian lactation can aid to build sustainable businesses in the vegan milk sector.
Amongst the most ambitious approaches are the ones trying to grow cell cultures of the mammary organs themselves to secrete human and other mammalian milk.
Several start-ups are attempting to make "animal-free" value-added dairy products and at least one start-up is trying to re-constitute human breast milk with critical proteins made through synthetic biology.i shariat
Understanding the proteins - It helps scientists understand how lactoferrin, a whey protein, modulates in multiple ways thus promoting a beneficial gut microbiome among infants.
Recently whey proteins have been produced using synthetic biology techniques by relying on re-programming a type of fungus called Trichoderma.
The Vechur cow (now almost extinct), a dwarf cow, native to the Kuttanad region of Kerala yields milk containing as much lactoferrin as human breast milk.
