Wetlands are ecosystems saturated with water, either seasonally or permanently.
They include mangroves, marshes, rivers, lakes, deltas, floodplains, and flooded forests, rice fields, coral reefs, marine areas no deeper than 6 meters at low tide, as well as human-made wetlands such as waste-water treatment ponds and reservoirs.
Though they cover only around 6% of the Earth's land surface, 40% of all plant and animal species live or breed in wetlands.
The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other landforms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil.
Recently, the Ramsar Convention has designated four new wetlands in India, as wetlands of global importance.
1. Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary, the largest wetland in Haryana is a human-made freshwater wetland.
2. Sultanpur National Park from Haryana supports more than 220 species of resident, winter migratory and local migratory waterbirds at critical stages of their life cycles.
3. Thol Lake Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat lies on the Central Asian Flyway and more than 320 bird species can be found here.
4. Wadhwana Wetland from Gujarat is internationally important for its birdlife as it provides wintering ground to migratory waterbirds, including over 80 species that migrate on the Central Asian Flyvvay.
These wetlands are home to endangered bird species like Egyptian Vulture, Saker Falcon, Sociable Lapwing, and the near-threatened Dalmatian Pelican. With this, the number of Ramsar sites in India is 46.


## Potential benefits of coastal marshes and wetlands
- Wetland types found in coastal watersheds include salt marshes, bottomland hardwood swamps, fresh marshes, mangrove swamps, etc.
- Flood Protection: Coastal wetlands protect upland areas, including valuable residential and commercial property, from flooding due to sea-level rise and storms.
- Coastal wetlands provide habitat for many federally threatened and endangered species, They act as a habitat for migratory birds and animals.
- Coastal Wetlands can improve water quality by removing pollutants from surface waters.
- Three pollutant removal processes provided by wetlands are particularly important: sediment trapping, nutrient removal, and chemical detoxification.
- Recharges a drinking water source, such as a wellhead or source protection area. Reduces levels of contaminants in surface waters that recharge underlying or adjacent groundwaters such as wells.
- Enhances or protects water quality through chemical action, by the removal of nutrients, by the retention or removal of sediments or organic matter, or by moderating the adverse water quality effects of soil erosion or stormwater runoff.
