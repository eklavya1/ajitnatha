Economics ( PG ) Class 09

Indian Industry at 1947(Dictation of last class)(1:01:00PM)

At the time of independence, the industrial structure was backward in nature. Some of its features were:
1. Dominance of consumer goods industry and absence of capital goods industry.
2. Skewed industrial sector with respect to the size of industries- 30% of the workers were employed in small industries(employing 6 to 9 workers), 42% of the workers were employed in very large industries (employing more than 500 workers).
3. Very high capital intensity of industry at the time of independence, two factors were responsible for this- shortage of skilled workforce(both technical and managerial skills)  and availability of cheap capital due to the deliberate policy of a low-interest rate by the British.

Industrial conference of December 1947(1:10:00pm)

It discussed the need to provide certain tax concessions to the industries.
Also, finance can come from- Capital markets or Banks. However, as there were low savings with the people banks didn't have enough capital. Also,  sthe capital market was not well developed at that time.
Thus government came up with the concept of  Developmental Financial Institution.
The first DFI set up by the government was Industrial Financial Corporation.
The next question discussed was what type of industries should be set up.
Industrial Policy Resolution, 1948:
IPR 1948 introduced a form of institutional network for the development of the industry which is called the mixed economy model.
The government was allowed to take an active role in the industrialisation of the country. The private sector was allowed but under the regulation and direction of the government.
The policy introduced a threat of nationalisation whereby the existing industries in the private sector were subject to a takeover by the government after a performance review.
Refer PPT.

Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956(1:30:00pm)

IPR, 1956 provided a dominant role to the State in speeding industrialisation. Apart from developing heavy industries and machine making industries, the policy recognised the importance of small scale industries.
Various support mechanisms such as tax breaks, reservation of products, etc were to be provided to the small scale industries.
The policy emphasised securing and balancing coordinated development of industries in each region of the country.
The policy was to be implemented through a system of licensing and controls that was institutionalised by the Industries Development and Regulation Act, 1951, The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act of 1969 and Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Further, the government passed a range of control orders like import and export controls, control of capital issues, price control, transport control, etc.
Objectives of the licensing system:
1. The system was instituted to direct investments towards certain important sections and certain classes of goods.
2. To correlate the supply and demand of goods in the domestic market.
3. To control the competition in the economy and protect the consumers from exploitative practices.
4. To ensure optimum utilisation of capital.

Industries (Development and Regulation Act, 1951)(1:55:00PM)

Undertakings of all those industries, which were included in the schedule of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, were required to be
registered whether they come under the private sector or the public sector.
If the working of a particular industrial unit was not satisfactory (say, for example, there was substantial underutilization of capacity or product was not up to the mark or cost of production and price were excessive), the government could set up an enquiry into the affairs of the particular undertaking;

Industrial Development(1951 to 1991)(2:00:00PM)

Positive Changes:
1. The share of industries increased from 16.6% of GDP in 1950 to 27.7% of GDP in 1991. This is a sign of structural improvement as the share of agriculture declined from 54% to 29% in the same time period.
2. Increase in the share of capital goods industry from less than 25% in 1950 to more than 40% by 1991. (of total industrial production)
3. Increase in infrastructure development at a very fast pace. For example: In power sector: 2300 MW(1950-51) to 1,04,000 MW(1991). High growth in metal industry- Steel 1 MT(1950) to 6 MT(1991), etc.
4. Increase in share of public share in total investment(from less than 40% in 1951 to more than 65% in 1966 and finally settled at 55% in 1985). The public sector took the role of the commanding heights of the economy.
5. Larger industrial diversification- Compared to only 6 industrial commodities, in 1951 to more than 1000 plus in 1991.
Problems:
1. Poor performance of the Public Sector enterprises. The PSUs suffered losses even in sectors that were not welfare-oriented. The poor target achievement by the PSUs led to the shortage of industrial inputs which created huge scarcities in the economy.
2. Poor infrastructure - the quality of infrastructure created was substandard. Though the quantity of infrastructure creation was good, it was not enough to maintain the pace with industrial and civic requirements.
3. There was a constant underutilization of capacity because of the poor policy structure of the government(license-quota-permit Raj) and poor quality of the infrastructure.
4. The already industrialised states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu captured most of the industrial investments. States like Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh did not get any industrial investments. Though the government announced certain projects in these states, the ecosystem for industrialisation was never developed.
5. The industrial structure remained skewed resulting in the missing middle. This led to slow growth of entrepreneurship and poor development of employment opportunities.
6. There was a huge industrial sickness as loss-making enterprises were not allowed to exit the market(the restrictive exit policy such as the Industrial Dispute Act). These loss-making companies wasted a lot of resources and added to the production cost.

Public Sector Enterprises/Undertakings(3:05:00PM)

Business units owned, managed and controlled by the government with a view to maximise social welfare and uphold public interest are known as Public sector enterprises or public sector undertakings.
Features:
1. Government ownership and management.
2. They are financed by the government. 
3. They are not guided by the profit motive alone as the major focus is to maximise social welfare.
4. As they are run by government policies, they are held accountable to the Parliament.
Types of PSUs:
1. Departmental Undertakings: They function under the overall control of the ministry. The finances and management are controlled in the same way as in any other government department. They are primarily used for the provision of essential services such as railways, postal services, etc. 
2. Statutory corporation: It refers to such organisations created by the Parliament or the State legislature by an Act which defines its powers, functions, management pattern, rules and regulation for its employees and its relationship with the government departments. Example: LIC, FCI, etc
3. Government companies: It refers to those companies in which 50% or more paid-up capital is held by the government and is registered under the Companies Act. It is fully governed by the provisions of the Companies Act.
Potential Role of PSUs:
1. Promoting investment by directing it for correct usage and by earning profits and reinvesting them. 
2. To generate employment and also provide on the job training. The PSUs assume the role of a model employer and have a moderating influence on the employment and wage policies of the private sector.
3. Price control by ensuring regular supplies of goods and also producing them at affordable rates.
4. Provide balanced regional growth. PSUs can open up units in areas where otherwise the private players may not invest.
5. Industrial diversification and provision of essential goods and services. If the marked is accorded primacy, there could be relative underinvestment in sectors important for the majority of the population.
6, To promote technological development as the scale of investment in research and development is beyond the capacity of individual investors. 
Contribution of PSUs in industrial development:
1. Contribution to capital formation- Public investment in industries increased from less than 20% of total industrial investment to more than 65% by 1996 and remained upwards of 50% till 1991. Most of the capacity building in the heavy industries has been done by the public sector.
2. Expansive development of infrastructure. Example: Electrification - Generation (NTPC), Transmission(PowerGrid) and Distribution(State Discoms). Roads by NHAI, etc.
3. Diversified industrial phase- PSUs in consumer goods(HMT watches, ScootersIndia, Modern Breads), Basic goods(Coal India, IOCL, ONGC), Capital goods(Bharat Heavy Electricals).
4. Reducing inequality by preventing the concentration of resources in the hands of a few private players and providing good wages to workers, especially at a lower grade.
5. It has prevented the creation of natural monopolies in essential utility sectors such as railways, power sector etc. 
(A natural monopoly is defined as a situation where one firm is sufficient to meet all demand requirements and the technology is such that average cost falls over a very long range of output. For example, Railways).
PSUs have contributed to savings and have enhanced foreign exchange by import substitution of both capital goods and intermediate goods and also exporting goods and services.
