## **launched by UNDP & OPHI** in [[2010]].
according to global mpi 2021, indian standard is 66 out of 109 countries.
national mpl aims to eliminate global mpl & create a global-oriented mpl for india to design broad-based transformation programs with ultimate goal of improving [[india]]'s position at global mpl levels.
global multidimensional poverty index [[2021]] was released by united nations development programme (undp) & oxford poverty & human development initiative (ophi).
mpl is based on idea that [[poverty]] is not unidimensional (not just depends on income & one individual may lack several basic needs like [[education]], [[health]] etc.), rather it is multidimensional.
index shows proportion of poor people & average number of deprivations each poor person experiences at same time.
mpl uses three dimensions & ten indicators which are:
	• education: years of schooling & child enrollment (1/6 weightage each, total 2/6);
	• health: child mortality & nutrition (1/6 weightage each, total 2/6);
	• standard of living: [[electricity]], flooring, drinking [[water]], sanitation, cooking fuel & assets (1/18 weightage each, total 2/6).
a person is multidimensionally poor if she/he is deprived in one third or more (means 33% or more) of weighted indicators (out of ten indicators).
those who are deprived in one half or more of weighted indicators are considered living in extreme multidimensional poverty.
mpl is significant as it recognizes poverty from different dimensions compared to conventional methodology that measures poverty only from income or monetary terms.
