the kármán line (or von kármán line ) is an attempt to define a boundary between earth's atmosphere and outer space, and offers a specific definition set by the fédération aéronautique internationale (fai), an international record-keeping body for aeronautics. defining the edge of space is important for legal and regulatory purposes since aircraft and spacecraft fall under different jurisdictions and are subject to different treaties. international law does not define the edge of space, or the limit of national airspace.the fai defines the kármán line as space beginning 100 kilometres (54 nautical miles; 62 miles; 330,000 feet) above earth's mean sea level. while experts disagree on exactly where the atmosphere ends and space begins, most regulatory agencies (including the united nations) accept the fai kármán line definition or something close to it. as defined by the fai, the kármán line was established in the 1960s. various countries and entities define space's boundary differently for various purposes.the kármán line is named after theodore von kármán (1881–1963), a hungarian american engineer and physicist who was active in aeronautics and astronautics. in 1957, he was the first person to attempt to derive such an altitude limit.
