- khyber pakhtunkhwa (hindko and urdu: خیبر پختونخوا, ; pashto: خیبر پښتونخوا), often abbreviated as kpk or kp, is a province of [[pakistan]]. it is located in the northwestern region of the country, along the [[afghanistan]]–pakistan border and close to [[tajikistan]] border.

it was previously known as the north-west frontier province (nwfp) until 2010, when its name was changed to khyber pakhtunkhwa by the 18th amendment to the constitution of pakistan, and is known colloquially by various other names. khyber pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest pakistani province in terms of both its population and its economy, though it is geographically the smallest of pakistan's four provinces. within pakistan, khyber pakhtunkhwa shares a border with the islamabad capital territory, punjab, balochistan, and the pakistani-administered territories of gilgit–baltistan and azad jammu and kashmir. it is home to 17.9 per cent of pakistan's total population, with the majority of the province's inhabitants being ethnic pashtuns and hindko-speakers.

the province is the site of the ancient region of gandhara, including the ruins of its capital, pushkalavati, located near modern-day charsadda. once a stronghold of buddhism, the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions by various empires due to its geographical proximity to the khyber pass.on 2 march 2017, the government of pakistan considered a proposal to merge the adjoining federally administered tribal areas (fata) with khyber pakhtunkhwa, and to repeal the frontier crimes regulation, a set of british raj-era special laws that was inherited by pakistan to govern the tribal areas following the partition of india in 1947. however, some political parties opposed the merger, and called for the tribal areas to instead become a separate province entirely. on 24 may 2018, the national assembly of pakistan voted in favour of an amendment to merge the federally administered tribal areas and provincially administered tribal areas (pata) with khyber pakhtunkhwa. the provincial assembly of khyber pakhtunkhwa subsequently approved the bill on 28 may 2018, which would merge fata and pata with the province of khyber pakhtunkhwa. it was signed in on 31 may by the erstwhile president of pakistan, mamnoon hussain, officially completing the process of the historic administrative merger.
