Bru or Reang is a community indigenous to Northeast India, living mostly in Tripura, Mizoram and Assam.
In Tripura, they are recognised as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group.
In Mizoram, they have been targeted by groups that do not consider them indigenous to the state.
In 1997, following ethnic clashes, nearly 37,000 Brus fled the Mamit, Kolasib and Lunglei districts of Mizoram and were accommodated in relief camps in Tripura.
In June 2018, community leaders from the Bru camps signed an agreement with the Centre and the two-state governments, providing for repatriation in Mizoram.
