Economics ( PG ) Class 08

A brief overview of previous class

Doubt resolution

Public distribution system(PDS) (1:18:00 PM):

The PDS was introduced around World War II as a wartime rationing measure for the management of scarcity and distribution of food grains at affordable prices.
After independence, it was continued as a deliberate social policy with the objective of :
1. Maintaining price stability.
2. Rationing during the situation of scarcity.
3. Providing food grains and other essential items to the vulnerable sections of society at reasonable prices.
4. To keep a check on the private trade of food grains
5. To attempt socialization in the matter of distribution of essential commodities(now there will be no discrimination on the basis of caste, class, etc).
The central government is responsible for procurement, storage, transportation, and bulk allocation to the states.
The State governments have operational responsibilities including allocation within the States, issuing of ration cards, supervision, and monitoring of fair price shops.
Revamped PDS:
It was launched in 1992 in 1775 blocks throughout the country. The area-specific programs such as the drought-prone area program, the desert area program, integrated tribal development program, and designated hill areas were identified in consultation with State governments for special focus to improve the PDS system.
Under this scheme, the foodgrains were allocated to States for Revamped PDS blocks at lower prices as compared to normal PDS blocks
Targeted PDS:
In 1997, following the advice of the World Bank, the government of India introduced Targeted PDS in order to curtail the food subsidy. 
The "targeted" here means the focus is on the poor and vulnerable sections of society. Therefore, PDS transformed from a general and a universal system to a system with a targeted food subsidy to below poverty line households.
Features:
The households were divided into two categories- the Above Poverty Line and Below Poverty Line. In addition to this, a category of Antyodaya households(poorest of the poor) was introduced in 2000.
TDPS had a two-tiered pricing structure- one for the BPL households and the other for the APL households. The size of the BPL population and the entitlements for the BPL population were to be decided by the central government. (through consumption expenditure surveys which are used for poverty estimation)
The responsibility of the state government was the identification of the BPL families. (through BPL survey conducted by each State, now replaced by the Socio-economic caste census).
The end retail price was to be fixed by the State governments taking into consideration the margin for the fair price shop owners, transportation charges, etc.
Issues under TPDS:
There are various issues faced in the identification of the below poverty line(BPL) households. A large number of poor and needy people are left out(exclusion error) and a lot of bogus cards are issued(inclusion errors).
Illegal diversion of PDS commodities to the open market through a highly institutionalized network of traders and middlemen.
Issues related to access of grains. These include extra charges being levied, issues relating to the timing of delivery, less quantity given, caste, and gender discrimination.
The grain available at the PDS outlet is often of low quality. A significant portion of the grains held in storage for a long period gets spoiled.
Due to the above issues, the targeted PDS has benefited the poor only marginally as most of the food purchases come from the open market.
In light of the above came the NFSA, 2013.

National Food Security Act, 2013 (2:57:00 PM)

Explained through PPT.
The most important provision of NFSA is that it makes the ‘right to food’ a legal entitlement.
NFSA extends the coverage of TPDS to 75 percent of the rural population and 50 percent of the urban population.
NFSA also simplifies the different categories of beneficiaries from three in the pre-NFSA TPDS to two by replacing the Above Poverty Line (APL) and BPL categories with a single ‘priority’ category and retaining the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY). This is important as one of the major criticisms of the pre-NFSA TPDS was the high diversion of foodgrains in the APL category.
Every person belonging to a priority household is entitled to receive five kg of rice per person per month from TPDS. However, NFSA retains the pre-NFSA entitlements for the AAY households that will continue to receive 35 kg of food grain per household.
All eligible households shall be entitled to food grains at subsidized prices not exceeding INR 3, 2, and 1 for rice, wheat, and coarse grains, respectively, for the first three years since the commencement of the Act. However, this was never revised.
State governments are required to identify households to be covered under AAY and priority categories within a year from the commencement of NFSA and place the list of identified eligible households in the public domain.
State-wise coverage will be determined by the Central Government. State-wise coverage has been determined by the Planning Commission on the basis of 2011-12 NSSO Household Consumption Expenditure Survey data.
NFSA follows the lifecycle approach. NFSA makes it the Central Government’s responsibility to provide a free meal through local Anganwadis (childcare centers) and a maternity benefit of at least INR 6000 for pregnant and lactating (until six months after childbirth) mothers It includes provisions for food entitlements for children aged six months to 14 years. Section 5 entitles all children aged 6 months to 6 years to a free meal at the Anganwadis and a free mid-day meal for all school-going children up to class VIII (or age 14). 
NFSA entitles all eligible persons to a food security allowance in case they are not provided the entitled quantities of foodgrains or meals. This payment has to be made by the state government to each person.
State Governments appoint District Grievance Redress Officers (DGROs) and constitute a State Food Commission (SFC) for the purpose of monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the Act.
Reforms of TPDS: Section 12 of NFSA makes it the responsibility of Central and State Governments to “progressively undertake necessary reforms of the TPDS” such as:
1. doorstep delivery of foodgrains to FPSs
2. application of information and communication technologies with the aim of end-to-end computerization of TPDS
3. transparency of records
4. shifting management of FPSs from private owners to public bodies such as women’s cooperatives
5. diversification of commodities distributed
6. leveraging Aadhaar for identification of beneficiaries
7. introducing programs such as cash transfers and food coupons
Food coupons:
The consumer is given food coupons by the local authority. They can redeem it at the Fair Price Shops.
The FP shops have to collect these food coupons and their next allotment will depend on this. Hence, diversion will be cut. However, there is the issue of fake food coupons.
The identification problem is still not solved here as the coupon still needs to be sent to the identified beneficiaries.
A possible solution is to issue coupons that can be redeemed in the open market or Fair Price shops.

Industries (3:38:00 PM)

A brief overview of the chapter
State of Indian Industry at independence:
During British, we imported the finished products and exported raw materials.
After WW 2, owing to the needs of the British, some forms of industry were pushed like Iron and Steel, cement, and chemicals.
Further small-scale industries were present like cotton, jute, and sugar for meeting the local demands. But due to partition, the crop growing regions of cotton and jute went to West Pakistan and East Pakistan respectively.
Basic goods- For example, iron, cement, etc.
Capital goods- They are heavy machine-making goods that are used for further production and are not consumed in the process.
Consumer goods- This is further classified into durables(like appliances) and non-durables (like food items).
Issues in India:
The major disadvantage in India was that the capital goods industries were missing.
The problem of ownership: Very few large players along with a large number of small industries were present. This is known as the problem of missing middle in Indian industry which is a problem even today. 
The industrial structure was capital intensive and not labor-intensive. This was due to a lack of skilled labor. British gave cheap finance as they wanted the industries to produce more after the war turmoil and thus the industry remained capital intensive.
