international relations class 15

a brief overview 

bimstec(1:37:00pm)
bimstec(1:37:00pm)

bimstec stands for bay of bengal initiative for multi-sectoral technical & economic cooperation,
it was founded in 1997 & was known by bist-ec(bangladesh, india, sri lanka, thailand) then. it was initiative taken by india & thailand.
towards end of 1997, myanmar joined & now name became bimst-ec.
in 2004, nepal & bhutan joined & full form of bimstec was changed to present one.
it ties geography of bay of bengal with himalayas.
profile of bimstec:
it represents 21% of world's population & 2.7 trillion dollars of gdp.
secretariat is located in dhaka, bangladesh.
importance of bimstec:
strategic importance:
it's vital in fulfilling india's foreign policy objective namely: neighbourhood 1st policy & act east policy.
it acts as a bridge b/w south & south-east asia.
important role in development of india's north eastern region.
to counter assertive china.
economic importance:
this grouping comprises emerging economies that grew at average growth of 6.5% foll global financial meltdown. thus, this is economically significant grouping.
bay of bengal is rich in untapped natural resources such as oil & gas, seabed minerals & fishing stock.
regional connectivity:
it seeks to connect indian coastal states as well as north eastern region to south-east asia. therefore it will lead to development of coastal region & north eastern region.
some exs: india-myanmar-thailand trilateral highway, kaladan multimodal cargo transport project(it includes port, river & road, it seeks to connect kolkata port to sittwe port(in rakhine state) in myanmar & then through kaladan river it will connect with north-eastern states of india).
challenges facing bimstec:
infrequent summits- till 2018, 20 years since its establishment only 4 leaders' summits have taken place. this is despite fact that bimstec planned to hold such summits every 2 years & ministerial meetings every year.
lack of leadership- india's push towards bimstec comes only when saarc ostensibly fails to fulfil economic growth agenda while thailand has been caught up in political volatility while prioritising asean over bimstec. 
no free trade agreement- bimstec fta was negotiated in 2004 but remains in abeyance.
member countries are caught up in domestic issues- for ex, myanmar has ethnic crisis & recent military coup; thailand also has political volatility.
bilateral issues b/w member countries- border conflict b/w myanmar & thailand; bangladesh facing rohingya refugee crisis  b/c of their religious persecution in myanmar.
efforts at expanding scope of grouping by conducting first-ever military exercise in 2018 saw non-participation by 2 countries- nepal & thailand.
groupings like bcim(bangladesh, china, india & myanmar) with a vibrant membership of china creates further doubts over relevance of bimstec. most member countries are in active economic cooperation with china over their bri initiative, checking their incentives for economic cooperation amongst themselves as a part of bri.
achievements of bimstec:
establishment of bimstec grid interconnectivity(an agreement has been signed).
mutual agreement on customs matters.
2021 ministerial meeting c/a for early adoption of bimstec charter.
q- has bimstec emerged as alternative to saarc. discuss.
bimstec as alternative to saarc:
in 2018, at bimstec summit, pm modi announced: "it's a natural platform to fulfil our key foreign policy priorities of neighbourhood 1st & act east policy".
bimstec leaders were invited to swearing-in ceremony of 2nd term of modi govt.
india invited bimstec leaders to brics outreach summit.
reasons:
stagnancy of saarc: india pakistan rivalry bringing saarc to complete standstill.
importance of bimstec with respect to strategic, economic & connectivity perspectives(discussed above).
does it mean that saarc has lost its relevance;
saarc is organisation with regional identity- a pan south asian nations' organisation while bimstec is inter-regional organisation(2+5 grouping).
other such regional organisations, be it eu or asean have achieved several important milestones in regional economic integration. given that saarc is still at a nascent stage, it's expected to achieve regional welfare agenda in future.
current stagnancy of saarc can not be concluded as its death or complete loss of relevance.
bimstec is also not a full-proof organisation & it also has its challenges. for ex, many members are actively engaging with china.
conclusion:
founding principle of bimstec states that cooperation among member countries of bimstec will be in addition to & not a substitute of other bilateral as well as regional cooperations.

mekong ganga cooperation(2:41:00pm)
mekong ganga cooperation(2:41:00pm)

aim: it aims to promote closer cooperation among people inhabiting 2 civilisation rivers - mekong & ganga.
member countries: this organisation was again established by leadership of india & thailand, to take care of ldcs(least developed countries) like clmv(cambodia, laos, myanmar, & vietnam.). presently they are not ldcs. therefore, total 6 members: india, thailand, cambodia, laos, myanmar, & vietnam.

india & south east asia(3:01:00pm):
india & south east asia(3:01:00pm):

doubt resolution
phases of india's relation with south east asia:
1. civilisational ties:
jawaharlal nehru in discovery of india referred to this region as "greater india". given spread of religion, language(particularly sanskrit), social customs(reverence to brahmins), epic narrative(ramayana) & styles of art, architecture, dance & music along with spread of trade.
however, this romanticism foundered & relations remained sparse foll their independence.
2. during cold war
lack of vibrant interactions as:
a. cold war politics- india was a founder of nam titled towards ussr while south-east asian countries were in usa camp.
b. india was inward-looking economy while south-east asian countries were just as backward & conflict-ridden as indian subcontinent.
c. india's overland linkages to south east asia blocked by post-colonial politics due to hostile east pakistan(bangladesh) & junta govt in myanmar.
3. end of cold war & launch of look east policy(lep)
lep was launched by pv narsimha rao in 1991.
determinants of india's look east policy:
a. disintegration of ussr.
b. india to improve relations with then single superpower,usa-india sought to enhance strategic cooperation with usa indirectly by enhancing cooperation with southeast asian countries. (looking east to look west)
c. launch of new economic policy, 1991- search of new export markets.
d. failure of saarc to fulfil india's economic agenda through regional integration.
e. rise of china- growing economic & military might of china cast a shadow over region which had traditionally been wary of beijing. india's interests in engaging more deeply, therefore, offered nations of south east asia prospect of a democratic & non-threatening counterbalance. india's outreach was also supported by usa against china in region
f. helped by shared colonial experience, cultural affinities going back to antiquity & despite estrangement of cold war years, a striking lack of historical resentments b/w them.
g. it provided india with opportunity to establish itself as a regional player & not be dismissed as a subcontinental power at best.
