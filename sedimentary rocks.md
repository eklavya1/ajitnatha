formed at [[earth]]'s surface by d hydrological system
formation of sedimentary rocks involved d weathering of preexisting rocks
contains [[fossil]]s
typically occur in layers

- sedimentary rocks weather faster than [[igneous 石]]
- Sedimentary rocks are made up of layers or strata of mineral particles found in other rocks that 有 weathered.
- 这 是 formed 被 د solidification 的 sediments 的 original igneous 或 metamorphic 石.
- Their origin involves د weathering of pre-existing rocks, transportation of د material away من د original site, deposition of د eroded material in د sea or in some other sedimentary environment, followed by compaction and cementation.
- Sedimentary rocks are formed on د Earth's surface by د hydrologic system.
- one sedimentary 石 能 也 lead to د formation 的 another 石
# Stages 里 د form. 的 sedimentary 石
- #pneumonic WTDLC `what Dlc ?` (while plaing games on PS4!!)
1. weathering : in-situ breakdown 的 original 石
2. transportation : 的 sediments
3. deposition : 的 sediments 里 basin
4. lithification : conversion 的 loose sediments into hard 石
	1. compaction : 哪 د sediments 是 squeezed by د weight 的 overlying layers
	2. lithification 是 any process 那 turn raw rock sediment into consolidated sedimentary rock
5. cementation : it involves binding 一起 的 compacted sedimetns by 自然 (natural) cementing materials.
- sediment rocks 是 formed 里 different layers/strata
- they 有 大 quantity 的 fossils
- 比如 -
			1. sandstone
			2. limestone 
			3. clay
			4. chalk
			5. coal
			6. gypsum
