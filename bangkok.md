Bangkok, officially known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon & colloquially as Krung Thep, is capital & most populous city of Thailand. city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7 sq mi) in Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand & has an estimated [[population]] of 10.539 million as of 2020, 15.3 percent of country's population. Over 14 million people (22.2 percent) lived within surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at 2010 census, making Bangkok an extreme primate city, dwarfing [[Thailand]]'s other urban centres in both size & importance to national [[economy]].

Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during Ayutthaya Kingdom in 15th century, which eventually grew & became site of two capital cities, Thonburi in 1768 & Rattanakosin in 1782. Bangkok was at heart of modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during late-19th century, as country faced pressures from West. city was at centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout 20th century, as country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, & underwent numerous coups & several uprisings. city, incorporated as a special administrative area under Bangkok Metropolitan Administration in 1972, grew rapidly during 1960s through 1980s & now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media & modern society.

The Asian investment boom in 1980s & 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. city is now a regional force in finance & business. It is an international hub for transport & health care, & has emerged as a centre for arts, fashion, & entertainment. city is known for its street life & cultural landmarks, as well as its red-light districts. Grand Palace & Buddhist temples including Wat Arun & Wat Pho stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as nightlife scenes of Khaosan Road & Patpong. Bangkok is among world's top tourist destinations, & has been named world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.

Bangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape & inadequate infrastructure. Despite an extensive expressway network, an inadequate road network & substantial private car usage have led to chronic & crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in 1990s. city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve problem, operating eight urban rail lines & building other public transit, but congestion still remains a prevalent issue. city faces long-term environmental threats such as sea level rise due to climate change.
