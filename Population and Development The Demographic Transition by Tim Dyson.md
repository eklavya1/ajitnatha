Crucially, as societies go through the trans ition they inv ariably experience several major demographic processes in roughly the following order: mortality decline, population growth, fertility decline, urbanization, population ageing. — location: [75]()

the demographic transition on general societal development have been, and are, both broad and profound. Taken together, the transition’s processes lead to a complete transformation in the nature of human society. For example, mortality decline means that people can think about the [[future]] with much greater confidence. Death becomes a relatively rare and distant event. The circumstances in which people live become increasingly stable, and in these new conditions it makes increasing sense to save and invest. The acquirement of formal education becomes increasingly important. The transition also brings about major changes in family institutions. It operates to make marriage both 5 a more flexible and a weaker institution. Fertility decline allows women to lead lives that are much less constrained by household affairs – lives that gradually become more like those experienced by men. The concentration of people in towns which arises from the demographic transition produces societies that are unprecedentedly varied, complex and mobile. The division of labour increases, and so does the extent of competitiveness. — location: [244]()

Lastly, a word is required about the transition’s consequences for the global environment. The period since about 1800 has been termed the ‘Anthropocene’ because of the huge impact which people have had on the world’s environment — location: [1134]()
