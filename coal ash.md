- contains coal ash, [[arsenic]], [[lead]] and [[mercury]]
- fly ash, flue ash, coal ash, or pulverised fuel ash (in the uk) –  plurale tantum: coal combustion residuals (ccrs) – is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coal-fired boilers together with the flue gases. ash that falls to the bottom of the boiler's combustion chamber (commonly called a firebox) is called bottom ash. in modern coal-fired power plants, fly ash is generally captured by electrostatic precipitators or other particle filtration equipment before the flue gases reach the chimneys. together with bottom ash removed from the bottom of the boiler, it is known as coal ash.

- depending upon the source and composition of the coal being burned, the components of fly ash vary considerably, but all fly ash includes substantial amounts of silicon dioxide (sio2) (both amorphous and crystalline), aluminium oxide (al2o3) and calcium oxide (cao), the main mineral compounds in coal-bearing rock strata.

- the minor constituents of fly ash depend upon the specific coal bed composition but may include one or more of the following elements or compounds found in trace concentrations (up to hundreds ppm): gallium, arsenic, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, hexavalent chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, selenium, strontium, thallium, and vanadium, along with very small concentrations of dioxins and pah compounds. it also has unburnt carbon.in the past, fly ash was generally released into the atmosphere, but air pollution control standards now require that it be captured prior to release by fitting pollution control equipment. in the united states, fly ash is generally stored at coal power plants or placed in landfills. about 43% is recycled, often used as a pozzolan to produce hydraulic cement or hydraulic plaster and a replacement or partial replacement for portland cement in concrete production. pozzolans ensure the setting of concrete and plaster and provide concrete with more protection from wet conditions and chemical attack.

- in the case that fly (or bottom) ash is not produced from coal, for example when solid waste is incinerated in a waste-to-energy facility to produce electricity, the ash may contain higher levels of contaminants than coal ash. in that case the ash produced is often classified as hazardous waste.
