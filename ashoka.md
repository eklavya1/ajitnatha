- • The pillars erected by Asoka furnish the finest specimen of Mauryan [[art]]. All the pillars are monoliths (carved out of stone) and the surface is well polished. They provide useful information about Ashokan Dhamma, the responsibilities of the rajukas, and about Dhammamahamattas.
 - • The majestic pillar edicts have been found at Topra, Rampurva, Nigali Sagar, Lauriya-Araraj, Lauriya Nandangarh, [[Sarnath]], and Meerut.
 - • Feroz Shah [[Tughlaq]] shifted pillars, one from Topra and the other from Meerut, to [[Delhi]].
 - • Tamluk (ancient Tamralipti), also called Tamralipta, Pali Tamalitti, town, southern West [[bengal]] state, northeastern India. It lies just south of the Rupnarayan River. Archaeological excavations have revealed a sequence of occupation going back to a period in which stone axes and crude pottery were in use, with continuous settlement from about the 3rd century BCE. Jain sources identify Tamralipti as the [[capital]] of the kingdom of Vanga. It was long known as a port. According to the Mahavamsa, an epic history of Sri Lanka, it was the departure point of Prince Vijaya’s expedition to colonize Sri Lanka (c. 500 BCE) and for the Buddhist missionary expedition dispatched by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka to Sri Lanka 250 years later. Tamralipti was also the port for [[trade]] with Southeast [[Asia]]. The Chinese pilgrim Faxian visited the city in the 5th century CE, and Xuanzang visited it in the 7th century.
