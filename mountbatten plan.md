- In June 1947, Lord Mountbatten (India's last viceroy) proposed a plan in which provinces would be declared independent successor states with the authority to choose whether or not to join the constituent assembly. Long before Mountbatten arrived in India, the freedom-with-partition formula was becoming widely accepted. One major innovation (actually proposed by [[VP Menon]]) was the immediate transfer of power based on the grant of dominion status (with a right of secession), eliminating the need to wait for a constituent assembly agreement on a new political structure.
