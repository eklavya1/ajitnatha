- [[lord mountbatten]] was given deadline of [[oct]] [[1947]] to explore options of unity & [[partition]] & within 2 months, he found that the [[cabinet mission plan]] was a `dead horse` because [[jinnah]] was adamant on [[pakistan]]
- [[partition]] could have been avoided if [[british]] had clamped down on communal violence but they continued to play ▶ passive role of mediators between [[indian national congress]] & [[muslim league]] 02:37 PM 04/8/2021
- why ?
	- [[balance of power]] :)))
	- [[george friedman]]
	- [[the world in maps pdf george friedman#^6fffe6]]
	- [[british]] were working ⚒ in their national interest of securing influence in [[south asia]] after departure 🛫 ie they played safe & adopted goal of 2 friendly dominions rather than betting on risky goal of united [[india]] which later gets partitioned via a [[civil war]] & leads to the emergence of [[pakistan]] (02:41 PM 04/8/2021) which would be anti-british because [[jinnah]] was adamant on pakistan
	- [[clement atlee]] wrote- britain wanted a united india, we tried but failed
- british tried securing good relations with both dominions by-
		1. creating pakistan, so [[muslim league]] would be pro-british
		2. _keeping pakistan as small as possible_ + ensuring princely states accede to india, therefore keeping [[indian national congress]] pro-british
- therefore in whole of [[Indian National movement]] [[cabinet mission plan]] was the only british offer of full [[independence]] _related_ [[1946]] | [[]] | [[]]
- [[indian national congress]] was ready for dominion rather than [[poorna swaraj]] 02:48 PM 04/8/2021 because wanted full executive [[power]] immediately to control communal violence
- dominion status allowed the british to keep [[india]] in commonwealth even if temporarily
- commonwealth was important for british [[trade]] & [[business]] & therefore this will be a success to show politically to the [[british]] common people 02:51 PM 04/8/2021 + early exit will allow [[britain]] to escape responsibility for communal riots
- [[jinnah]] wanted to be GG [[governor-generals]], therefore necessary link of a common governor general (02:53 PM 04/8/2021) therefore necessary link of common GG b/w 2 dominions could not be there. therefore joint defence machinery failed to last beyond December 1947 by which time [[kashmir]] was already engulfed in [[military]] conflict
- [[partition]] council - had responsibility to divide assets, `even upto typewriters` ! in matter of weeks 02:57 PM 04/8/2021
- [[gandhi]] fought against [[partition]] alone & [[lord mountbatten]] called him a `one man boundary force`
- `bipin chandra` blamed [[indian national congress]] for failing to bring [[muslim]]s into [[Indian National movement]] `03:00 PM 04/8/2021` & to nip the muslims communal forces in the bud - which were on a loose since [[1937]]. proof of this are the election results of [[1945]]-46, where [[muslim league]] won 90% of seats reserved for muslims (03:07 PM 04/8/2021)
- by June [[1947]], inc had given up because of rising communal violence in [[kolkata]] & [[bihar]]. in fact, the [[bengal]] provincial [[government]] was complicit in riots.
- inc officially referred to partition in cwc resolution in march 1947 that stated [[punjab]] & [[bengal]] would have to be partitioned if the country was to be divided. 03:11 PM 04/8/2021 therefore inc had accepted partition before 3rd June plan.
- [[indian national congress]] had accepted partition, won 90% seats reserved for [[muslim]]s
- [[gandhi]] [[jinnah]] talks on [[cr formula]] [[1944]] - here gandhi agreed to 2 dominions with one weak common centre. if a plebiscite, a muslim majority areas in favor of partition 03:14 PM 04/8/2021
- in [[cabinet mission plan]] [[1946]] inc agreed to separate sections D & C for muslim majority provinces & when british cabinet clarified tht grouping is compulsory inc accepted without much opposition. this meant [[indian national congress]] accepting [[NWFP]] to be a part of [[pakistan]] 03:18 PM 04/8/2021
- it was wishful to think that partition will be temporary & [[india]] [[pakistan]] will reunite once communal [[passion]] dies down. [[gandhi]] told inc leaders to not accept partition in hearts. 03:20 PM 04/8/2021. it was again a false belief that appeasement will weaken communalism as appeasing muslims will remove fear among them of [[hindu]] majority. rather it lead to increased prestige of [[muslim league]]
- [[gandhi]] was helpless😣not because of [[jawaharlal nehru]] or [[sardar vallabh bhai patel]] but because of communalisation of indians. he said that khalsa & [[hindu]]s desired [[partition]], [[muslim]]s already hated him. hindus and [[sikhs ☬]] abandoned him, therefore he could not start a movement against [[partition]]. 03:29 PM 04/8/2021
# responsibility of communal violence during partition
- 時 - `03:29 PM 04/8/2021`
- responsibility of [[lord mountbatten]]
1. early departure - [[punjab]] governor [[jenkins]] - "peaceful division will take years, not 72 days". commander in chief [[lockhart]] said - "punjab tragedy would not have happened if [[partition]] had been delayed by one year"
2. delay in announcing boundary [[commission]] award 03:36 PM 04/8/2021 - was announced after independence day (was ready before 15th [[aug]] !) {award means decision !!!!} so that [[britain]] could evade responsibility of communal violence that happened during [[migration]]
3. therefore on 15t [[aug]], people did not know if they were on the right side of the bordre or not. so they did not get enough time to prepare for peaceful [[migration]] resulting in a `frenzy`. also, many did not believe that partition will actually happen
# accession of [[princely states]]
- 時 - `03:47 PM 04/8/2021`
- sec 6 of goi act 1935
- [[IoA]], instrument of accession was legal instrument
- IoA was to be valid only when signed by the ruler himself
- goi act 1935 was to be applicable until GOI passed 03:49 PM 04/8/2021
- cabinet mission [[1946]]
		1. existing relationship b/w [[britain]] and [[princely states]] will end but
		2. paramountcy ie (supreme power) over [[princely states]] will not be transferred to the new government of india. the union government will have powers over subjects of defence, communication & foreign affair. rest all powers including [[residuary powers]] will be with princely states 03:51 PM 04/8/2021
		3. this was called "memorandum on states treaties & paramountcy"
		4. princely [[state]] accepted [[cabinet mission plan]] plan of [[may]] 1946, their "standing committee of chamber of princes" or [[narendra mandal]] passéd resolution that stated tha accession into union of india would be based on "negotiation " & final authority will be of each `princely state` 03:56 PM 04/8/2021

3. [[jinnah]] says - as per [[cabinet mission plan]] 1946, princely states will be independent after british leave
4. in [[jun]] [[1947]] [[lord mountbatten]] called a meeting & created a state's department 🏬 having 2 [[divisions]] or sections, one each for india & pakistan (like a home ministry) ([[sardar vallabh bhai patel]] was given the state department)
5. function of state department

		- to deal with all issues relating with princely states including their accession

# summary
Cabinet Mission Plan (Continued)

Constituent Assembly: Section A, Section B, Section C, and the Princely States
Full CA: to frame Constitution of India + Section A = Frame CoA and similarly for other sections
Each province of any section would have to abide by its group's constitution while framing laws on provincial subjects.
Union Constitution was only for central subjects. 

Atlee Statement (20 Feb 1947)

A pro Balkanisation and pro partition statement
He declared that by 30th June 1948, Britain will transfer power even if there is no Constitution. They wanted to force INC and ML into cooperation.
Princely states won't be under any subsequent GOI
Transfer of power to more than one govt if CA is not fully representative. (if ML doesn't join interim govt; to Govts in Provinces that have not joined CA)
Mountbatten will be replaced Wavell (Done in March 1947)

Mountbatten Plan

In Punjab and Bengal, a simple majority of either Muslims or Hindus in PLA in favor of partition-> will lead to the partition of India. Then a boundary commission would demarcate boundaries. (2 commissions both headed by Radcliffe)
In Sidh, there will be a plebiscite. In North Balochistan, political leaders will vote. In NWFP, there will be a referendum on the question that " whether it would join Pak or not"?
In case of partition there will be 2 CAs and 2 Dominions and not Purna Swaraj and Transfer of Power to govt at 2 centers and be preponed by a year to Aug 1947 from Jun 30, 1948.
The final decision would be taken up by the 2 CAs w.r.t Commonwealth
Since Congress accepted the partition, all of its other demands were agreed to (informally), ie. no independence to Princely states. No accession of Hyderabad to Pakistan.
Result:
Both ML and INC accepted Mountbatten Plan
This led to the Partition of India.

Indian Independence Act (July 1947)

Partition of India into 2 "independent dominions" on 15 Aug 1947.
Each dominion to be headed by GG appointed by King. Same GG for both Dominions until CA passes a law for separate GG.
End of Jurisdiction of Br Parliament on Br India on 15 Aug 1947
CA can pass a Constitution ending dominion status 
Abolition of the title "Emperor of India"
Till passage of Constitution, GOI Act 1935 to apply
Territories of India and Pakistan to be determined "before or after" appointed day by a boundary commission appointed by GG
Note: India was a dominion of Br from 15 Aug 1947 to 26 Jan 1950.

Partition of India

Lord Mountbatten was given a deadline of Oct 1947 to explore the option of unity and partition
Within 2 months, he founded that the cabinet mission was a dead horse because Jinnah was adamant about Pakistan.
Partition could have been avoided if British had clamped down on communal violence, but they continued to play the passive role of mediators b/w INC and ML.
Why? British was working in their national interest of securing influence in South Asia after their departure, ie, they played safe and adopted the goal of two friendly dominions, rather than betting on the risky goal of united India which later gets partitioned through a civil war and leads to the emergence of Pakistan which would be anti-British.
Clement Atlee wrote, "Britain wanted a united India. We tried but failed."
Br tried securing good relations with both dominions by:
Creating Pakistan, therefore ML will be pro-British.
Keeping Pakistan as small as possible + ensuring Princely states accede to India, therefore keeping INC pro-British.
Therefore, in the whole of INM, Cabinet mission 1946 was the only British offer for full independence.
INC was ready for dominion instead of Poorna Swaraj because it wanted full executive power immediately to control communal violence.
Dominion status allowed the Br to keep India in the commonwealth even if temporarily. CW was important for Br trade and business and therefore, this will be a success to show politically to Br people + early exit will allow Br to escape responsibility for communal riots.
Jinnah wanted to be GG, therefore the necessary link of a common GG b/w the 2 dominions was not there. Therefore, joint defence machinery failed to last beyond December 1947 by which time Kashmir was already engulfed in a military conflict.

Other facts related to Partition

Partition Council - had responsibilities to divide assets even up to typewriters in a matter of weeks.
Mahatma Gandhi fought against partition alone and Mountbatten called him " a one-man boundary force".

It was wishful to think that partition will be temporary and India and Pakistan will reunite once communal passion will die down
MG told INC leaders to not accept partition in hearts.
Responsibility of Mountbatten for communal violence during partition: Due to early withdrawal, Delay in announcing Boundary Commission Award

Integration of Princely States

Accession of PS was dealt with in section 6 of the GOI Act 1935. Therefore, the Instrument of Accession was a legal instrument.
This IoA was to be valid only when signed by the ruler himself. 
GOI 1935 was to be applicable until the Constitution of India (CoI) was passed. 
Cabinet mission 1946: existing relation b/w PS and Br will end. But paramountcy over PS will not be transferred to the new govt of India.
PS accepted Cabinet Mission plan. Their standing committee of Chambers of Princes (Narendra Mandal) passed a resolution that stated that accession into the union of India would be based on negotiations and the final authority will be of a princely state. 
Indian Independence Act 1947 declared the end of the paramountcy of Br over PS. PS could either join India or Pak or be independent.
Events:
565 PS, 2/5th of the land of undivided India.
June 1947: Travancore and Hyd declared they will be independent after Br leave
AICC passed a resolution: Lapse of Suzrenity of Br will not lead to the independence of PS
Jinnah: PS will be independent after Br leave
June 1947: Mountbatten called a meeting of INC and ML and created a " States Department" (Head: Sardar Patel; Secretary: VP Menon)
VP Menon's view: PS can enter into any arrangement with a dominion to whom they are geographically closer.
States dept worked under the overall guidance of Viceroy to convince the rulers to accede to India.
An IoA was drafted. It gave Defence, Communications, and Foreign Affairs to UoI and rest to PS.
Within 3 weeks all PS signed IOA (before 15 Aug 1947) except Hyd, Travancore, Junagarh (Gujarat), and Kashmir.
