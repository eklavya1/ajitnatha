# official notes
## reasons for decline of mughal

### role of aurangzeb
- mughal empire reached peak but seeds of decline also sowed.
- 50 years of warfare to capture deccan. (golconda, bijapur)
- impact:
- ↑ political strife-> marathas continued to attack post-1707 & reversed all gains of aurangzeb.
- hurt trade, esp land-based trade (but oceanic trade ↑)
- wars bled economy
- ↑ cost of warfare on mansabs as they were required to maintain army that was c/a upon for war. as a result, mansabs were not satisfied. 
- religious divisive policies alienated masses. 

## governance failure or institutional failure
- mughal state was a military state & as military weakened, state also followed.
- lack of impersonal loyalty in mansabdari system-> vulnerability to disaffection by disgruntled mansabs.

### poor military
- lack of technology reforms
- lack of military reforms
- lack of impersonal loyalty in mansabdari
- weak war commanders 

### fragile polity
- continous war of succession
- disunity was increasing as a result among nobles: iranis (persian nobles), turranis (turkish nobles), & hindustani groups (indian muslims)
- able mansabs were selfish & focused on carving their own autonomous states (bengal, awadh, hyd)

### economic reasons
- jagirdari crisis: inequity & insecurity as emperors appointed more & more mansabs to strengthen their position
- no incentive to invest in productivity of land
- corruption by mansabars

### invasions
- military weakness led to encouragement of invasions: within india & outside india
### within india:
- [[1738]], marathas plundered delhi & signed tr. of bhopal --> got suba of malwa, i.e all territories b/w river chambal & narmada.
### invasions from outside india:
- nader shah ([[1738]]-40) sacked delhi & became emperor for 2 months. this was a tremendous blow to prestige of md shah ([[1719]]-48).
- afghan invasions by abdali in [[1748]], [[1756]]-61, & [[1799]]- by zaman shah (successor of abdali).
- military weakness also encouraged internal rebellions in form of peasant revolts of early 18th century. [[romance of the three kingdoms]]
- these factors became major reasons for decline of mughal.

### wars of succession
- jahandar shah killed father of farukh siyar to come to power. 
- farukh siyar killed jahandar shah with help of sayyid brothers of hindustani group.
- f.siyar now wanted to clip wings of s.brothers.
- this led to sayyid brothers defeating f.siyar in a battle. he was blinded & then killed.
- then, muhammad shah was established as a puppet ruler. 
- turrnai group, led by chin qulich khan (later nizam of hyd), defeated sayyid brothers & restored status of md. shah.
- cqk was made wazir (1722-24).
- sadat ali khan (1722-40; nawab of awadh) sided with nadir shah  b/c he wasn't made mir bakshi, ie., imperial treasurer, & post was given to cqk.
- this is evidence of lack of control of mughal emperor on his governors & court politics resulting in fragile polity. 
- able but selfish nobles established themselves as autonomous governors of regions:
	- sadat ali khan: awadh
	- murshid quli khan (1717-27)- bengal
	- cqk: hyderabad
- some terms: wazir= prime minister; nawab= governor; nazim= nawab; nizam is a title taken by nawab of hyd

## attacks on mughals (contd)
### impact of nadir shah's attacks:
- loss of prestige: defeat; meek behavior of md shah; delhi massacre
- economic impact: took away kohinoor & peacock throne; took away a huge amount of gold, workers, etc
- economic impact led to military weakness. 
- nizam shifted to hyderabad permanently in [[1740]]
### afghan invasions:
[[romance of the three kingdoms]]
- mughals came under protection of marathas in [[1752]] on account of fear of afghan invasions led by ahmed shah abdali.
- [[1756]]-61: afghans succeeded under abdali, but failed in [[1748]] & [[1799]] (under zaman shah)
- series of battles culminating in 3rd battle of panipat ([[1761]]). 
- reasons for defeat of marathas in 3rd battle of panipat:
- weak alliances of maratha as awadh, sikhs, jats, sikhs did not support them due to their plundering.
- supply of marathas was cut off
- afghan had better artillery [[mongol]] [[genghis khan]]
- not all maratha chiefs were united.
### result:
- abdali looted india
- power of marathas declined after [[1761]]  b/c of a huge defeat.
- within weeks after war, nana saheb ([[1740]]-61) died leading to fragile polity among marathas. 

## successor states (bengal, hyd, awadh)
- within mughal empires, certain powerful nobles established autonomous centers of power in form of successor states. 
### how these nobles consolidated their hold on provinces?
- gathering support of economically powerful sections such as traders, moneylenders, bankers.
- efficient revenue administration for monetary strength of state.
- they started putting loyalists in important official positions.
- they decreased financial reporting revenue to delhi.
- gradually, amount was also reduced.
- autonomy in appointing officials, i.e., giving mansabs & jagirs w/o permission of mughal emperor
- exercised autonomy in important matters like war & peace.
