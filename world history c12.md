## Themes (1929-1939): Run up to World War 2
Themes (1929-1939): Run up to World War 2  (9:00:00 AM)

Rise of Communism due to Great Depression of 1929. It resulted in the discredit of capitalism.
Communism advocated the violent overthrow of capitalism. That means the end of the profit motive and private property.
High inflation and unemployment in Italy due to the result of WW1. Mussolini created fear of the communist in Italy. He projected himself as the enemy of the communist.
Rise of Fascism, as Fascist leaders projected themselves as saviour of the capitalism and of life and property and promised law and order (L&O).
It resulted in the rise of Hitler and he became Chancellor of Germany in 1933.
Post-1933: Hitler started breaking the Treaty of Versailles by adopting foreign policy.
Therefore World should have acted against Hitler but due to Great Depression, it was neither viable nor feasible for the UK to go for the war. The same was the case with the other countries of Europe.
The Great Depression of 1929 led to economic weakness therefore rest of the country cannot afford the war. Therefore the world did not act against the aggressive foreign policy of the Fascist regimes. This was referred to as the policy of appeasement.
At times world leaders sought to end the reason for war that means tried to remove unjust aspects of the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore they supported the demands of Hitler.
There was a lack of unity amongst the leaders of Western Europe. For Example, Right wings politicians viewed a strong Germany as a buffer against a communist USSR.
The rise of three ideologies Capitalist, Communist, and Fascist created confusion that who are with together and who are against.
Fascism was based on extreme nationalism. Fascism is also based on anti-communism.
The policy of appeasement towards fascism was the biggest reason for WW2.
This policy appeasement helped in rise of the domestic popularity of fascists because of the success of fascists in their foreign policy.
Fascists came to believe that the world will never act against their aggression. Therefore they became more aggressive that ultimately making WW2 more inevitable.
Military and economic strengthening of the Fascists. In 1935, Conscription was introduced, and territories were annexed by Hitler.
The sanctity or Credibility of the League of Nations got hurt due to actions of the Britain and France. League of Nations failed.
Overall Impact of the policy of appeasement was WW2. The policy of Appeasement was because of the Great depression.
WW1 created a crisis that is important for the revolution. WW1 gave way for the rise of communism. This gave rise to fascism.

## Events Post Great Depression Until WW2 (1939)
Events Post Great Depression Until WW2 (1939) (9:55:00 AM)

1931, Japan attacked Manchuria due to the impact of the Great depression and fear of the rise of communism in Japan. Japan was an export-oriented economy, Great depression also hurt it. 1916 to 1928 was the Warlord Era. China also wanted to develop itself as an industrial and capitalist economy.
China went for help from the League of Nations. Japan did not follow the order of the League of Nations but the League of Nations did not interfere.
Washington Conference was also failed.
The civilian government in Japan did not know the war action of its military. The later military overthrew this civilian government.
Japan Created a puppet state in Manchuria in 1931.
In 1937, a full invasion of China took place and it resulted at the beginning of the 2nd Sino-Japanese War that continued till 1945. It merged into WW2.
In 1931, the customs union between Germany and Austria was rejected by the League of Nations as it violates the Treaty of Versailles. It was done under the influence of France. 
Hitler became Chancellor in 1933.

Hitler demanded universal disarmament and asked France for disarmament but France rejected it. Hitler withdrew from the League of Nations. In 1934 Hitler introduced rearmament in Germany.
In 1933, Italy and USSR signed a non-aggression pact.
Italy was threatened by the rise of Hitler and as expected the possible aggression by Germany in near future.
Thus the rise of Hitler resulted in the pause of rivalry between capitalism and communism.

In 1934, USSR was allowed to join the League of Nations. USSR joined the League of Nations.
To counter it, in 1934, Germany and Poland signed Non-Aggression Pact. Poland was weary of the Policy of Appeasement.
The alliance among France, Yugoslavia, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.
In 1934, the first attempt at Anschluss was defeated by Italy.
In 1935, Britain, France, and Italy entered into the Stresa Front. It was based on the promise that if Hitler tries to take any part of Czechoslovakia, Poland, or Austria the Stresa Front will take action against Germany.
In 1935, the British were following the policy of the Carrot and Stick. Stresa Front was the stick. Then tried to bring carrot as the Britain-German Naval Agreement. By this Britain tried to remove the harsh aspect of the Treaty of Versailles. It was an example of the Policy of the Appeasement.
In 1935, Italy attacked Abyssinia. Italy attacked Abyssinia as it needed resources and to build up the image of Mussolini.
1896 Battle of Adwa where Italians underestimated Abyssinia and got defeated.
Abyssinia approached the League of Nations. Britain and France wanted to provide carrots for Italy and also save the image of the League of Nations. To save the image of the League of Nations, they imposed a mild sanction to show their actions.
However, Mussolini was concerned with his image. Germany did not comment on the Attack on Abyssinia.
As a result, Italy withdrew from the Stresa Front and Stresa Front failed in 1935 itself due to Mussolini felt cheated by Britain.
Now because of this event, Mussolini started moving closure to Hitler.
In 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome-Berlin Axis. In 1936, Japan-Germany signed an Anti-Comintern Pact. Hitler wanted to send the message to France, Italy, and Britain that he is against the USSR and not against the Western European capitalist country. The left and right-wing of France got divided.
In 1936, the Spanish Civil War started. Mussolini and Hitler supported the Right-wing army under Franco. Hitler bombed Span on the civilian population. The nationalistic population of Germany supported Hitler.
Spain became fascist under Franco but did not join the WW2 to save the destruction of the War.
In 1937, Italy also joined Anti-Comintern Pact.
In 1938, Anschluss with Austria was completed by Hitler.
Hitler threatened Austria that he will make Vienna as Spain of Austria.
In 1938, Munich Conference was called by the world leader, and the Sudetenland was offered to Hitler. Czechoslovakia was not invited to the Sudetenland.
It was the peak of the Policy of the Appeasement.
In 1939, Hitler Annexed the rest of Czechoslovakia. France and Britain did not come to support Czechoslovakia.
In 1939, Hitler signed a 10 years non-aggression pact between Germany and USSR. They agreed to attack Poland from their own sides. By signing this pact Hitler also expected to minimize the two-front wars.
USSR is accused here as the cause of WW2. USSR also gave logic that 10 years time he wanted to use as the preparation for the war.
Thus in 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, and Second World War begins.
Poland was defeated before assistance from Britain reached Poland.
6-month Phoney War.
Until 1942 Germany was very successful.
In 1942, Germany attacked USSR and broke the 10 years non-aggression pact.
Japan attacked the East Asian region and defeated most of them.
The US was against the Japanese advance in South-East Asia.

## Reasons for the World War 2
Reasons for the World War 2(11:45:00 AM)

Unjust Treaties of the Versailles.
Great Depression 1929 led to rise of Hitler in Germany, Military fascism in Japan, and the Policy of Appeasement. Therefore all these resulted in the failure of the League of Nations.
Role of Hitler: He wanted to annex all German populated areas and destroy the Treaty of Versailles and made war more likely. Some scholars argued that the ultimate goal was Lebensraum (Living Space) for future German generations by annexing all lands to the east of Germany to the Ural mountain. If this was his goal then WW2 was inevitable.
USSR is blamed because it signed 10 years Non-aggression Pact in 1939 with Germany. It led to the prevention of the two-front war for Germany. Therefore increased confidence in Hitler to wage war.
USSR defence: It wanted to buy time for the military preparation for the future German attack and wanted a buffer zone by capturing half of Poland. Also, there was no guarantees that western capitalist nations would come to the military aid of the USSR when Germany attacked.
Therefore disunity between USSR and Western Capitalist world that is distrust due to rivalry between Capitalism and Communism prevented a timely joint stand against Axis Powers.

## Highlights and features of World War II
Highlights and features of World War II  (11:58:00 AM)

Until 1942, Germany was very successful. The reason was German Blitzkrieg (a military tactic that involved a simultaneous, rapid, and a massive attack by air and ground troops to create shock and awe resulted in a quick victory over the enemy.
Germany defeated France: France was unprepared. Lack of military alliance with USSR like in the WWI with Russia. Six months phoney war i.e that if France would had not followed the defensive approach and therefore not given time to Germany, Germany may had been defeated earlier.
*France neglected the air force* and its infantry *did not move in the motorized divisions* resulted in *slow troops* move. [[george friedman]]

## Why Axis Power Lost
Why Axis Power Lost   (12:10:00 PM)

There was a resource imbalance. The US was the largest [[economy]], Britain had the largest colonial empire and USSR’s economy had industrialized by 1939 and had huge resources, and had the largest army in the [[world]]. Therefore the longer the [[war]] the lesser the chances of the Axis victory.
The US focussed more on the [[production]] of Aircraft carriers while Japan on Battleships.
[[Italy]] proved to be a weak ally and Germany had to rescue the Italian forces on multiple occasions, therefore, weakening Germany against the USSR.
Two big mistakes by Axis powers. The first attack on USSR and US was in [[1941]]. Thus it tilted the balance decisively in favour of the allied power.
Germany lost the important Battle of [[stalingrad]] against the USSR because the german forces came unprepared for the harsh Russian weather and the anticipated quick victory did not come. #wo_de like how [[afghanistan]] is called the graveyard of civilizations, same happened with [[napoleon bonaparte]], both lost to [[russia]]

## Result of the WWII
Result of the WWII (12:17:00 PM)

Huge destruction. More than 40 million died of which half were Russian.
Around 60 lakh Jews were killed by Hitler in Europe in Holocaust. The US drops a nuclear bomb on Japan to force Japan to surrender. Thus world became a nuclear world and a more dangerous world.
Italy lost all colonies, Japan lost all colonies and USSR brought eastern Europe under its domination and annexed Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and some territory of Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania.
Germany and Austria continue to be occupied by the Armies of France, the US, Britain, and the USSR.
The decline of Europe and the rise of the two superpowers US and USSR.
Beginning of the Cold War ([[1945]]-[[1991]])
Establishment of the United Nations as a replacement of the League of the Nations.
The weakening of Europe led to the beginning of decolonization.
Fear of communism and fear of the repeat of the World War led to the foundation of unity in Western Europe in form of the European Economic community in [[1956]] that later expanded into the European Union.
