[[2022-04-24]] 16:39 [Second Anglo-Mysore War - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Second_Anglo-Mysore_War)
The Second Anglo-Mysore War was a conflict between the Kingdom of Mysore and the British East India Company from [[1780]] to [[1784]]. At the time, Mysore was a key French ally in India, and the conflict between Britain against the French and Dutch in the American Revolutionary War sparked Anglo-Mysorean hostilities in India. The great majority of soldiers on the company side were raised, trained, paid and commanded by the company, not the British government. However, the company's operations were also bolstered by Crown troops sent from Britain, and by troops from Hanover,[1] which was also ruled by Britain's King George III.
