# judicial review of national emergency
(2.59 pm)
extent of [[judicial review]] [[power]] concerning article 352 _[[a352 Proclamation of Emergency]]_ involves examining:

	- it was supposed to be a _dead letter_ by constituent assembly.
	- term "failure of constitutional machinery" is not defined in [[constitution]].
	- if president is satisfied that govt of state can not be carried under provision of constitution then president can invoke a proclamation for failure of constitutional machinery in state.
	- president can do this based on a report from governor or by himself also.
## effect of proclamation under article 356:
- on executive power of state:
	- all executive powers of state are assumed by president & president of india exercise these powers on advice of centre coms.

	- introduced a new provision to put a restraint on power of parliament to extend a proclamation of presidentâ€™s rule beyond 1 year.
	- it provided that, beyond 1 year, presidentâ€™s rule can be extended by six months at a time only when foll 2 conditions are fulfilled:
		- a proclamation of national emergency should be in operation in whole of india, or whole or any part of state.
		- election commission must certify that general elections to legislative assembly of concerned state cannot be held on account of difficulties.
- revocation of article 356:
	- a proclamation of presidentâ€™s rule may be revoked by president at any time by a subsequent proclamation.
	- such a proclamation does not require parliamentary approval.
	- there is no provision of written advice of cabinet for article 356.
article 355 _[[a355]]_:
	- it shall be duty of union to protect every state against external aggression & internal disturbance & to ensure that govt of every state is carried on by provisions of this constitution.
	- thus article 356 can be invoked on grounds of 355 of indian constitution also.
article 365:
	- president can also invoke a proclamation under article 356 if state govts refuse to comply with directive of central govt under article 365.
