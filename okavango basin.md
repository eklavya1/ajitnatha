The Kalahari Basin, also known as the Kalahari Depression or the Okavango Basin, is an endorheic basin and large lowland area covering over 2.5 million km2 covering most of [[botswana]] and [[Namibia]], as well as parts of [[Angola]], [[South Africa]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. The outstanding physical feature in the basin, and occupying the centre, is the large Kalahari Desert.

The perennial river bifurcation of Selinda Spillway (or Magweggana River), on the Cuando River, connects the Kalahari basin to the Zambezi Basin.
