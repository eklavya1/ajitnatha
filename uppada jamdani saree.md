Uppada is on the east coastline and is about 25 kms north east of Kakinada district head quarters and a port town in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is understood that the technique of jamdani weaving was passed on from West Bengal to Uppada. Fascinating, unique and alternative extra weft designs are produced on plain fabric in jamdani weaving. In jamdani fabrics, designs intermingled with the basic plain ground weave are produced and therefore they look pretty and artistic. Jamdani weaving is locally called ‘Ani Butta’ weaving, “ANI” means “SHED”.
