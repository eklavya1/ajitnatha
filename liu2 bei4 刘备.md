- liu bei (chinese: 劉備, pronunciation ; mandarin pronunciation: [ljǒʊ pêɪ]; 161 – summer 223), courtesy name xuande (玄德), was a warlord in late eastern han dynasty who founded state of shu han in 3 kingdoms period & became its 1st ruler. alhough he was a distant relative of han imperial family, liu bei's father died when he was a child & left his family impoverished. to help his mother, he sold shoes & straw mats. when he reached age of fifteen, his mother sent him to study _ lu zhi. in his youth, liu bei was k/a ambitious & charismatic. he gathered a militia army to fight yellow turbans. liu bei fought bravely in many battles & grew famousfr his exploits. rather than join coalition against dong zhuo, he joined his childhood friend gongsun zan & fought _ him against yuan shao.

later he was sent to help tao qian against cao cao. thanks to support of influential mi & chen families along with provisions in tao qian's last will, liu bei inherited xu province. after his defeat against cao cao, lü bu joined him. however, lü bu took advantage of liu bei being away fighting yuan shu & seized xu province. later liu bei joined cao cao & they defeated lü bu at battle of xiapi. although he was treated well by cao cao, liu bei received a secret edict fm emperor to kill cao cao. so, he rebelled against cao cao taking back xu province. after a brief alliance with yuan shao, liu bei was quickly defeated by cao cao & had to flee to join yuan shao in north. he was sent by yuan shao to create uprisings behind cao cao's main base, bt he was ultimately defeated by cao cao & joined his kinsman liu biao. liu biao doubted liu bei's loyalty, so he sent him to xinye to serve as a shield against cao cao. after liu biao's death, liu bei & his supporters joined liu qi in xiakou where they allied with sun quan. together they opposed cao cao at battle of red cliffs.

after cao cao's defeat, liu bei quickly took control of majority of jing province. he then married sun quan's sister. sun quan then recognised legitimacy of liu bei's control of jing province & agreed to "lend" him nan commandery. liu bei later led his army to join another kinsman, liu zhang, in his war against warlord zhang lu. based on advice of his advisors, liu bei betrayed liu zhang & seized yi province fm him. after engaging in a series of conflicts with sun quan & seeing cao cao's coming closer to yi province, liu bei agreed to yield 1/2 of jing province to sun quan & led his army against xiahou yuan at hanzhong & seized it. liu bei then declared himself "king of hanzhong" & set up his headquarters in chengdu. however soon after his senior general guan yu was killed by liu bei's "ally" sun quan who took rest of jing province. liu bei was furious & after declaring himself emperor to challenge cao pi's authority, he led his army against his former ally. though some early success, his army was soon forced into a stalemate against sun quan general lu xun & was subsequently defeated. ashamed by his failure, he never returned to chengdu & settled in baidicheng where he lived until his death 1 year later. urged his heir, liu shan nt to emulate him & rather be as virtuous as possible. before he died liu bei appointed zhuge liang to advise his son on domestic matters with li yan to advise him on military matters.

despite early failings & lacking both material resources & social status his rivals commanded, he gathered support among disheart nd han loyalists who opposed cao cao, warlord who controlled han central govt & figurehead emperor xian & led a popular movement to restore han dynasty. liu bei overcame a number of setbacks to carve out his own realm, wch at its peak spanned present-day sichuan, chongqing, guizhou, hunan, & parts of hubei & gansu.

culturally, due to popularity of 14th-century historical novel romance of 3 kingdoms, liu bei is widely regarded as ideal benevolent & humane ruler who caredfr his people & selected good advisersfr his govt. his fictional counterpart in novel was a salutary ex of a ruler who adhered to confucian set of moral values, such as loyalty & compassion. historically, liu bei, like many han rulers, was greatly influenced by laozi. he was a brilliant politician & leader whose skill was a remarkable demonstration of "confucian in appearance bt legalist in substance".
