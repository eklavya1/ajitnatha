- An endonym (from Greek: éndon, 'inner' + ónoma, 'name'; also known as autonym) is a common, native name for a geographical place, group of people, individual person, language or dialect, meaning that it is used inside that particular place, group, or linguistic community in question; it is their self-designated name for themselves, their homeland, or their language.
- An **exonym** (from Greek: éxō, 'outer' + ónoma, 'name'; also known as xenonym) is a common, non-native name for a geographical place, group of people, individual person, language or dialect, meaning that it is used only outside that particular place, group, or linguistic community. Exonyms exist not only for historico-geographical reasons, but also in consideration of difficulties when pronouncing foreign words.For instance, Deutschland is the endonym for the country that is also known by the exonym Germany in English and Allemagne in French.
