# Species Conservation
(1:09 PM)

## IUCN
- [[iucn]] (Internation Union for Conservation of Nature)
- It was established in [[1948]] as IUPN
- HQ: GLAND,[[switzerland]]
- Presence in more than 160 countries
- A partnership led environment organization (more than 300 governmental organizations and 1000 NGOs)
5 Priority Areas:
	1. Biodiversity
	2. Climate Change
	3. Green Energy
	4. Green Economy
	5. Human well-being 
- Species Survival Commission (SSC) of IUCN contributes to the preparation of the Red Data Book. (In India, Red Data Book is published by Zoological Survey of India)
- World Conservation Union (WCU) of IUCN organizes" World Conservation Congress" every [[4]] years. ([[2021]]: Marseille (France); 2016: Hawai)
- Note: IUCN has been given Observer member status to UN General assembly - It means that they can participate in all the discussions, summits, conferences and even can put reports in GA. However, Observer member does not have voting rights.

# IUCN Red Data Book
(1:35 PM) [[iucn#^afe5b7]]
It has 9 categories based on risks to extinction  #todo 
- All Species: Sufficient data and Data Deficient; Not Evaluated.
1. Extinct - when the last member of particular species has not been found e.g., Caspian tiger
2. Extinct in wild - They are not totally extinct. few of the members conserved in captive breeding. But itâ€™s at the brink of extinction if not conserved.
3. Critically endangered species(C) - More than 90% decline in population in last 10 years or three generations of the species e.g., Vulture, Gharial, etc
4. Endangered category (EN) - where 70 -80 % decline has been observed in last 10 years or in three-generation e.g., Asian Tiger.
5. Vulnerable (Vu) - 50-70 % decline in last 10 years or across three-generation e.g. Great one-horned rhino, Olive rudely turtle.
6. Near threatened (NT) - Earlier there was no threat but because of development activities they have been exposed.
7. Least concerned (LC) - As of now, these species face no threats causing extinction.
8. Not evaluated for risks
9. Data deficient.

Threatened categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable.

Conservation categories: Extinct in wild, Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened.
