2022 World Inequality Report (WIR):
Key findings
	- [ ]  gap between  rich and  poor in terms of share of national income is quite large, and growing rapidly as a result of government policies that favour affluent elite. richest 10% of global population takes home 52% of global income, whereas poorest 50% got only 8.5% of it.
	- [ ] Global wealth inequities are worse than income inequalities. While poorest 50% own just 2% of the global wealth, richest 10% own 76% of all wealth.
	- [ ] Inequality between countries was narrowing while inequality within countries was increasing. While the gap between average incomes of richest 10% of countries and average incomes of the poorest 50% of countries has dropped from 50x to less than 40x, gap between average incomes of top 10% and bottom 50% of individuals within countries has almost doubled, from 8.5x to 15x.

Countries are growing richer, governments are becoming poorer. The share of privately owned wealth in national wealth was rising, while that of public wealth (buildings, universities, roads, hospitals etc) was shrinking.
India is one of the world's most unequal countries, with the top 1% getting 21.7% of the national income.
The top 10% of Indians capture 57% of the national income, while the share of the bottom 50% is only 13%.

published by - [[world inequality lab]] reducing emissions from deforestation & forest degradation (REDD+)
reducing emissions from deforestation & forest degradation (redd) is a set of steps designed to use market/financial incentives in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from deforestation & forest degradation. 
o it was first negotiated under united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) in 2005, with objective of mitigating climate change through reducing net emissions of greenhouse gases through enhanced forest management in developing countries.
o most of key redd+ decisions were completed by 2013, with final pieces of rulebook finished in 2015.
o its original objective is to reduce greenhouse gases but it's claimed that it can deliver "co-benefits" such as biodiversity conservation & poverty alleviation.
o "reducing emissions from deforestation & forest degradation" implies a distinction b/w 2 activities.
deforestation is permanent removal of forests & withdrawal of land from forest use.
forest degradation refers to negative changes in forest area that limit its production capacity.
redd is sometimes presented as "offset" scheme of carbon markets & thus, would produce carbon credits.
main actors: redd activities are undertaken by national or local govemments, dominant ngos, private sector, or any combination of these.
o it's being pushed strongly by world bank & un for setting up bases for carbon market & legal & governance frameworks of countries receiving redd.
