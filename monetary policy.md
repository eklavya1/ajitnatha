It is implemented by the country's central bank. In the case of India, it is the Reserve Bank ([[RBI]]) which implements monetary policy.
It refers to credit control measures used by the [[central bank]] to regulate and control the level of [[credit]] creation by commercial banks.
Lack of credit facilities results in a fall in [[money supply]] and [[deflation]] or deficiency in [[demand]] in the [[economy]]. <u>Monetary policy aims at controlling the excess or deficiency in demand.</u>

The [[bank rate]] is the rate at which the central bank discounts the securities of the commercial banks. It is also the rate at which commercial banks borrow [[money]] from the central bank. The central bank can decrease the bank rate to increase the money supply in the economy.

*Thus the central bank can decrease the bank rate to cure deflation.*
[[Cash Reserve Ratio]] (CRR) is a specified minimum fraction of the total deposits of customers, which commercial banks have to hold as reserves either in cash or as deposits with the central bank. The lower the CRR, the higher liquidity with the banks, which in turn goes into investment and lending and vice-versa. Though, RBI decreases CRR to fight [[deflation]].

Under the [[Reverse Repo Rate]], banks deposit excess funds with the RBI and earn interest for it. An increase in the Reverse Repo Rate provides an incentive to the banks to park their surplus funds with the central bank on a short-term basis, thereby reducing liquidity in the banking system. Therefore, to fight deflation, the Reverse Repo Rate is kept lower to discourage banks from keeping surplus funds with RBI as against lending them to individuals and businesses.
