## In the Census of India migration is enumerated on two bases
o Place of birth, if the place of birth is different from the place of enumeration (known as lifetime migrant);
o Place of residence, if the place of the last residence is different from the place of enumeration (known as migrant by place of last residence).
The distribution of male and female migrants in different streams of intra-state and inter-state migration is presented in the adjoining figures. It is clearly evident that females predominate the streams of short-distance rural to rural migration in both types of migration.
Contrary to this, men predominate the rural to an urban stream of inter-state migration due to economic reasons.
