The Irrawaddy River (official romanisation: Ayeyarwady River; Burmese: ဧရာဝတီမြစ်; MLCTS: erawa.ti mrac, pronounced [ʔèjàwədì mjɪʔ], from Indic revatī, meaning "abounding in riches") is a river that flows from north to south through [[Myanmar]] (Burma). It is country's largest river  & most important commercial waterway. Originating from confluence of N'mai  & Mali rivers, it flows relatively straight North-South before emptying through Irrawaddy Delta in Ayeyarwady Region into Andaman Sea. Its drainage basin of about 404,200 square kilometres (156,100 sq mi) covers a large part of Burma. After Rudyard Kipling's poem, it is sometimes referred to as **'The Road to Mandalay'.**

As early as sixth century, river was used for trade  & transport. Having developed an extensive network of irrigation canals, river became important to British Empire after it had colonized Burma. river is still as vital today, as a considerable amount of (export) goods  & traffic moves by river. Rice is produced in Irrawaddy Delta, irrigated by water from river.

In 2007, Myanmar's military dictatorship signed an agreement for construction of seven hydroelectric dams, yielding a total 13,360 MW, in N'mai  & Mali Rivers, including 3600 MW Myitsone Dam at confluence of both rivers. Environmental organisations have raised concerns about ecological impacts on river's biodiverse ecosystems. Animals potentially impacted include endangered Irrawaddy dolphin  & critically endangered Ganges shark.
