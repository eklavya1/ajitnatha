- "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (originally "The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere") is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, written in [[1797]]â€“98 and published in [[1798]] in the first edition of Lyrical Ballads. Some modern editions use a revised version printed in [[1817]] that featured a gloss.[1] Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it is often considered a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.[2]
