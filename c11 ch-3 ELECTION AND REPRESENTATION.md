 Have you ever played chess? What would happen if the black knight suddenly started moving straight rather than two 和 a half squares? Or, what would  happen if in a game of cricket, there were no umpires? In any sport, we need to  follow certain rules. Change the rules 和 the outcome of the game would be  very different. Similarly a game needs an impartial umpire whose decision is  accepted by all the players. The rules 和 the umpire have to be agreed upon  before we begin to play a game. What is true of a game is also true of elections.  There are different rules or systems of conducting elections. The outcome of the  election depends on the rules we have adopted. We need some machinery to  conduct the elections in an impartial manner. Since these two decisions need to  be taken before the game of electoral politics can begin, these cannot be left to  any government. That is why these basic decisions about elections are written  down in the constitution of a democratic country.
 
 In this chapter we shall study the constitutional provisions regarding elections 和 representation. We shall focus on the importance of the method of election  chosen in our Constitution 和 the implications of the constitutional provisions  regarding impartial machinery for conducting elections. We shall also look at  some suggestions for amending the constitutional provisions in this respect. After  reading this chapter, you would understand:
 ± different methods of election;
 ± the characteristics of the system of election adopted in our country;
 ± the importance of the provisions for free 和 fair elections; and
 ± the debate on electoral reforms.
  
 # ELECTIONS 和 DEMOCRACY
Let us begin by asking ourselves two simple questions about elections 和 democracy.

± Can we have democracy without holding elections?
± Can we hold elections without having democracy?

Let us have a discussion in the classroom on both these questions
by using examples from whatever we have learnt so far in the previous
classes.

The first question reminds us of ==the necessity of representation in a large democracy==. All citizens cannot take direct part in making every decision. ∴,
representatives are elected by the people. This is how elections become important. Whenever we think of India as a democracy, our mind invariably turns to the last elections. Elections have today become the most visible symbol of the democratic process. We often distinguish between direct 和 indirect democracy. A direct democracy is one where the citizens directly participate in the day-to-day decision-making 和 in the running of the government. The ancient city-states in Greece were considered examples of direct democracy. Many would consider local governments, especially gram sabhas, to be the closest examples of direct

They say elections are carnival of democracy. But this cartoon depicts chaos instead. Is this true of elections always? Is it good for democracy?

democracy. But this kind of direct democracy cannot be practiced when a decision has to be taken by lakhs 和 crores of people. That is why rule by the people usually   means rule by people’s representatives.  
In such an arrangement citizens choose their representatives who, in turn, are actively involved in governing 和 administering the country. The method  
followed to choose these representatives is referred to as an election. Thus, the citizens have a limited role in taking major decisions 和 in running the administration. They are not very actively involved in making of the policies.  
Citizens are involved only indirectly, through their elected  
representatives. In this arrangement, where all major  
decisions are taken by elected representatives, the method  
by which people elect their representatives becomes very  
important.  
The second question reminds us of the fact that not all elections are democratic. A large number of non-democratic countries also hold elections. ==In fact non-   democratic rulers are very keen to present themselves as   democratic. They do so by holding election in such a way   that it does not threaten their rule==. Can you think of some examples of such non-democratic elections? ([[china]] , [[russia]]) What do you think would distinguish a democratic from a non democratic election? What can be done to ensure that elections in a country would be conducted in a democratic way?
- This is where constitution comes in. The constitution of a democratic country lays down some basic rules about elections. The details are usually left to be worked out by laws passed by the legislatures. These basic rules are usually about 
± Who is eligible to vote?
± Who is eligible to contest?  
± Who is to supervise elections?  
± How do the voters choose their representatives?  
± How are the votes to be counted 和 representatives elected?

What is the need of writing these rules in the constitution? Why can’t these be decided by the Parliament? Or by all the parties before every election?

Like most democratic constitutions, the Constitution of India answers all these questions. As you can see, the first three questions are about ensuring that elections are free 和 fair 和 can thus be called democratic. The last two questions are about ensuring a fair representation. In this chapter you will consider both these aspects of the Constitutional provisions about elections.

 # ELECTION SYSTEM IN INDIA
You may have noted above a reference to different methods or the systems of elections. You may have wondered what these were all about. You may have seen or read about different methods of electioneering or campaigning in the elections. But what are different methods of elections? There is a system of conducting elections. There are authorities 和 rules about do’s 和 don’ts. Is that what election system is all about? You may have wondered why the constitution needs to write down how the votes are to be counted and representatives elected. Isn’t that very obvious? People go 和 vote. The candidate who gets highest votes gets elected. That is what elections are all over the world. Why do we need to think about it? We need to, because this question is not as simple as it appears to us. We have got so used to our system of elections that we think that there cannot be any other way. In a democratic election, people vote 和 their preference decides who will win the contest. But there

can be very different ways in which people make their choices 和 very different ways in which their preferences can be counted. These   different rules of the game can make a difference to who the winner   of the game will be. Some rules can favour bigger parties; some rules   can help the smaller players. Some rules can favour the majority   community, others can protect the minorities. Let us look at one   dramatic instance to see how this happens.

# First Past the Post System  
Look at the newspaper clipping.

Activity
Hold mock elections in your class to elect four class
representatives. Hold the election in three different ways:
± Each student can give one vote. The four highest vote getters
are elected.
± Each student has four votes 和 can give them all to one
candidate or split the votes among different candidates. The
four highest vote getters are elected.
± Each voter gives a preference ranking to candidates 和 the
counting follows the method of election of Rajya Sabha
members described below.
Did the same four persons win the election in each of these
methods? If not, what was the difference? Why?

It talks of one historic moment in India’s democracy. In the Lok Sabha elections of 1984, the Congress party came to power winning 415 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats – more than 80% of the seats. Such a victory was never achieved by any party in the Lok Sabha. What did this election show?

The Congress party won four-fifths of the seats. Does it mean that four out of five Indian voters voted for the Congress party? Actually not. Take a look at the enclosed table. The Congress party got 48% of the votes. This means that only 48% of those who voted, voted in favour of the candidates put up by the Congress party, but the party still managed to win more than 80% of the seats in the Lok Sabha. Look at the performance of other parties. The BJP got 7.4 per cent votes but less than one per cent seats. How did that happen?

_Less than 50 per cent votes 和  
more than 80 per cent seats!  
Isn’t that unfair? How could  
our Constitution makers accept  
such an unfair system?_

Votes 和 seats won by some major parties

Party Votes (%) Seats
Congress 48.0 415
BJP 7.4 2
Janata 6.7 10
Lok Dal 5.7 3
CPI (M) 5.7 22
Telugu Desam 4.1 30
DMK 2.3 2
AIADMK 1.6 12
Akali Dal 1.0 7
AGP 1.0 7

This happened because in our country we follow a
special method of elections. Under this system:
± The entire country is divided into 543 constituencies;
± Each constituency elects one representative; and
± The candidate who secures the highest number of
votes in that constituency is declared elected.

It is important to note that in this system whoever has more votes than all other candidates, is declared elected.The winning candidate need not secure a majority of the  
votes. This method is called the First Past the Post (FPTP)  
system. In the electoral race, the candidate who is ahead  
of others, who crosses the winning post first of all, is the  
winner. This method is also called the Plurality System.  
This is the method of election prescribed by the  Constitution.  

Let us now go back to our example. The Congress  
party won greater share of seats than its share of votes  
because in many of the constituencies in which its  
candidates won, they secured less than 50% of the votes.  
If there are several candidates, the winning candidate often  
gets much less than 50% of the votes. The votes that go to  
all the losing candidates go ‘waste’, for those candidates  
or parties get no seat from those votes. Suppose a party  
gets only 25 per cent of the votes in every constituency,  
but everyone else gets even less votes. In that case, the  
party could win all the seats with only 25 per cent votes  
or even less.

# Proportional Representation  
Let us compare this to how elections take place in Israel  
that follows a very different system of elections. In Israel  
once the votes are counted, each party is allotted the share  
of seats in the parliament in proportion to its share of  
votes (see Box). Each party fills its quota of seats by picking  
those many of its nominees from a preference list that has  
been declared before the elections. This system of elections  
is called the Proportional Representation (PR) system. In  
this system a party gets the same proportion of seats as  
its proportion of votes.  
In the PR system there could be two variations. In  
some countries, like Israel or Netherlands, the entire  
country is treated as one constituency 和 seats are  
allocated to each party according to its share of votes in  
the national election. The other method is when the  
country is divided into several multi-member

constituencies as in Argentina 和 Portugal. Each party prepares a
list of candidates for each constituency, depending on how many
have to be elected from that constituency. In both these variations,
voters exercise their preference for a party 和 not a candidate. The
seats in a constituency are distributed on the basis of votes polled
by a party. Thus, representatives from a constituency, would and
do belong to different parties. In India, we have adopted PR system

Proportional Representation in Israel
Israel follows proportional representation system of election. Elections to
the legislature (Knesset) take place every four years. Every party declares a
list of its candidates, but voters vote for the party 和 not for the candidates.
A party gets seats in the legislature in proportion to the votes polled by it.
This allows even smaller parties with very small support base to get
representation in the legislature. (A party must get a minimum of 3.25%
votes to be eligible to get seats in the legislature.) This often leads to a
multi-party coalition government.
The following table shows the result of the 2015 elections to the Knesset.
Based on this, you can find out what percentage of seats various parties got
in that election.

on a limited scale for indirect elections. The Constitution prescribes  
a third 和 complex variation of the PR system for the election of  
President, Vice President, 和 for the election to the Rajya Sabha  
and Vidhan Parishads.

How does PR work in Rajya Sabha elections
A third variant of PR, the Single Transferable Vote system
(STV), is followed for Rajya Sabha elections. Every State
has a specific quota of seats in the Rajya Sabha. The
members are elected by the respective State legislative
assemblies. The voters are the MLAs in that State. Every
voter is required to rank candidates according to her or
his preference. To be declared the winner, a candidate
must secure a minimum quota of votes, which is
determined by a formula:



 
 
 



Total votes p olled
+ 1
Total num ber of candid ates to be elected + 1



For example if 4 Rajya Sabha members have to be
elected by the 200 MLAs in Rajasthan, the winner would
require (200/4+1= 40+1) 41 votes. When the votes are
counted it is done on the basis of first preference votes
secured by each candidate, of which the candidate has
secured the first preference votes. If after the counting of
all first preference votes, required number of candidates
fail to fulfil the quota, the candidate who secured the
lowest votes of first preference is eliminated 和 his/her
votes are transferred to those who are mentioned as
second preference on those ballot papers. This process
continues till the required number of candidates are
declared elected.



Why did India adopt the FPTP system?
The answer is not very difficult to guess. If you have carefully read
the box explaining the Rajya Sabha elections, you would have noticed
that it is a complicated system which may work in a small country,
but would be difficult to work in a sub-continental country like India.
The reason for the popularity 和 success of the FPTP system is its
simplicity. The entire election system is extremely simple to
understand even for common voters who may have no specialised


 61


Chapter 3: Election 和 Representation



knowledge about politics 和 elections. There is also a clear choice
presented to the voters at the time of elections. Voters have to simply
endorse a candidate or a party while voting. Depending on the nature
of actual politics, voters may either give greater importance to the
party or to the candidate or balance the two. The FPTP system offers
voters a choice not simply between parties but specific candidates.
In other electoral systems, especially PR systems, voters are often
asked to choose a party 和 the representatives are elected on the
basis of party lists. As a result, there is no one representative who
represents 和 is responsible for one locality. In constituency based
system like the FPTP, the voters know who their own representative
is 和 can hold him or her accountable.



More importantly, the makers of our Constitution also felt that
PR based election may not be suitable for giving a stable government
in a parliamentary system. We shall study the nature of parliamentary
system of executive in the next chapter. This system requires that
the executive has majority in the legislature. You will notice that the
PR system may not produce a clear majority because seats in the
legislature would be divided on the basis of share of votes. The FPTP

 62

system generally gives the largest party or coalition some extra bonus seats, more than their share of votes would allow. Thus this system makes it possible for parliamentary 政府 to function smoothly and effectively by facilitating the formation of a stable government.
Finally, the FPTP system encourages voters from different social
groups to come together to win an election in a locality. In a diverse
country like India, a PR system would encourage each community
to form its own nation-wide party. This may also have been at the
back of the mind of our constitution makers.
The experience of the working of the Constitution has confirmed
the expectation of the constitution makers. The FPTP system has
proved to be simple 和 familiar to ordinary voters. It has helped
larger parties to win clear majorities at the centre 和 the State level.
The system has also discouraged political parties that get all their

votes only from one caste or community. Normally, the working of  
the FPTP system results in a two-party system. This means that  
there are two major competitors for power 和 power is often shared  
by these two parties alternately. It is difficult for new parties or the  
third party to enter the competition 和 share power. In this respect,  
the experience of FPTP in India is slightly different. After  
independence, though we adopted the FPTP system, there emerged  
a one party dominance 和 along with it, there existed many smaller  
parties. After 1989, India is witnessing the functioning of the multi-  
party coalitions. At the same time, gradually, in many States, a two-  
party competition is emerging. But the distinguishing feature of  
India’s party system is that the rise of coalitions has made it possible  
for new 和 smaller parties to enter into electoral competition in spite  
of the FPTP system.

 RESERVA TION OF CONSTITUENCIES

We have noticed that in the FPTP election system, the candidate who  
secures the highest votes in a particular constituency is declared  
elected. This often works to the disadvantage of the smaller social  
groups. This is even more significant in the Indian social context. We  
have had a history of caste-based discrimination. In such a social  
system, the FPTP electoral system can mean that the dominant social  
groups 和 castes can win everywhere 和 the oppressed social  
groups may continue to remain unrepresented. Our Constitution  
makers were aware of this difficulty 和 the need to provide a way to  
ensure fair 和 just representation to the oppressed social groups.  
This issue was debated even before independence 和 the British  
government had introduced ‘separate electorates’. This system meant


Tajamul Husain, CAD, Vol. VIII, p. 333, 26 May 1949



“Separate electorates have been a curse to India, have
done incalculable harm to this country... Separate
electorates have barred our progress... We (Muslims)
want to merge in the nation. ...for God’s sake keep
your hands off reservation for the Muslim
community.”


 64


Indian Constitution at Work



that for electing a representative from a particular community, only
those voters would be eligible who belong to that community. In the
Constituent Assembly, many members expressed a fear that this
will not suit our purposes. Therefore, it was decided to adopt the
system of reserved constituencies. In this system, all voters in a
constituency are eligible to vote but the candidates must belong to
only a particular community or social section for which the seat is
reserved.
There are certain social groups which may be spread across the
country. In a particular constituency, their numbers may not be
sufficient to be able to influence a victory of a candidate. However,
taken across the country they are a significantly sizeable group. To
ensure their proper representation, a system of reservation becomes
necessary. The Constitution provides for reservation of seats in the
Lok Sabha 和 State Legislative Assemblies for the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes. This provision was made initially for a period
of 10 years 和 as a result of successive constitutional [[amendments]],
has been extended up to 2020. The Parliament can take a decision
to further extend it, when the period of reservation expires. The
number of seats reserved for both of these groups is in proportion to
their share in the population of India. Of the 543 elected seats in the
Lok Sabha, 84 are reserved for Scheduled Castes 和 47 are reserved
for Scheduled Tribes (as on 26 January 2019).



“...But I have come to say a few words on behalf of the
Adivasis of India.... In the past, thanks to the major
political parties, thanks to the British 政府 and
thanks to every enlightened Indian citizen, we have been
isolated 和 kept, as it were, in a zoo. ...We are willing to
mix with you, 和 it is for that reason, ..., that we have
insisted on a reservation of seats as far as the Legislatures
are concerned. We have not asked ...(for) separate
electorates; ...Under the 1935 Act, throughout the
Legislatures in India, there were altogether only 24
Adivasi MLAs out of a total of 1585, ...and not a single
representative at the Centre.”
Jaipal Singh, CAD, Vol. V, pp. 209-210, 27 August 1947


 65



Who decides which constituency is to be reserved? On what basis  
is this decision taken? This decision is taken by an independent  
body called the Delimitation Commission. The Delimitation  
Commission is appointed by the President of India 和 works in  
collaboration with the Election Commission of India. It is appointed for  
the purpose of drawing up the boundaries of constituencies all over the  
country. A quota of constituencies to be reserved in each State is fixed  
depending on the proportion of SC or ST in that State. After drawing  
the boundaries, the Delimitation Commission looks at the composition  
of population in each constituency. Those constituencies that have the  
highest proportion of Scheduled Tribe population are reserved for ST.  
In the case of Scheduled Castes, the Delimitation Commission looks at  
two things. It picks constituencies that have higher proportion of  
Scheduled Caste population. But it also spreads these constituencies  
in different regions of the State. This is done because the Scheduled  
Caste population is generally spread evenly throughout the country.  
These reserved constituencies can be rotated each time the  
Delimitation exercise is undertaken.  
The Constitution does not make similar reservation for other  
disadvantaged groups. Of late there has been a strong demand  
seeking reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha 和 State Assemblies  
for women. Given the fact that very few women are elected to  
representative bodies, the demand for reserving one-third seats for  
women is increasingly being articulated. Reservation of seats for  
[[women]] has been provided for in rural 和 urban local bodies. We  
shall discuss this in the chapter on Local Governments. A similar  
provision for Lok Sabha 和 Vidhan Sabhas would require an  
amendment to the Constitution. Such an amendment has been  
proposed several times in the Parliament but has not yet been passed.

 FREE 和 FAIR ELECTIONS

The true test of any election system is its ability to ensure a free 和  
fair electoral process. If we want democracy to be translated into  
reality on the ground, it is important that the election system is  
impartial 和 transparent. The system of election must also allow  
the aspirations of the voter to find legitimate expression through the  
electoral results.

Indian Constitution at Work



Universal franchise 和 right to contest
Apart from laying down a method of elections, the
Constitution answers two basic questions about elections:
Who are the voters? Who can contest elections? In both
these respects our Constitution follows the well established
democratic practices.
You already know that democratic elections require
that all adult citizens of the country must be eligible to
vote in the elections. This is known as universal adult
franchise. In many countries, citizens had to fight long
battles with the rulers to get this right. In many countries,
women could get this right very late 和 only after
struggle. One of the important decisions of the framers of
the Indian Constitution was to guarantee every adult
citizen in India, the right to vote.
Till 1989, an adult Indian meant an Indian citizen
above the age of 21. An amendment to the Constitution
in 1989, reduced the eligibility age to 18. Adult franchise
ensures that all citizens are able to participate in the

The proportion of Muslims in the population of India
is about 14.2 per cent. But the number of Muslim
MPs in the Lok Sabha has usually been less than 6
per cent, less than half of their share in population. A
similar situation prevails in most State Assemblies.
Three students drew different conclusions from this
fact. Write down whether 和 why you agree or
disagree with each of them.
Hilal: This demonstrates the unfairness of the
FPTP system. We should have opted for PR system.
Arif: This shows the wisdom of granting
reservations to SC 和 ST. What is needed is a
reservation of seats for Muslims on the same lines as
for SC 和 ST.
Saba: There is no point in talking about Muslims
as a whole. Muslim women are not going to get any
share in any of these systems. We need a separate
quota for Muslim women.

process of selecting their representative. This is consistent with the  
principle of equality 和 non-discrimination that we studied in the  
chapter on rights. Many people thought 和 many think so today  
that giving the right to vote to  
everyone irrespective of  
educational qualification was not  
right. But our Constitution  
makers had a firm belief in the  
ability 和 worth of all adult  
citizens as equals in the matter  
of deciding what is good for the  
society, the country 和 for their  
own constituencies.  
What is true of the right to  
vote is also true of right to contest  
election. All citizens have the right  
to stand for election 和 become  
the representative of the people.  
However, there are different  
minimum age requirements for  
contesting elections. For example,  
in order to stand for Lok Sabha  
or Assembly election, a candidate  
must be at least 25 years old.  
There are some other restrictions  
also. For instance, there is a legal  
provision that a person who has  
undergone imprisonment for two  
or more years for some offence is  
disqualified from contesting  
elections. But there are no  
restrictions of income, education  
or class or gender on the right to  
contest elections. In this sense,  
our system of election is open to  
all citizens.

election system 和 process. The most important among these is the

Indian Constitution at Work



creation of an independent Election Commission to ‘supervise and
conduct’ elections. Do you know that in many countries, there is an
absence of an independent mechanism for conducting elections?



Article 324 of the Indian Constitution provides for an independent
Election Commission for the ‘superintendence, direction 和 control
of the electoral roll 和 the conduct of elections’ in India. These words
in the Constitution are very important, for they give the Election
Commission a decisive role in virtually everything to do with elections.
The Supreme Court has agreed with this interpretation of the
Constitution.
To assist the Election Commission of India there is a Chief Electoral
Officer in every state. The Election Commission is not responsible for
the conduct of local body elections. As we shall study in the chapter
on Local Government, the State Election Commissioners work
independently of the Election Commission of India 和 each has its
own sphere of operation.
The Election Commission of India can either be a single member
or a multi-member body. Till 1989, the Election Commission was
single member. Just before the 1989 general elections, two Election
Commissioners were appointed, making the body multi-member.
Soon after the elections, the Commission reverted to its single member
status. In 1993, two Election Commissioners were once again
appointed 和 the Commission became multi-member 和 has
remained multi-member since then. Initially there were many
apprehensions about a multi-member Commission. There was a
sharp difference of opinion between the then Chief Election



Article 324: (1)
The superintendence, direction 和 control of
the preparation of the electoral rolls for, and
the conduct of, all elections to Parliament and
to the Legislature of every State 和 of

President held under this Constitution shall
be vested in a Commission (referred to in this
Constitution as the Election Commission).

Commissioner 和 the other Commissioners about who  
had how much power. The matter had to be settled by the  
Supreme Court. Now there is a general consensus that a  
multi-member Election Commission is more appropriate  
as power is shared 和 there is greater accountability.  
The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) presides over  
the Election Commission, but does not have more powers  
than the other Election Commissioners. The CEC 和 the  
two Election Commissioners have equal powers to take  
all decisions relating to elections as a collective body. They  
are appointed by the President of India on the advice of  
the Council of Ministers. It is therefore possible for a ruling  
party to appoint a partisan person to the Commission  
who might favour them in the elections. This fear has led  
many to suggest that this procedure should be changed.  
Many persons have suggested that a different method  
should be followed that makes consultation with the leader  
of opposition 和 the Chief Justice of India necessary for  
the appointment of CEC 和 Election Commissioners.  
The Constitution ensures the security of the tenure of  
the CEC 和 Election Commissioners. They are appointed  
for a six year term or continue till the age of 65, whichever  
is earlier. The CEC can be removed before the expiry of

Special majority
Special majority means:
± Two-thirds majority of those present 和 voting, and
± Simple majority of the total membership of the House.
Let us say that you have to pass a resolution in your class
with a special majority. Imagine further that your class has a total
student strength of 57. But on the day of voting, only 51 students
are present 和 50 students participated in voting. When would
you say that the resolution has been passed with ‘special majority’
in this situation?
In this book you will find mention of ‘special majority’ in at
least three other chapters. One is in the next chapter on Executive,
where we discuss the impeachment of the President of India. Find
out the other two places where special majority is discussed.

the term, by the President if both Houses of Parliament make such a
recommendation with a special majority. This is done to ensure that
a ruling party cannot remove a CEC who refuses to favour it in
elections. The Election Commissioners can be removed by the
President of India.
The Election Commission of India has a wide range of functions.
± It supervises the preparation of up-to-date voters’ list. It makes
every effort to ensure that the voters’ list is free of errors like non-
existence of names of registered voters or existence of names of
those non-eligible or non-existent.
± It also determines the timing of elections 和 prepares the election
schedule. The election schedule includes the notification of
elections, date from which nominations can be filed, last date for
filing nominations, last date of scrutiny, last date of withdrawal,
date of polling 和 date of counting 和 declaration of results.
± During this entire process, the Election Commission has the power
to take decisions to ensure a free 和 fair poll. It can postpone or
cancel the election in the entire country or a specific State or
constituency on the grounds that the atmosphere is vitiated and
therefore, a free 和 fair election may not be possible. The
Commission also implements a model code of conduct for parties
and candidates. It can order a re-poll in a specific constituency.
It can also order a recount of votes when it feels that the counting
process has not been fully fair 和 just.
± The Election Commission accords recognition to political parties
and allots symbols to each of them.
The Election Commission has very limited staff of its own. It
conducts the elections with the help of the administrative machinery.
However, once the election process has begun, the commission has
control over the administration as far as election related work is
concerned. During the election process, the administrative officers of
the State 和 central governments are assigned election related duty
and in this respect, the Election Commission has full control over
them. The EC can transfer the officers, or stop their transfers; it can
take action against them for failing to act in a non-partisan manner.
Over the years, the Election Commission of India has emerged as
an independent authority which has asserted its powers to ensure
fairness in the election process. It has acted in an impartial and
unbiased manner in order to protect the sanctity of the electoral
process. The record of Election Commission also shows that every


 71



improvement in the functioning of institutions does not require legal  
or constitutional change. It is widely agreed that the Election  
Commission is more independent 和 assertive now than it was till  
25 years ago. This is not because the powers 和 constitutional  
protection of the Election Commission have increased. The Election  
Commission has started using more effectively the powers it always  
had in the Constitution.  
Since 1951–52, seventeen  
Lok Sabha elections have been  
held. Many more State assembly  
elections 和 by-elections have  
been conducted by the Election  
Commission. The EC has faced  
many difficult situations such as  
holding elections in militancy  
affected areas like Assam,  
Punjab or Jammu 和 Kashmir.  
It has also faced the difficult  
situation of having to postpone  
the election process mid-way in  
1991 when the ex-Prime Minister  
Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated  
during campaigning. In 2002,  
the Election Commission faced  
another critical situation when  
the Gujarat Assembly was  
dissolved 和 elections had to be  
conducted. But the Election  
Commission found that  
unprecedented violence in  
that State had made it  
impossible to hold free 和 fair  
elections immediately. The  
Election Commission decided  
to postpone elections to the  
State Assembly by a few  
months. The Supreme Court  
upheld this decision of the  
Election Commission.

 ELECTORAL REFORMS


No system of election can ever be perfect. 和 in actual
election process, there are bound to be many flaws and
limitations. Any democratic society has to keep searching
for mechanisms to make elections free 和 fair to the
maximum. With the acceptance of adult suffrage, freedom
to contest elections, 和 the establishment of an
independent Election Commission, India has tried to make
its election process free 和 fair. However, the experience
of the past 66 years has given rise to many suggestions
for reforming our election system. The Election
Commission, political parties, various independent
groups, 和 many scholars have come up with proposals
for electoral reform. Some of these suggestions are about
changing the constitutional provisions discussed in this
Chapter:
± Our system of elections should be changed from the
FPTP to some variant of the PR system. This would


 73



ensure that parties get seats, as far as possible, in proportion to  
the votes they get.  
± There should be a special provision to ensure that at least one-  
third women are elected to the parliament 和 assemblies.  
± There should be stricter provisions to control the role of money  
in electoral politics. The  
elections expenses should  
be paid by the 政府  
out of a special fund.  
± Candidates with any  
criminal case should be  
barred from contesting  
elections, even if their  
appeal is pending before a  
court.  
± There should be complete  
ban on the use of caste 和  
religious appeals in the  
campaign.  
± There should be a law to  
regulate the functioning of  
political parties 和 to  
ensure that they function in  
a transparent 和  
democratic manner.  
These are but a few  
suggestions. There is no  
consensus about these  
suggestions. Even if there was  
a consensus, there are limits to  
what the laws 和 formal  
provisions can do. Free 和 fair  
elections can be held only if the  
candidates, the parties 和  
those involved in the election  
process agree to abide by the  
spirit of democratic competition.  
Apart from legal reforms, there are two other ways of ensuring  
that elections reflect the expectations 和 democratic aspirations of  
the people. One is, of course, that people themselves have to be more

vigilant, more actively involved in political activities. But there are
limits to the extent to which ordinary people can engage in politics
on a regular basis. Therefore, it is necessary that various political
institutions 和 voluntary organisations are developed 和 are active
in functioning as watchdog for ensuring free 和 fair elections.



Conclusion
In countries where representative democracy is practiced,
elections 和 the representative character of those elections
are crucial factors in making democracy effective and
trustworthy. The success of India’s election system can be
gauged from a number of factors.
± Our election system has allowed the voters not only to freely
choose representatives, but also to change governments
peacefully both at the State 和 national level.
± Secondly, voters have consistently taken a keen interest in
the election process 和 participated in it. The number of
candidates 和 parties that contest elections is on the rise.
± Thirdly, the system of election has proved to be
accommodative 和 inclusive. The social composition of our
representatives has changed gradually. Now our representatives
come from many different social sections, though the number
of women legislators has not increased satisfactorily.
± Fourthly, the election outcome in most parts of the country
does not reflect electoral malpractices 和 rigging. Of course,
many attempts at rigging do take place. You must have read
about violence, about complaints that voters’ names disappear
from the voters’ list, about intimidation, 和 so on. Yet, such
instances rarely directly affect the outcome of the election.
± Finally 和 most importantly, elections have become a part
and parcel of our democratic life. No one can imagine a situation
where a 政府 would disrespect the verdict of an election.
Similarly, no one can imagine that a 政府 would be
formed without holding elections. In fact, regularity and
periodicity of elections has earned fame for India as a great
democratic experiment.


 75




All these factors have earned for our election system a
respect within 和 outside the country. The voter in India has
gained confidence. The legitimacy of the Election Commission
has increased in the eyes of the people. This vindicates the
basic decisions taken by our Constitution makers. If the election
process becomes more flawless, we as voters 和 citizens would
be able to share more effectively in this carnival of democracy
and make it more meaningful.
