reading comprehension

what is objective behind given a particular passage & how do you get confused?
a most common issue is that you can understand passage but not be able to relate with options provided.
there are 3 ways to answer:
make assumptions:
such answers are not supported by any evidence from passage.
here you should highlight possibilities.
draw inferences:
here do not assume anything.
there should be solid evidence for answer you are choosing.
arguments:
it has 2 connotations
positive or 
negative
reading can be divided into 3 parts:
pre-reading:
here we made a call whether we know passage or not.
it's very important as it helps in finding how far you can relate to topic.
during reading:
it's most important part as a lot of time is invested in it.
post-reading:
it's part where we are actually answering questions.
what is difference b/w reading & comprehending?
reading:
it means a particular person is familiar with alphabets & as a result, he can read sentences.
comprehending:
it means whether you can decode meaning.
are you able to understand objective with which author is writing?
if you are comprehending that you will be able to frame ideology in your mind.
this ideology should be converted into action.
if ideology is derived properly then arriving at action becomes easy.
why answers become incorrect even after understanding context?
experiences & observations of author may differ from experiences & observations of reader.
content has varied contexts.
eg. author may be talking about fruit apple while reader took it as brand apple.
cap idea of reading comprehension:
c: conclusion
a: assumption
p: premises
options form premises, we assume based on these & then arrive at conclusion i.e answers.
eg. south korean ambulance helicopters are crashing on regular basis.
now if you have already known about it, you will stick to what you already know rather than focus on context of question.
while drawing conclusions kindly make sure that your assumptions should not be based on prior knowledge.
you should stick to context provided by author.
octave:
o: opinion
c: contrasting ideas
t: tone
a: avoid superlatives
v: verify your answers
e: eliminate wrong options
opinion is mindset of author.
contrasting idea means that particular part of passage where you find that whatever ideology you have is not matching with ideology of author.
eg. you are able to understand 1 paragraph but you missed his context in another paragraph.
tone in written format has to be picked from words.
a number of mistakes are due to misinterpretation of tone.
comprehending tone is a major challenge.
more sensitive author gets more progressive or regressive tone he is going to use.
tone of author & answer should be same.
superlatives should be avoided.
many times author is not claiming that his idea is only way.
never try to pick options that are highly superlative in characters.
answer should also be verified. there are certain grounds that verify your answer.
always choose best option, not second-best.
regression:
it means that you are re-reading paragraphs, questions, & options.
it's time-consuming.
basic ideology behind regression is that you are not able to establish relation b/w variables.
it means that you are not able to understand passage.
it may happen when passage is new to you.
you are not able to relate sentences & paragraphs.
jargon/terms may be so difficult that you are not able to comprehend them.
ideas of dual thinking:
stage 1:
whether you are having comfort or whether you score.
stage 2:
you are framing ideas while reading.
these ideas are about understanding, accuracy, time limit, etc.
stage 3:
it takes place while answering.
here you are re-reading.
solutions:
eye & mind coordination:
when author is writing he is using his mind.
he is writing with objective of communicating his ideas.
when a reader reads he reads with his eyes.
his objective is to score.
but here as a reader, we should also read with our mind.
we should push our eyes faster to another word to read fast.
even if you don't understand a line, don't re-read it.
manageable reading section:
in subject, you already know how many lines you can understand without re-reading them.
this is c/a manageable reading section.
to avoid regression, mark anchor word in a particular group of lines.
margin word can be written.
scanning & skimming:
at first, read as fast as possible.
it will give you a general idea.
when you read that passage again you will get idea that from where question can come from.
keywords:
in 2nd reading look for keywords & ideas/opinions.
in key words you can look for:
positive words
negative words
exs etc.
facts & opinions:
strike off general facts.
by this, you won't be spending time re-reading them.
slow thoughtful reading:
if theme of subject is new for you there you need to go slow.
but you should be mindful at same time.
drill down approach:
it means
depth
connect 
maturity
options should be as per theme used by author.
a stronger theme requires strong options as answers.
same goes with maturity.
mode of options:
extreme words like only, always, never, everywhere, every time, etc.
these extreme words claim a particular choice which is 100%.
no deviation is there
scope trap:
options that are very convincing but wrong.
entire line will be from a passage except for a word.
mismatch:
here statement is partially correct & partially incorrect.
single fact focus:
it means exclusive question.
question is exclusive to a single problem.
your solution should also correspond to this.
acc to passage & acc to author:
passage contains general facts as well as opinions of author.
when question asks 'acc to author' 1st priority should be given to opinion of author.
facts should be considered in 'acc to passage'.
scoring technique:
it's helpful when all options are correct.
analyze options & chose closest answer.
