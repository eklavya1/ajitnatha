Railway Protection Force (RPF) is one of the security forces of India.
It is tasked with protecting the property and passengers of the Indian Railways.
RPF has been saving lives in mission mode under "Mission Jeewan Raksha". RPF personnel have saved 1650 lives from the wheels of running trains at railway stations in the last four years under this mission.
An initiative "Meri Saheli" was launched to provide security to lady passengers in long-distance trains particularly travelling alone or those who are vulnerable to crime.
During the year 2021, RPF retrieved left behind luggage having value to the tune of more than 23 Crores belonging to 12377 passengers and retumed to them after due verification. RPF has been doing this service to passengers under *operation Amanat*.
