**********************
- Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, manoseṭṭhā manomayā;  
- Manasā ce paduṭṭhena, bhāsati vā karoti vā;  
- Tato nam dukkhaṁ anveti, cakkaṁ'va vahato padaṁ.

- Mind precedes all mental [[state]]. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts [[suffering]] follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.  
	_(Translated by Acharya Buddharakkhita)_
