- Demand deposits or non-confidential money are funds held in demand accounts in commercial banks. These account balances are usually considered [[money]] and form the greater part of the narrowly defined money supply of a country. Simply put, these are deposits in the bank that can be withdrawn on demand, without any prior notice.
