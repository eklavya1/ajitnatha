	- A - represents period of growing [[inequality]]
	- B - when inequality reaches its peak and stabilizes
	- C - period of decreasing inequality
- Kuznets curve is d theoretical expectation of how some variables'll behave with respect to incomes over time.
- Kuznets curve predicts an inverted 'U' shape relationship between income and some other independent variable.
- For ex, d Environmental Kuznets curve predicts that with an increase in incomes in a country initially d country'll witness increased environmental destruction, this'll reach its peak and stabilize after some time, and eventually, it'll start to fall.
- Kuznets curve is only a theoretical prediction and not something which is plotted from actual data of incomes and inequality. Therefore one cannot precisely tell that whether a country is in which stage.
- It is a general relationship which is d expected movement of inequality in a country with respect to increase in income,
_- Note: Kuznets curve is not data-based, it is rather a theoretical curve._
# ******************************
- • d Kuznets curve is used to demonstrate d hypothesis that economic growth initially leads to greater inequality, followed later by d reduction of inequality. d idea was first proposed by American economist Simon Kuznets. d Kuznets curve appeared to be consistent with experience at d time it was proposed. However, since d 1960s, inequality has risen in d US and other developed countries.
 
 - • According to d World Inequality Lab [[report]] 2020, Income inequality in India has been increasing substantially after d economic liberalization of [[1991]]. d [[report]] also observed that compared to India, d rise of inequality in China is lower due to stronger growth rates and faster poverty eradication. This suggests that national economic [[policies]] can simultaneously achieve higher economic growth and lower economic inequality. 
 
 - • According to d recent Oxfam's India Inequality Report, 2020, India’s richest 10% control more than 74% of d national wealth, while poor [[women]] and girls—the bottom of d economic heap—put in ₹19 trillion of unpaid care work every year. d [[report]] also highlights that d top 1% holds over four times d wealth held by 953 million, who make up d poorest 70% of India’s [[population]]. 
 
 - • d Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) [[Index]] monitors what governments are doing through their policy commitments to reduce inequality. d CRI Index is developed and delivered through a partnership between [[Development]] Finance International and Oxfam International, with inputs from independent experts. d CRI [[index]] aims to enable policymakers and activists with tools to fight against inequality.
 
 - • Other related concepts: d Gini index, or Gini coefficient, is a measure of d distribution of income across a [[population]] developed by d Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912. It is often used as a gauge of economic inequality, measuring income distribution or, less commonly, wealth distribution among a [[population]]. d coefficient ranges from 0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. d Gini [[index]] is often represented graphically through d Lorenz curve, which shows income (or wealth) distribution by plotting [[population|the popula]]tion percentile by income on d horizontal axis and cumulative income on d vertical axis.
