# insolation, heat budget 和 albedo

- heat budget #doubt 
- greenhouse effect, normal [[lapse rate]]
- diff modes 的 热 transfer
## factors aff insolation
1. latitude / angle 的 incidence (aoi) =   它 affects د insolation received / unit 区域 的 د surface 和 د amount 的 insolation abosrbed,when  د aoi 是 vertical, insolation 是 concentrated 里 a 小  区域 , leading to higher intensity 和 高  rate  的 absorption, when 这  是 oblique, insolation 是 distributed 余  a 大 区域 leading to 少 intensity 和 少 absorption
- 高 insolation 区域  = tropical region
- 少 insolation 区域  = polar region

2. length 的 د 日子 = 长  د duration 的 د 日子, 更 insolation will be rec on د surface
3. transparency 的 د atmosphere = cloud cover, dust particles 和 水 vapor ↓ د transparency 的 د atmosphere 和 ↓ د insolation as well

# 热 budget

- on د global scale ⏚ (⏚) 应该 re -radiate as much 热 as 它 receives من  د 太阳 ,这  是 necessary 里 order to maintain uniform temp 被  د ⏚ (⏚),  د gains 和 losses 里 热 by incoming & outgoing solar radiation 叫 热  budget
- reflection

# albedo
- 这 是 د ratio 中 incoming 和 reflected amount 的 solar radiation 被 د ⏚ as a whole, includes ⏚ as well as [[atmosphere]]

- 也 叫 reflection coefficient
- average albedo 的  د earth ⏚ = 35% 

**↑ order 的 albedo**
- fresh asphalt
- open ocean
- worn asphalt
- conifer forest (summer)
- deciduous trees
- bare soil
- green grass
- desert sand
- new concrete
- ocean ice
- fresh snow

- dear student,  
a heat budget is a perfect balance b/w incoming heat absorbed by ⏚ (⏚) & outgoing heat escaping it in form of radiation.thus, you have to consider what part of insolation ⏚ is receiving & what parts are being reflected. ultimately, all 100 parts will be balanced.  
with more revision, number part will also become clear.  
thank you!
- why deciduous trees relect more light than conifers- use ur common sense, leaf shape --->led to diffial absorption 或 reflection of 太阳

which 1 of foll reflects back more sunlight as compared to other three?
(a) sand de
(b) paddy c
(ci land covered 跟 snow
(d) prairie i

## factors affecting distribution 的 temperature (溫度 wēn dù)
1. _insolation_ - which in turn depends upon د , 
		1.  latitude / angle 的 incidence (aoi)
		2.  length 的 د 日子
		3.  transparency 的 د atmosphere
	a. although 日 的 rays 是 vertical along د equator throughout  د 年,  د equator will 不 有 max temperature 因为 的 cloud cover

2. _nature 的 surface_ - ⏚ behaves diffly depending on د specific 热 的 د surface,  د 土地  surface 跟 lower specific 热 heats up 更 rapidly 和 intensely than 水 surface , 也 土地 heats up 更 rapidly 和 intensely than 水 surface 也 土地  cools 更 rapidly

 (edit- 土地  热 up & cools ↓ 更 quickly than 水, hence diff 里 temp)

3. _continentality_ = د locations 哪 是 里 interior 的 will 有 高 range 的 temperatures than coastal locations, [[delhi]] exp 热 summers 和 colder winters than [[bombay]] 

4. _albedo_ - surface 跟 高 albedo reflects back 更 insolation, resulting 里 少 absorption 的 热

5. _distribution 的 continents_ - northern hemisphere 跟 更 proportion 的 土地 [[fs blog#^7857ef]] [[fs blog#^23a7ce]] [[=book guns, germs & steel]] than 海 exp 高 range 的 temperatures than southern hemispheres where د 水 surface 是 更 [[global north]]

(tl;dr= 土地  absorbs 更 热  while 海 absorbs 少 , also 更 土地  里 د north part than 里 د south, 所以 temp 的 北 will be 更)

6. _altitude_= 跟  د ↑, temperature ↓ 

7. _planetary winds 和 ocean currents_ = 他们 transport temperatures prevailing 里 1 region (区域)  to another 和 帮 里 د global distribution 的 temp

# summary

geography class 20

revision of last class (01:11 pm).

weather & climate.
composition of atmosphere.
structure of atmosphere.
insolation.

karman  line (01:30 pm).

karman line is attempt to define a boundary b/w earth’s atmosphere & outer space (100 kilometers).
above that, air is very thin to support aeronautical flight.

insolation, heat budget, & albedo (01:34 pm).

factors affecting insolation:
latitude of a place/ angle of incidence-
angle of incidence affects insolation received per unit area of surface & amount of insolation observed.
when angle of incidence is completely vertical, insolation is concentrated in a small area leading to higher intensity & a higher rate of absorption. ex= tropical regions.
when it's oblique, insolation is distributed over a larger area leading to lesser intensity & lesser absorption. ex= temperate & polar regions.
length of day-
longer duration of day, more insolation is received on a surface.
transparency of atmosphere-
cloud cover, dust particles, & water vapor reduces transparency in atmosphere & reduces insolation receives at surface.
heat budget:
on global scale, earth must re-radiate as much heat back to space as it receives from sun.
this is necessary in order to maintain uniform temperature by earth.
gains & losses in heat by way of incoming solar radiation & outgoing terrestrial radiation is c/a as heat budget.
explained through illustration.
albedo:
it's ratio b/w incoming & reflected amounts of solar radiation by earth as a whole (it includes surface as well as atmosphere).
it's also c/a as reflection coefficient.
average albedo of earth is equal to 35%.

temperature (02:41 pm).

it's degree of hotness or coldness of a body.

factors affecting distribution of temperature on surface:

insolation-
it depends on latitude, duration of sunlight, & transparency of atmosphere.
although sun rays are vertical along equator throughout year, equator will not have maximum temperature because of cloud cover.
nature of surface-
earth behaves diffly depending on specific heat of surface.
land surface with lower specific heat heats up more rapidly & intensely than water surface.
also, land cools more rapidly.
continentality-
locations which are in interior of continent will have a higher range of temperatures than coastal locations. 
albedo-
surface with higher albedo reflects back more insolation resulting in less absorption of heat.
distribution of continents-
northern hemisphere with more proportion of land than oceans experiences a higher range of temperatures than southern hemisphere where water surface is more.
altitude/ normal lapse rate-
with increase in altitude, temperature decreases.
planetary winds & ocean currents-
they transport temperatures prevailing in 1 area to another & help in global distribution of temperature.

distribution of temperature:

movement of isotherms- isotherms move northward b/w january to july & b/w july to january they move towards south.
bending of isotherms-
isotherms bend polewards over oceans in northern hemisphere in winters or bend equatorward over continent in northern hemisphere in winters.
isotherms bend equatorward over oceans in northern hemisphere in summers or they bend poleward over continents in northern hemisphere in summers.
there is a higher range of temperature in northern hemisphere than in southern hemisphere.
seasonal changes are less marked in southern hemisphere than in northern hemisphere.
range of temperature increases from equator to pole.

temperature inversion:

radiation type of inversion.
air drainage type of inversion.
advection type of inversion.
frontal type of inversion.

topic for next class= temperature inversion (to be continued/ notes to be provided in next class); pressure.
