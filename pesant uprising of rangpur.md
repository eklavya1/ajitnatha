# Peasant Uprising of Rangpur, Bengal, 1783
The establishment of British control over Bengal after 1757 and their various land revenue experiments in Bengal to extract as much as possible from peasants brought unbearable hardship for the common man.
Rangpur and Dinajpur were two of the districts of Bengal which faced all kinds of illegal demands by the East India Company and its revenue contractors.
The harsh attitude of the revenue contractors and their exactions became a regular feature of peasant life.
One such revenue contractor was Debi Singh of Rangpur and Dinajpur.
He and his agents created a reign of terror in the two districts of northern Bengal.
Taxes on the Zamindars were increased which were passed on from Zamindars to cultivators or ryots.
Ryots were not in a position to meet the growing demands of Debi Singh and his agents.
Debi Singh and his men used to beat and flog the peasants, burn their houses and destroy their crops and not even women were spared.
Peasants appealed to the company officials to redress their grievances. Their appeal however remained unheeded.
Being deprived of justice the peasants took the law into their own hands.
By beat of a drum, the rebel peasants gathered a large number of peasants, armed with swords, shields, bows, and arrows.
They elected Dirjinarain as their leader and attacked the local cutcheries and storehouses of crops of local agents of the contractors and government officials.
In many cases, they snatched away the prisoners from the government guards.
