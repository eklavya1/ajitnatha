it's ratio b/w total population & total cultivated area of a particular place.
this is expressed as a person per square kilometer of cultivated land.
this measure of density is useful  b/c it cn give us a rough estimate of how many people area of farmland cn reasonably support.
it's also helpful when studying population pressure & overcrowding.
population pressure is total of all factors, like increase in population, which reduces ability of a geographic area to support inhabitants.
productivity of land is also a factor in studying physiological density of area. [[mansabdari system]]
higher physiological density is, more pressure people put on land to produce enough food to survive.
it also suggests that available agricultural land is being used by more people, & it may reach its output limit sooner than a country that has a lower physiological density.
