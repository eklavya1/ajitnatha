it was 1 of major schools of art in history of ancient india.
although being intricate part of indian history, it's uniquely associated with greco- roman style of art.
it was a combination of hellenistic, west asiatic, & native elements. 
combination of these greco-roman & indian ideas along with influence of other foreign traditions such as from china & iran resulted in formation of a distinct style k/a gandhara school of art.
this style of art was closely associated with mahayana buddhism & hence main theme of this art was lord buddha & bodhisattvas.
thus, it cn be conjectured that in idea & conception this style was indian & in execution it was foreign.
one ex of gandhara style of art is bamiyan buddha statues.
it mostly flourished in areas of afghanistan & present north-western india..
prominent locations were taxila, peshawar, begram, & bamiyan.
period around which gandhara school of art flourished could be said to be from 1st century bce to 4th century ce.
early gandhara school used bluish-grey sandstone while later period saw use of mud & stucco.
striking feature of gandhara school of art shows a very realistic & natural depiction of features in perfection. although it was dominated by themes of lord buddha, however, there were images on other subjects also made such as images of greek god apollo & certain kings as well.
