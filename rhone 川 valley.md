- The Rhône (/roʊn/ ROHN, [[French]]: [ʁon] (About this soundlisten)) is a major river in [[France]] and [[switzerland]], rising in the Alps and flowing west and south through Lake Geneva and southeastern France before discharging into the Mediterranean Sea. At Arles, near its mouth, the river divides into the Great Rhône ([[French]]: le Grand Rhône) and the Little Rhône (le Petit Rhône). The resulting delta forms the Camargue region.

- The river's source is the Rhône [[Glacier]], at the east edge of the Swiss canton of Valais. The glacier is part of the Saint-Gotthard Massif, which gives rise to three other major rivers: the Reuss, Rhine and Ticino.

- The Rhône has twice the average discharge of the longest [[French]] river, the Loire.
