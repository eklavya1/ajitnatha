- Satyagraha (; Sanskrit: सत्याग्रह; satya: "truth", āgraha: "insistence" or "holding firmly to"), or "holding firmly to truth", or "truth force", is a particular form of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance. Someone who practises satyagraha is a satyagrahi.

- The term satyagraha was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948), who practised satyagraha in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced Martin Luther King Jr.'s and James Bevel's campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, as well as Nelson Mandela's struggle against apartheid in South Africa and many other social justice and similar movements.

- The chief aspect of Gandhian ideology was Satyagraha i.e. 'true force'. For, [[Mahatma]] [[Gandhi]], Satyagraha was not merely a political tactic but part of a total [[philosophy]] of life and ideology of action.
- For Gandhi, the Satyagraha was to be used so that by self-suffering and not by violence the enemy could be converted to one's own view. [[Pattabhi Sitaramaya]] explains Satyagraha as: "It involves self-chosen [[suffering|[[sufferi]]ng]] and humiliation for the resistors. If it is effective, it is so by working on the conscience of those against whom it is being used, sapping their confidence in the exclusive rightness of their cause making their physical strength important, and weakening their resolution by insinuating a sense of guilt for the suffering they have part in causing."
- Mahtama Gandhi made a distinction between the Satyagraha and passive resistance. He wrote: " The passive resistance has been concieved as a weapon of the weak and does not exclude the use of physical force or violence for the purpose of gaining one's end; whereas the Satyagraha has been concieved as a weapon of the strongest, and excludes the use of violance in any shape.
