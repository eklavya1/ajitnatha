Sugarcane or sugar cane is a species of (often hybrid) tall, perennial grass (in the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae) that is used for sugar production. The plants are 2–6 m (6–20 ft) tall with stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. Sugarcanes belong to the grass family, Poaceae, an economically important flowering plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops. It is native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of India, Southeast Asia, and New Guinea. The plant is also grown for biofuel production, especially in Brazil, as the canes can be used directly to produce ethyl alcohol (ethanol).

Grown in tropical and subtropical regions, sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity, totaling 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020, with Brazil accounting for 40% of the world total. Sugarcane accounts for 79% of sugar produced globally (most of the rest is made from sugar beets). About 70% of the sugar produced comes from Saccharum officinarum and its hybrids. All sugarcane species can interbreed, and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.Sucrose (table sugar) is extracted from sugarcane in specialized mill factories. It is consumed directly in confectionery, used to sweeten beverages, as a preservative in jams and conserves, as a decorative finish for cakes and pâtisserie, as a raw material in the food industry, or fermented to produce ethanol. Products derived from fermentation of sugar include falernum, rum, and cachaça. In some regions, people use sugarcane reeds to make pens, mats, screens, and thatch. The young, unexpanded flower head of Saccharum edule (duruka) is eaten raw, steamed, or toasted, and prepared in various ways in Southeast Asia, such as certain island communities of Indonesia as well as in Oceanic countries like Fiji. Sugarcane was an ancient crop of the Austronesian and Papuan people. It was introduced to Polynesia, Island Melanesia, and Madagascar in prehistoric times via Austronesian sailors. It was also introduced to southern China and India by Austronesian traders around 1200 to 1000 BC. The Persians and Greeks encountered the famous "reeds that produce honey without bees" in India between the sixth and fourth centuries BC. They adopted and then spread sugarcane agriculture. Merchants began to trade in sugar, which was considered a luxurious and expensive spice, from India. In the 18th century, sugarcane plantations began in the Caribbean, South American, Indian Ocean, and Pacific island nations. The need for sugar crop laborers became a major driver of large migrations, some people voluntarily accepting indentured servitude and others forcibly imported as slaves.

It is a tropical as well as a subtropical crop.
It grows well in hot and humid climates with a temperature of 21 oc to 27 oc and an annual rainfall of 75cm and IOOcm-
Irrigation is required in regions of low rainfall. It can be grown on a variety of soils and needs manual labour from sowing to harvesting-
India is the second-largest producer of sugarcane only after Brazil. It is the main source of sugar, gur (jaggary), khandsari, and molasses-
The major sugarcane-producing states are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kamataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Punjab, and Haryana.

sugar industry is 2nd most important agro-based industry in country.
brazil is top country with sugar cane production in world.

**top 5 countries (brazil, india, china, thailand, & pakistan) account for 73.70% of it.** ^52b2d9

[[india]] accounts for about 19% of [[world]]'s [[production]] of sugarcane. but it occupies only 2.4%of tot cropped area in country.
sugar [[industry]] is seasonal b/c of seasonality of raw materials. 
sugarcane is a weight-losing crop. ratio of sugar to sugarcane varies b/w 9 to 12 per cent depending on its variety..
its sucrose content begins to dry during haulage after it has been harvested from field.
better recovery of sugar is dependent upon its being crushed within 24 hours of its harvesting.
maharashtra has emerged as a leading sugar producer in country & produces more than one-third of total production of sugar in country
*uttar pradesh is second-largest producer of sugar.*
sugar factories are concentrated in 2 belts — ganga-yamuna doab & tarai region.
crop yield is low in northern india than in southem india. uttar pradesh's yield is low, but in maharashtra, karnataka, & tamil nadu yield is high.
