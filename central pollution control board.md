central pollution control board of india is a statutory organization established in 1974 under water (prevention & control of pollution) act. 
though, cpcb is also entrusted with powers & functions under [[air (prevention & control of pollution) act, 1981]].
however, it's established under water act.
one of significant drawbacks of act is that any air pollutant released into atmosphere by a ship or aircraft does not come under purview of act.
act was amended in 1987 to include noise as air pollutant.
