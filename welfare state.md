	- A welfare state is a concept of government where the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the [[economy|economic]] and social well-being of its citizens. It is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. The Directive Principles of State Policy embody the concept of a ‘welfare state’.
	- A fundamental feature of the welfare state is social insurance, a provision common to most advanced industrialized countries (National Social Assistance Programme). The welfare state also usually includes public provision of basic [[education]], health services, and housing etc. Under this system, the welfare of its citizens is the responsibility of the state. India is a welfare state. The fact that the [[preamble]] of the Constitution itself envisages India to be a ‘[[socialist]]’ state bears enough evidence for this.
