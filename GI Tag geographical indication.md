- a geographical indication (gi) is a name or sign used on products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (e.g., a town, region, or country). the use of a geographical indication, as an indication of the product's source, acts as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities, is made according to traditional methods, or enjoys a good reputation due to its geographical origin.
- article 22.1 of the trips agreement defines geographical indications as "...indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a member [of the world trade organization], or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin."
- appellation d'origine contrôlée ('appellation of origin') is a sub-type of geographical indication where quality, method, and reputation of a product originate from a strictly defined area specified in its intellectual property right registration.
