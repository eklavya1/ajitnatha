It is a holistic approach to agriculture that provides for human needs—high-quality food, fiber, fuel, medicine, and building materials—while enhancing the ecosystems and
communities from which these derive; it offers a set of ethics and principles and a means of integrating social and ecological processes in a way that is grounded in the
local context.
Permaculture is an attempt to best use land so that generations in the future can continue to make use of the land in productive manners, allowing for personal subsistence.
It draws from several disciplines including organic farming, agroforestry, integrated farming, sustainable development, and applied ecology.
Permaculture tries to look at a piece of land in a holistic manner, integrating every animal and plant living on it, and combining that with social structures designed to foster long-lasting agriculture as well.
Each element of a [[food cycle]] is broken down into what it requires and what it contributes, & then each element is pieced together to form a dynamically self-supp whole.
Permaculture lies on three ethics: care for the earth, care for people, and fair share.
They form the foundation for permaculture design and are also found in most traditional societies.
At the same time, permaculture moves beyond simply being a mechanical set of principles for the management of all cultures that can be used in designing sustainable systems.
Permaculture can be seen in contrast to intensive agriculture, which eventually leaves land unfit for farming.
## principles of permaculture
Observe and interact — by taking the time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation
Catch and store energy — by developing systems that collect resources when they are abundant, we can use them in times of need
Obtain a yield — ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work you are doing
Apply self-regulation and accept feedback — we need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well
Use and value renewable resources and services — make the best use of nature's abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources
Produce no waste — by valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste
Integrate rather than segregate — by putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other
Use and value diversity — diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
