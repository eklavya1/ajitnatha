- it is calculated by deducting [[depreciation]] from [[gross national product]] (gnp)
- nnp= gnp - depreciation
- factor cost - cost incurred to produce goods and service
- market price- for calculating market price we add indirect taxes and deduct subsidies given by the government in factor cost.
- market price = factor cost + indirect taxes — subsidy
- nnp at factor cost = nnp at market price — indirect taxes + subsidy
- usually, we call nnp at factor cost as national income.
- likewise, nnp at factor cost, we can also calculate gdp at factor cost.
