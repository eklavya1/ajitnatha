- pm resigns, if he loses the majority in the house is a convention and not mentioned in the constitution. conventions are unwritten practices which are binding on the three organs ofthe state. unlike the president, the prime minister does not have a fixed tenure. the full term of the prime minister is five years, which coincides with the normal life of the lok sabha. however, the term can end sooner ifhe loses the vote ofconfidence in the lower house. so, it can be said that he remains in power as long as he enjoys the confidence of the lok sabha. the prime minister can also resign by writing to the president. there are no term limits on the once of the prime minister. there is also no official retirement age.
