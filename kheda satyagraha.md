peasantry of kheda consisted mainly of patidars who were known for their skills in agriculture.
patidars were well-[[education|educated]].
kheda is situated in central part of [[gujarat]] & was quite fertile for cultivation of [[tobacco]] & [[cotton]] crops.
dr ws a severe famine in kheda, which failed crops.
[[government]] did not accept failure of crops but was insistent on collection of land tax, not considering conditions of peasants.
thus, kheda satyagraha was started in march [[1918]] under leadership of gandhiji, sardar [[sardar vallabh bhai patel]], n.m. joshi, & several others.
movement was terminated owing to acceptance of some of prime demands of peasantry.
as part of experiment, mahatma gandhi advised peasants to withhold payment of revenue till their demand for its remission was met.
struggle was withdrawn when it was learned that govt had issued instructions that revenue should be recovered only from those peasants who could afford to pay.
sardar vallabhbhai patel became a follower of gandhiji during kheda movement.
