- the ocean bottom is the benthic zone and the water itself (or the water column) is the pelagic zone.
- the neritic zone is that part of the pelagic zone that extends from the high tide line to an ocean bottom less than 600 feet deep.
- water deeper than 600 feet is called the oceanic zone, which itself is divided on the basis of water depth into the epipelagic, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic zones.
- the e*pipelagic* (euphotic) zone, also called the sunlit zone, receives enough sunlight to support photosynthesis.
- the temperatures in this zone range anywhere from 40 to â€”30c (104 to 27 of).
- the *mesopelagic* (disphotic) zone, where only small amounts of light penetrate, lies below the epipelagic zone.
- this zone is often referred to as the twilight zone due to its scarce amount of light. hence statement 1 is correct.
- temperatures in the mesopelagic zone range from 5 to 40c (41 to 390f).
- the pressure is higher here; it can be up to 1 ,470 pounds per square inch (10, 100,000 pa) and increases with depth.
- 90% of the ocean lies in the bathypelagic (aphotic) zone into which no light penetrates. hence statement 2 is correct.
- this is also called the midnight zone.
- water pressure is very intense and the temperatures are near freezing (range o to 60c (32 to 430f).
## abyssopelagic zone
- it is also known as the abyssal zone or simply as the abyss.
- it extends from 4,000 meters (13, 124 feet) to 6,000 meters (19,686 feet).
- the water temperature is near freezing, and there is no light at all.
## hadalpelagic zone
- this layer extends from 6,000 meters (19,686 feet) to the bottom of the deepest parts of the ocean.
- these areas are mostly found in deep water trenches and [[canyon]]s.
- the deepest point in the ocean is located in the [[mariana trench]] off the coast of [[japan]] at 35,797 feet (10,911 meters).
- the temperature of the water is just above freezing, and the pressure is 800 times that on the surface.
- in spite of the pressure and temperature, life can still be found here.
