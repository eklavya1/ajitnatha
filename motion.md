- a motion is a proposal for knowing decision or expressing opinion of house on a matter of public importance.
- every question that shall be decided by house of parliament must be proposed as a motion
- approval of presiding officer is essential to initiate a motion
- logic behind calling it a motion:
	- motion is so-called as it sets house in motions, as [[business]] of house, takes place on basis of motion.
## three types of motions
- **substantive motion:** it is self-contained independent proposals e.g. no-confidence motion, [[confidence motion]], [[adjournment motion]]
- **substitute motion:** it is moved in place of an original motion & it proposes an alternative to original motion.
- **subsidiary motion:** a motion that arises from a pre-existing motion. 3 types:
	- ancilliary motion: it is a motion that is used as a regular tool to proceed with various kinds of businesses of house.
	- superseding motion: such motion is moved in course of debate on another issue & seeks to supersede that issue.
	- amendment motion: it seeks to modify/substitute a part of original motion.
- **closure motion:**
- it is a motion moved by a member to cut short a debate on a matter before house.
- if motion is approved by house, debate is stopped immediately & matter is put to vote.
	- simple closure motion- on a matter which is sufficiently discussed & to put it to vote.
	- closer by compartments- in this case, clauses of bill or a lengthy resolution are grouped into parts before commencement of debate.
	- kangaroo closure- only imp. clauses are taken up for debate & voting, & intervening clauses are skipped over & taken as passed.
	- gullitone closure- when undiscussed clauses of a bill or a resolution are also put to vote along with discussed ones due to want of time.
- **adjournment motion**
- related to a matter of urgent public importance.
- it can be introduced only in lok sabha
- conditions needed:
	- it must relate to urgent public importance
	- it should not raise question of privilege of house.
	- it should not be a [[sub judice]] matter.
	- it should not revive a discussion that has already happened during same session.
- **no confidence motion**
- to express lack of confidence in executive by ls [[lok sabha]]
- it is drawn indirectly from _[[a75 Other provisions as to Ministers]]_ article 75(3) of constitution of india
- it could also be introduced only in lok sabha
- it can be introduced only once in a session.
