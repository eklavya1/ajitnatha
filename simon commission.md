- simon commission or indian statutory commission arrived in india in [[1928]] to study constitutional reform.
- simon commission was headed by sir john simon with 7 englishmen as its members.

- [[1927]], viceroy [[lord irwin]] called gandhi to [[delhi]] & informed him dt a report ws being prepared to bring statutory reforms in india.

- as per [[government of india act 1919]], it was decided that after 10 years from [[1919]] a commission will be set which will study working of this act & will see progress of this act.
 
- [[government of india act 1919]] said that participation of indians in [[british]] [[parliament]] will increase.

- this commission was supposed to be appointed in [[1929]] but was appointed in [[1928]] itself & since there were no indian members in it, indians saw this as an insult as they thought that some britishers cannot determine their destiny so this commission was boycotted.
- thus simon commission was appointed to see indian constitutional reforms.
