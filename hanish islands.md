the hanish islands (arabic: جزر حنيش) are an island group in the [[red sea]]. some of them are a part of [[yemen]], but before 1998 they were claimed by [[eritrea]] as well. after a case in an international court under the guidance of abdul karim al-iryani, yemen was granted full ownership of some parts of the islands, and eritrea was awarded the peripheral islands to the southwest.the three largest islands are jabal zuqar to the north (about 130 km2), al-anīsh al-kabīr (great anīsh) to the south (about 116 km2), with the much smaller al-anīsh al-ṣaghīr (little anīsh) in between.
