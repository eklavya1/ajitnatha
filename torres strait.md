The Torres Strait (/ˈtɒrɪs/), also known as Zenadh Kes, is a strait between [[Australia]] and the Melanesian island of [[New Guinea]]. It is  151 km (94 mi) wide at its narrowest extent. To the south is Cape York Peninsula, the northernmost extremity of the Australian mainland. To the north is the Western Province of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is named after the [[spanish]] navigator Luís Vaz de Torres, who sailed through the strait in [[1606]].
