- industrialisation (alternatively spelled industrialization) is the period of social and economic change that transforms a human group from an agrarian society into an industrial society. this involves an extensive re-organisation of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. historically industrialization is associated with increase of polluting industries heavily dependent on fossil fuels. with the increasing focus on sustainable development and green industrial policy practices, industrialization increasingly includes technological leapfrogging, with direct investment in more advanced, cleaner technologies.

the reorganization of the economy has many unintended consequences both economically and socially. as industrial workers' incomes rise, markets for consumer goods and services of all kinds tend to expand and provide a further stimulus to industrial investment and economic growth.  moreover, family structures tend to shift as extended families tend to no longer live together in one household, location or place.
