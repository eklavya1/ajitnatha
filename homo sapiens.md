	- Physicists had realised the limitations of human minds to understand how the world really works a century ago. The Nobel Prizes in Physics were awarded to Max Planck (1918), Albert Einstein (1921), Niels Bohr (1922), Louis de Broglie (1929) and Werner Heisenberg (1932). They displaced the Newtonian paradigm of physics, which had reigned for three centuries, which saw Nature as a machine that could be described with linear theories of cause and eﬀect. The essence of the new physics was that reality is not what it seems to be to the rational mind. More startling was the conclusion that the human mind can never know what reality is because it is limited to models that can satisfy only its internal logic [source - the hindu, 19th sep 2021, pg 8editorial - `over-simplified models,f complex social systems`]

- __[[Homo]] sapiens__ is a storytelling animal, that thinks in stories rather than in numbers or graphs, and believes that the universe itself works like a story, replete with heroes and villains, conflicts and resolutions, climaxes and happy endings. [[yuval noah harari]]
