Nanotechnology in India (1:13 PM)
[[morse code]]
In India, the number of research papers published in Nanotechnology is only 3rd in the world after China and USA.
We had a dedicated National Nano Mission which ended in [[2020]].
The government started this project in 2007 and renewed it in [[2014]].
Under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, there is a dedicated Nanotechnology Initiative Division which is taking several initiatives for developing Nanoelectronics in the country.

Despite a lot of progress, there is a lot of room for improvement such as:
	- The amount India spends on nanotechnology is just a fraction of research spending on countries like China, Japan, the USA, Russia, etc.
	- It is less than 0.1% of the GDP.
	- Even though India accounts for a high number of research papers in Nanotechnology, the same has not been reflected in a number of patents.
	- The contribution of the private sector in Nanotechnology has been minimal.
	- Despite enormous potential, private companies are not taking it up.
	- IIT Delhi- treats water effectively in the textile sector.
	- Regulation is not there regarding the use of Nanotechnology.
	- The number of graduates and postgraduates in nanotechnology is less compared to other nations. Eg- the USA, Russia, etc.
	- Incentives are given by the government to the researchers.
	- Higher education institutions are not impactful.
	- Lack of innovation.
	- Women's participation is less in STEM.

## Issues with Nanomaterials

Nanomaterials are highly reactive. They have boundary-crossing nature.
The term boundary-crossing nature so if not stored and transported safely, they can be released into the atmosphere and they can enter the food chain.
This is harmful to biodiversity as well as human health.
Nanoparticles are also harmful to soil and water.

## Quantum dots
(1:41 PM)
They are nano-scale crystals made of semi-conducting material. When the light of a frequency is incident on quantum dots, they will emit various colors depending upon the size and shape.
They have applications in many areas such as high resolution displaces, medicine, photovoltaic cells among others.

## Information technology and computers (ICT)
(1:57 PM)
ICT is a diverse set of technological tools and resources used to transmit, store, create, share or exchange information.
It involves computers, the internet, broadcasting technology, and telephony.
Electromagnetic spectrum
Frequency- no. of times a wave vibrates.
Gamma will come from nuclear radiations
X rays
UV light
Visible light (4000A-8000A)
1A=10-10 m
Infrared
Microwave
Radiowave- the frequency varies from 300 GHz to 300Khz.
Radio waves are generated artificially by transmitters and received by radio receivers using antennas.
To prevent interference between different users, the generation and transmission of radio waves are strictly regulated by national laws and coordinated by the international telecommunication union (ITU).
High-frequency bands provide access to higher bandwidth but are susceptible to signal degradation such as scattering, absorption. Eg- even rainfall or snowstorm can adversely affect high-frequency signals.
Waves per se do not contain any information, we need to encode information on it.
The encoding of information is called modulation.
There are 3 common methods to encode information.
Pulse modulation- we simply turn the wave on and off to send morse code.
Analog modulation- There are 3 ways to do that.
Amplitude modulation (AM)- the amplitude of the waves vary.
Frequency modulation (FM)- here only frequency varies, the benefit of FM is that it is immune to static. Since it uses a higher frequency (88-108 Mhz)
Phase modulation (PM) - it encodes a message signal as variations in the phase of carrier waves.
Digital modulation- while analog signals are continuous time-varying signals digital signals consists of discrete values.
Analog suffers from many losses such as distortions, interference, and security breach while digital signals allow communication to be more clear and accurate without losses.

The topic for the next class: ICT (To be continuedâ€¦)
