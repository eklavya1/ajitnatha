Nastaliq (; Persian: نستعلیق, IPA: [næsˈtʰæʔliːq]), also romanized as Nastaʼlīq, is one of the main calligraphic hands used to write the Perso-Arabic script in the Persian and Urdu languages, often used also for Turkish poetry, rarely for Arabic. Nastaliq developed in Iran from naskh beginning in the 13th century and remains very widely used in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan and other countries for written poetry and as a form of art.
