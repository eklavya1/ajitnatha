World History Class 02

American Revolution Continued (1:01 PM)

## Reasons for american revolution
### 7 years Global war
### Stamp Act 1765
After this act, there were uprisings in the towns and people began boycotting British goods
Leaders of colonies met in Stamp Act congress 1765 where they passed a petition titled 'Declaration of rights and grievances.
Through this, they raised the slogan 'no taxation without representation.
They argued that since settlers are not represented in British Parliament, the Parliament does not have the right to tax the colonies
Already under economic strain and due to the boycott of British goods, Britain repealed the Stamp Act of 1765
However, the settlers continued to boycott British goods, and British imports to 13 colonies were reduced to half
Their demand was No Taxation without representation and they wanted repeal of all taxes levied by the British Parliament
The British Parliament repealed all taxes except for the tax on tea.
It did not want to give an impression that Britain is giving up its right to tax the colonies
Therefore the tax on tea was kept as a symbol of British sovereign authority over colonies

## Boston Tea Party 1773
42:39 (time stap)
Settlers were not allowing the import of British tea.
Therefore the British ships with Tea cargo were stuck at the Boston Port in Massachusetts
In an incident, some settlers destroyed the tea cargo in these Ships and this event is called Boston Tea Party.
This destruction of the property led the British Parliament to pass the Coercive Act 1774 where the self-government rights of Massachusetts were taken away.
The colonies named these acts intolerable acts and they met in Philadelphia congress also known as the 1st Continental Congress 1774
Here the colonies demanded:
Repeal of intolerable acts 1774
They reiterated the slogan of NTWR
Freedom to decide tariffs
Freedom of trade with all countries and 
Right to set up indigenous industries in all sectors.
This resulted in the British declaring war on 13 colonies
The colonies in 1776 declared independence via a document 'The Declaration of Independence.
In it, they not just declared independence but also:
gave ideas on basis of which future society or polity of USA would be based
Declared colonies are united
All men are created equal
The idea of inalienable natural rights of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness
Declared independence because colonies are oppressed by Britain.
Policy of Mercantilism
NTWR
## Inspiration from enlightenment thinkers of the 17th and 18th centuries
[[american revolution]] and [[french revolution]] laid the foundation of the modern worl d
*Enlightenment thinkers gave ideas that became the foundation of Modern Polity*.
These ideas inspired the leaders of 13 colonies.
There exist natural rights to life, liberty, and property that can not be taken away by anyone
The idea of a social contract defining powers of the State and rights of the people.
The responsibility of the State is to ensure the enjoyment of the natural rights and the goal of the State is to ensure happiness
The idea of self-government, democracy, and even a republic
The idea of no taxation without representation
Separation of powers
Innocent until proven guilty
Accountability of the government and civil services
The equality that everyone is born free and equal

## Why did 13 colonies win the war of Independence?

The 13 colonies were supported by France and Spain. They gave arms and ammunition and France even sent troops. They wanted to reverse the losses of 7 years war.
Logistics: In a 7-year war Britain created an army among settlers and now 13 colonies had the logistical edge as they were fighting in their home and Britain was fighting a war across the Atlantic.
The turning point was the failure of the encirclement campaign by the British in 1777 i.e attempt to attack via Canada.

## Result of the American revolution 1765-1783

Second Treaty of Paris 1783:  France did not gain anything as Britain offered and colonies accepted direct negotiations.
This allowed Britain to keep France out of North America and 13 colonies got a better deal and both parties got early peace.
Spain was given back Florida.
13 colonies got independence
Perpetual peace and special relationship between Britain and 13 colonies.

## Following Radical changes / radical ideas were implemented as a result of the American Revolution

To not to have a Monarchy and be a Republic
It was the first major Anti-Colonial Struggle and defeated the top world power, Britain
First fully written Constitution for whole Union (1789)
No special privilege based on birth and to not to have a nobility. Apart from Britain, Feudalism existed in the whole world.
After Britain, it was the first to implement enlightenment ideas.
No deprivation of property without due process of law.
Fundamental Rights were ensured by the Bill of Rights, 1791.
The industrial revolution began properly only in 1865 however process of industrialization began after 1783.
13 colonies engaged in territorial expansion and they purchased Louisiana from France in 1803 (Spain gave Louisiana to France in 1802).
Florida was purchased from Spain in [[1819]], therefore, establishing a modern map of the USA.

## Negatives of the American Revolution or How the American Revolution was not truly revolutionary? (3:00 PM)
Negatives of the American Revolution or How the American Revolution was not truly revolutionary? (3:00 PM)

It was ironic that settlers overthrew the colonialism of Britain to engage in Colonialism by taking over lands by force from American Indians.
Therefore the right to property was meant only for settlers
Declaration of Independence 1776 stated that all men are created equal.
However, these men were not women as women did not get voting rights
These men were only propertied men as the right to vote was linked with property criteria and the poor did not get voting rights
Natives did not get citizenship or voting rights
These men were not Blacks as slavery continued and also Blacks did not get citizenship and voting rights
Gradual reforms:
1920: Right to vote to women
1924: Native Americans got citizenship and the right to vote
After the American Civil war(1861-65): Slavery was abolished
13th Amendment, 1865: Banned slavery
14th Amendment (1868): All Black males got citizenship
15th Amendment, 1870: Voting rights to Black
However, racism continued to exist to this day in American society despite a long struggle by Blacks in the USA that included the Civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

## Slave Trade
Slave Trade (3:30 PM)

Started by Portugal in Brazil
For labor in Plantations
Trans-Atlantic or triangular in nature
The industrial revolution did not increase the slave trade
Slavery abolished:
1789: France
1833: Britain
1865: USA

## 1861-65 Civil war
1861-65 Civil war (3:40 PM)

Abraham Lincoln, President of the USA, abolished slavery.
Northern States: Industrial economy
Southern States: Agrarian economy
Therefore the economy of the Southern States was dependent on Slaves.
The Southern States wanted a confederation where powers of Union government would be limited and more powers were given to the States.
Southern states of the USA declared independence from Union and this triggered the civil war between the union government and the Southern States.
Union government won the civil war and therefore the Union was preserved and Slavery was abolished in the whole of the USA.
