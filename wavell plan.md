- wavell plan is proposal initiated by [[british]] [[government]] to resolve deadlock in [[india]].
- this proposal was prepared by [[lord wavell]] who became viceroy of india in [[1943]] by succeeding [[lord linlithgow]].
- wavell was appointed by [[british]] [[government]] to reach a possible agreement for india's self-govemance.
- through wavell plan, he tried to find a way out from existing disagreements among different political groups of india.
- plan proposed by [[england]] through lord wavell is also known as breakdown plan.
- [[shimla conference]] - a meeting was held at visceral lodge in shimla, where viceroy lord wavell & prominent political leaders of british india discussed wavell plan
## main provisions of wavell plan are as follows
- british gvt would introduce constitutional reforms in india if all indian political parties would help british in [[world war 2]].
- new executive council with all indian members, except viceroy & commander in chief, would be formed at center.
- except for defence, all portfolios will be under control of indian members.
- caste hindus & muslims to have equal representation.
- reconstructed council was to function as an interim government within framework of [[1935]] act.
- governor-general was to exercise his [[veto]] on advice of ministers.
- possibilities were to be kept open for negotiations on a new constitution once war was finally won.
- failed due to disagreement on issue of muslim representation
	- muslim league: it wanted all muslims to be its nominees & also claimed a communal veto in executive council.
	- congress: it objected to plan as, "an attempt to reduce congress to status of a purely caste hindu party & insisted on its right to include members of all communities among its nominees."
- wavell announced breakdown of talks thus giving league a virtual veto.
- this strengthened league's position as was evident from elections in [[1945]]-46.

	- first presented at shimla conference [[1945]].named after viceroy of india, lord wavell.
	- second world war had caused many socio-economic problems in british empire, especially when it came to maintaining their overseas colonies. thus british government saw it fit to grant india freedom it had been demanding for so long. in addition, quit india movement & an increase in revolutionary activity only made british position in india tenuous at best.
	- [[lord wavell]], who became viceroy in [[1943]], was charged with presenting a formula for future government of india that would be acceptable to both [[indian national congress]] & all-india muslim league, allowing for a smooth transition of [[power]].
- wavell plan proposed following -
	- viceroy’s **executive council was to have all indian members** except [[viceroy]] himself & commander-in-chief.
	- council was to have a **‘balanced representation’** of all indians including ‘caste-hindus’, muslims, depressed classes, sikhs, etc. muslims were given 6 out of 14 members which accounted for more than their share of population (25%).
	- viceroy/governor-general would still have power of veto but its use would be minimal.
