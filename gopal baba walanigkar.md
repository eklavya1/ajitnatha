[[2022-04-24]] 17:13 [Gopal Baba Walangkar - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gopal_Baba_Walangkar)
Gopal Baba Walangkar, also known as Gopal Krishna, (ca. 1840-1900) is an early example of an activist working to release the untouchable people of India from their historic socio-economic oppression, and is generally considered to be the pioneer of that movement. He developed a racial theory to explain the oppression and also published the monthly journal Vital-Vidhvansak, targeted at the Brahmanical Orthodoxy.
