- One such site is Badami in the State of [[karnataka]]. Badami was the capital of the early Chalukyan dynasty which ruled the region from 543 to 598 CE. With the decline of the Vakataka rule, the Chalukyas established their power in the [[deccan]]. The Chalukya king, [[Mangalesha]], patronised the excavation of the Badami caves. He was the younger son of the Chalukya king, [[PulakesiI]], and the brother of [[Kirtivarman I]]. The inscription in Cave No.4 mentions the date 578â€“579 CE, describes the beauty of the cave and includes the dedication of the image of [[Lord Vishnu]]. Thus it may be presumed that the cave was excavated in the same era and the patron records his Vaishnava affiliation. Therefore, the cave is popularly known as the Vishnu Cave. Only a fragment of the painting has survived on the vaulted roof of the front mandapa.
- Paintings in this cave depict palace scenes. One shows Kirtivarman, the son of [[Pulakesi I]] and the elder brother of [[Mangalesha]], seated inside the palace withhis wife and feudatories watching a dance scene. Towards the corner of the panel are figures of [[indra]] and his retinue. Stylistically speaking, the painting represents an extension of the tradition of [[mural painting]] from Ajanta to Badami in South India. The sinuously drawn lines, fluid forms and compact composition exemplify the proficiency and maturity the artists had achieved in the sixth century CE. The gracefully drawn faces of the king and the queen remind us of the style of modelling in [[ajanta]]. Their eye sockets are large, eyes are half-closed, and lips are protruding. It is noteworthy to observe that the contours of different parts of the face create protruding structures of the face itself. Thus, with simple line treatment artists could create volume.
