- _related_ [[pareto principle]] | [[mba]] | [[caste system]] [[=How to Hide an Empire#^c219fa]]
- 90% of [[energy]] is lost during energy conversion, transfer from one trophic level to next, in [[metabolism]] viz. [[digestion]], [[respiration]], etc & in movement as heat [[energy]]
- on average, 10% of total energy is made available to next level
- [[pyramid of energy]] - for any kinda [[food chain]] always be upright
- this law is derivative of [[2nd law of thermodynamics]]
- [[vulture#^f1bb1b]] [[population]] declined due to [[biomagnification]] caused by [[diclofenac]] drug
- As a precaution against three species going extinct, BNHS set-up four breeding centres for Gyps Vultures:
	- Jatayu Conservation Breeding Centre, Pinjore, Haryana #pre 
	- Vulture Conservation Breeding Centre, Rajabhatkhawa, West Bengal _related_ [[vulture]]
	- Vulture Conservation Breeding Centre, Rani, [[assam]]
	- Vulture Conservation Breeding Centre, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh
- exceptions to 10% [[law]]
	- [[bioaccumulation]]

# ecological pyramids
[[pyramid of energy]]
	- always upright
[[pyramid of numbers]]
	- upright as well as inverted
	- in grassland ecosys - upright
	- spindle- shaped also there (like rhombus)
	
[[pyramid of biomass]]
	- upright as well as inverted
		- inverted - aquatic ecosys
			accumulation of biomass is higher from lowre to higher [[trophic level]]s

# Ecological Pyramids
1:12 PM
Pyramid of Energy: Always Upright.
Pyramid of Numbers: It can be upright as well as inverted. 
E.g.: Parasitic nutrition: number keeps on increasing. E.g.: 1 tree will support 6 birds, 1 bird will support around hundreds of lice, etc.
pyramid of Biomass may be upright or inverted. 
Pyramid of Biomass, inverted example: Aquatic ecosystem (algae, small fish, large fish)‚Äô.
# Law of 10%
(1:27 PM)
90% of [[energy]] is lost during energy conversion.
Transfer from one trophic level to another.
[[metabolism]] viz. Digestion, respiration, etc., and in movement as heat energy.
On average 10% of energy is made available for next trophic level.
energy pyramid is always upright. _related_ [[pyramid of energy]] | [[pyramid of numbers]] | [[pyramid of biomass]] 
# Bioaccumulation
- It refers to `process` of accumulation of toxic and harmful substances viz. Pesticides, heavy metals, etc. into [[trophic level]] of a [[food chain]]. E.g. Mercury, lead, etc.
# Bioconcentration
It refers to `amount` of toxic and harmful substances viz. Pesticides, heavy metals, etc. in trophic level of food chain, e.g. in milligrams.
# Biomagnification
- It refers to `increase` in concentration of harmful substances from one trophic level to another, such as pesticides, heavy metals. 
- These are not based on law of 10%.
# Ecosystem Productivity
(2:18 PM)
- [[ecosystem productivity]]
- Rate of generation of biomass/production of biomass.
- Or Storage of energy in an ecosystem.
- Expressed in gm/m2/year or kcal/m2/year.
- Measurement in terms of area and time (generally in a span of a year).

- Primary Productivity: (All [[autotrophs]])
- Secondary Productivity: (All [[heterotrophs]])

- Gross Primary Productivity: Total amount of biomass or energy in all producers.
- Net Primary Productivity: Gross - loss due to respiration. _related_ [[gst]]

- Gross Secondary Productivity: Total amount of biomass or energy in all consumers.
- Net Secondary Productivity: GSP- loss due to respiration.

- Lower Latitudes to higher latitudes, there is a decline in productivity of [[ecosystem]]s.
- Due to a decrease in sunlight, vegetation, rainfall, and decrease in biodiversity.
- There is also a gradual decline in biodiversity from lower latitude to higher latitude.
- From lower altitudes (e.g. from planes, foothills) to higher altitudes (e.g. peaks of Himalayas), there will be a decline in ecosystem productivity.
- Bottom: Evergreen forest, top: Alpines, glaciers: Lichens and mosses (due to decrease in temperature, rainfall, etc).
- All continents (forest, grassland NPP: 730 gm/m2/year) have more productivity than Oceans (NPP: 155 gm/m2/year)

- Higher Productive Ecosystems
- Tropical Rainforests, Mangrove Forests, Coral Reefs, Estuaries, Delta, Lagoon, Swamp, Marsh, Bog, Peatland, etc.

- Medium Productive Ecosystem
- Temperate/ Deciduous Forest, Boreal Forest (Taiga), Lakes, Grasslands, Agricultural land, etc.

- Lower Productive Ecosystems _related_ [[=book guns, germs and steel]] [[Prisoners of Geography]]
- Desert, Snow Capped/ Glacier Mountain Peak, Tundra, Permafrost, Arctic, Antarctic.
# Ecological Succession
- (3:21 PM)
- Succession refers to directional changes in structure and composition of biotic communities on a particular geographical area or a site. 
- E.g. Barren land, covered with rocks, will crumble into small pieces due to [[weathering]] (chemical/thermal, etc.), or natural agents like lichens can break down rocks, resulting in soil formation.
- Lichens break down rocks, bird or wind can carry spores, this will result in grass/plant growth, later shrubs, herbs, etc. and eventually a forest will be formed, hence about (200-300 years), same barren land may transform into a forest ecosystem. 
- Initial: Lichen or birds are called as pioneer communities (first to arrive).
- Ultimate: Forest is known as climax communities.
- Intermediate: Seral community (those before climax community). 
- Ecological Succession can happen on land or in water bodies.
- It starts with Pioneer communities (one who arrives earliest). 
- Followed by Seral at an intermediate stage.
- process gets stabilized/slowed down with formation of a climax community.
- Deserts, mountain slopes, ponds, lakes, etc. all can be site for ecological succession. 
- It is determined by climatic conditions of a geographical area.
# Primary Succession
- It occurs on a site that was not earlier colonized by vegetation or living organism.
- For example Barren land, desert, volcanic/lava landforms.
- Soil is formed for first time, site gets prepared (e.g. volcanic eruptions). 
- It occurs over a period of hundreds of years, a long time, a slow process. 
# Secondary Succession
- It occurs on a site that is already colonized with vegetation, i.e. presence of a climax community, but it gets disturbed either by natural causes or anthropogenic factors, e.g. forest fires, Jhum cultivation in Arunachal Pradesh, deforestation. Again forest comes after Jhumming. 
- Soil is already present on site. 
- It occurs over a small interval of a time period of a few years. 
- It is a relatively fast process. 
# Frederick E. Clement‚Äôs Theory
- He explained succession by following stages: 
- Nudation: Preparation of a bare/open site for succession to start.
- Invasion: Arrival of spores/seeds by wind/bird etc. on prepared site.
- Ecesis: Growth and establishment of initial vegetation on site.
- Competition: species will compete for light, water, nutrient, etc. on site.
- Reaction: Replacement of one species by another due to competition on site.
- Stabilization: Finally formation of Climax Communities on site.
- Different types of ‚Äòsere‚Äô (stages before climax): Hydro-sere (in water body), psammosere (in sand), halo-sere (in saltwater)
