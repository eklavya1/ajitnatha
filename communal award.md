- [[ramsay macdonald]], d british prime minister, announced a scheme of representation of d minorities, which came to be known as d communal award.
- the award not only continued separate electorates for d muslims, sikhs, indian christians, anglo-indians & europeans but also extended it to d depressed classes ([[scheduled castes]]).
- gandhi was distressed over this extension of d principle of communal representation to d depressed classes & undertook fast unto death in yeravada jail (poona) to get d award modified (which acc to [[br ambedkar]] was a form of coercion since gandhi was a representative of d upper castes & wanted to see d continuation of d [[status quo]]). at last, there was an agreement between d leaders of d congress & d depressed classes.

- the agreement, known as [[poona pact]], retained d hindu joint electorate & gave reserved seats to d depressed classes.
