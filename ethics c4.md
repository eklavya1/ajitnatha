## social media - impact on social & political culture:
in today's time, there is so much presence of social media that it impacted every aspect of life for eg social & political culture 

## social culture:
### positive impact
awareness with respect to (wrt) social evils in society 
leads to mobilisation & helps in assertion & hence lead to social change 
accommodative culture & tolerance towards diversity 
would also lead to strengthening of social capital
generate empathy & compassion towards marginalised sections of society 
would create a platform for 3ds ie **debate, discussion & deliberation**
with anonymity, it provides aspect of questioning regressive practices 
awareness & promoting of traditional values 
preservation & promotion of indigenous culture 
democratisation of social culture & breaking of stereotypes 
### negative impact
hatred & intolerance 
radicalisation 
generating prejudices 
anonymity - diffusion of responsibility 
fake news - exodus of communities 

## political culture
positive impact:
strengthening democracy 
accountability & responsibility will ensure good & smooth governance 
checks & balances - prevents hasty policy decisions 
legitimacy to govt 
mobilisation for a political cause eg umbrella movement (hongkong)
a platform for pressure groups/interest groups 
will ensure representation to every section of society 
provides voice to stakeholders 
negative impact:
fake news/narrative 
propaganda 
technology in itself is value-neutral. it depends on what use it has been put to will determine whether it's positive or negative - mohd yunus 

## bureaucratic attitude & democratic attitude
bureaucratic attitude & democratic attitude: (5:31 pm)

### bureaucratic attitude
bureaucratic attitude:
it defines attitude of public servants to strictly follow decision-making processcc to written rules & guidelines 
some basic attributes of this attitude are - objectivity, neutrality, top-down, rule orientation, secrecy, etc  
merits - decision making based on sops hence no partiality, quick decision making, easy to fix responsibility & hold others accountable in case of any problem
demerits - indifference to public opinion, apathy, resulting into alienation among public wrt process of governance; red-tapism, status quo, people are treated more like subject rather than stakeholders, corruption; it cripples capacity pf administrator to be innovative/creative; crisis of conscience 

### democratic attitude
this attitude encourages people's participation in decision-making process 
some basic attributes are compassion, empathy, participative, consultative, flexible, bottom-up 
merits - good governance & free flow of ideas, target-based approach or piecemeal engineering approach; internalization & acceptance of policies by public;  it helps in strengthening rights based approach 

demerits - delay in decision making, difficulty in arriving at consensus; problem of lack of informed participation (informed & active citizenry is necessary for efficient democracy)
overall, it should be combination of two; for ex, wrt to day-to-day decision making bureaucratic attitude can be used or wrt guidelines at macro level bureaucratic attitude can be used
however, when we have a large public interface  or ta level of implementation democratic attitude is welcome 

## functions of attitude
functions of attitude: (5:56 pm)

daniel katz's perspective:
need-based function 
knowledge function 
ego-defensive function 
value-expressive function 

need satisfaction:
many attitudes are formed as a result of our past rewards & punishment for saying or doing things 
once formed these attitudes usually continue to be useful in helping us satisfy our needs or reach our goals (utilitarian)
day it stops fulfilling our need, we will abandon attitude & replace it with a new 1 
for eg, we have a positive attitude towards a political party that will serve our political ambitions/advance our economic development/serve our social interest  
attitude changes with change in need or individual are convinced that new attitude suggested to him can meet his existing needs better 
eg - to change attitude wrt reservation, we can make agriculture lucrative or promote entrepreneurship 

knowledge function:
attitude helps attitude holders to organise & interpret a diverse set of information
they provide consistency & clarity in our explanation & understanding of events 
knowledge function of attitude does not imply that it's providing a factually correct information 
in fact, it provides a picture that is meaningful to individual who happens to hold this attitude 
such attitudes are likely to change when it becomes difficult to continue with existing attitude 
hence, with availability of counter-information, sustained availability will lead to internalisation of information 

## ego-defensive function of attitude
ego-defensive function of attitude: (6:30 pm)

we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of darkness & real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of light
attitude helps us to enhance our self-esteem, defend us against various arrows of life
it protects us from acknowledging basic truths about ourselves; it's a means to release frustration 
these defences are more used by those who are insecure & anxious 
very difficult to change this attitude as it stems from personality inadequacies 
hence, need of hour is to provide environment in which individual feels truly valued & ready to lower defences 
such exploration will require individual to experience empathy & unconditional positive regards 
eg - prejudiced attitude; grapes are sour; culture of blaming others; justifying your actions which can otherwise leave you embarrassed 

## value expression function
value expression function: (6:45 pm)

it helps a person to establish his identity & to convey both to himself as well as others what kind of person he is 
it helps us in exercise of impression management 
it helps us communicate who we are & makes us feel good because we have asserted our identity
ex - status on whatsapp; quotation on t-shirts; wearing sweatshirts of educational institutions, etc 
let us suppose core value of individual is freedom, as a result, individual encourages a flexible work schedule, democratic decision in organisation, freedom wrt dress code, etc 
change will occur if individual values have changed  or new attitudes will express underlying values better 

## attitude-behaviour (a-b) consistency
attitude-behaviour (a-b) consistency: (6:56 pm)

background & exs:
x has a prejudiced attitude against a certain community. hence being a landlord, x refused to give house on rent (a-b consistency)
lapierre study - attitude is not always consistent with behaviour
it was reflected in this study wrt racial attitude towards chinese couples in america 
study by corey - cheating behaviour does not depend on attitude towards cheating but how poorly 1 has performed in exam 
factors affecting (a-b) consistency:
individual factors:
high on self-monitoring - in diff situations with diff people they act like  every diff person 
their behaviour results from pragmatic concern about what is appropriate in each situation 
low on self-monitoring -  their behaviour is usually expression of their true feelings, attitude & beliefs 
situational factors:
attitude as a heuristic - when you have information overload; no time to plan or contemplate before behaviour 
hence, whatever attitude you possess you will act accly
for ex, brand impact on behaviour; recruitment in organisation;  
bandwagon effect - suppose you have x attitude & others have y attitude & you hold other in high regards then there is very less probability of a-b consistency, etc
