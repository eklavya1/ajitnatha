- deficits, budget deficits, monetized deficits, ways & means advances, elimination of budget deficit post wma agreement, frbm act.

- today’s discussion: (1:18 pm)

- target is to bring FD to 3%.
- to achieve these targets govt has to lay down fiscal consolidation path.
- our present fd (= te – total non-debt receipt) is 6%.
- in [[parliament]], govt has to give expected targets. like fd target, expected te, expected gdp, expected non-debt receipt.
- there is also medium-term expenditure strategy.
- these targets on year-wise, form part of fiscal consolidation path.
- in [[2010]], govt said dt it'll now target effective deficit.
- rd = re – rr, & re also includes transfers to states (it has nothing to do with finance commission).
- these transfer to state includes transfers md to states fr implementation of central govt. schemes.
- as these schemes are implemented by states only. so, all such transfers are part of revenue expense.
- so out of ds transfer if any part of it's used fr creation of capital assets, then we deduct ds part to arrive at effective revenue deficit
- in [[2015]], nk singh committee was constituted to relook frbm act. committee gave its recommendations in [[2016]].
- fiscal deficit (flow) refers to borrowing in current year while debt (stock) is total outstanding amount at point in time. it's accumulated unpaid deficit over period of time.
## counter-cyclical fiscal policy
- counter-cyclical fiscal policy:
- when gdp is high then tax revenue is high in dt period. hence, expenditure is also high during dt phase of high growth.
- if gdp is low then tax revenue'll be low & so'll be expenditures in ds low phase of growth.
- in high phase govt. requirement to spend is low as people'll be mr well off while in low phase requirement to spend is high as people are nt well off.
- so, there is mismatch b/w capacity & requirement during diff phases of growth. with decreasing growth rate ability to borrow also decreases.
- nk singh recommended dt spend less during high growth phase by lowering fiscal deficit target & increasing it during low growth phase.

## analysis of frbm act
- analysis of frbm act: (2:30 pm)
- frbm act has been amended multiple times as govt was unable to meet targets laid therein.
- as result, frbm act lost its sanctity.
- in ds context govt constituted [[nk singh committee]] (chairman of 15th fc {financial comm}) to recommend amendments to frbm act so dt borrowing of govt remains sustainable.

## nk singh committee recommendations
- rather than targeting only fiscal deficit, we sd target govt debt as well.
- [[government]] debt was recommended to be capped at 60% of [[gdp]] fr general govt, wch was 40% fr center & 20% fr all states combined.
- within ds overall target, fiscal deficit of 3% was to be maintained. fd cd then be md flexible with respect to overall debt target.
- circumstances _ wch fd cd exceed target of 3% were clearly laid down.
- there are 5 conditions & if any 1 of them is met, it gives legitimate reason fr govt to breach fd target. these include contraction in gdp, situations of pandemic & [[war]], high [[unemployment]], etc. [* refer to your handout fr details]
- he recommended countercyclical fiscal policy of govt wch wd enable it to spend mr during times of economic downturn by saving during time of economic boom. ds wd increase govt’s borrowing capability despite fall in its revenue during downward economic cycle.
- at present expenditure & thus fiscal deficit's aligned with economic cycle, wch he recommended sd become counter-aligned.

## sustainability of debt
2:46 pm
- [*refer economic survey of 2020-21 chapter on debt sustainability (rating agencies)]

### public debt
- public debt: (4:02 pm)

- it refers to [[debt]] of govt. it's divided into internal public debt or simply internal debt wch means debt owed to residents. e.g. debt to citizens, debt incurred by issuing govt bonds. t-bills, securities, to resident entities, debt fm domestic banks etc.

- external public debt (not c/a external debt, external public debt (EPD) is just 1 part of external debt): it's debt owed to non-resident entities fr ex other countries, multilateral organisations, fiis, foreign banks, etc.

## external debt
- debt owed by residents to non-residents.
- it's further divided into external public & external private debts.

- includes borrowings fm foreign govts & multilateral agencies, 
- *external commercial borrowings (ECB i.e. borrowings fm abroad on commercial basis cn be incurred by both govt & private entities).*
- also includes borrowings done by issuing bonds in foreign market. when they are issued by govt, they are c/a sovereign bonds.
- sometimes bond may be issued in foreign markets but is denominated in domestic currency. these are offshore-rupee denominated bonds, commonly referred to as [[masala bond]]s.
- g. bonds issued by indian railways in london market but denominated in rupees. in these bonds, exchange rate risks are borne by lender i.e. bondholder.
- other liabilities of govt: govt holds money of public as trustee as well. these monies (diff types of currencies) dt govt hold has to be paid back along with interest to public.
- these include monies such as those in nssf (national small saving funds), wch is part of public account of india.

## principles of debt management
- principles of debt management: (4:19 pm)
- **debt is deemed sustainable if it's compliant with foll principles:**
- low [[cost]] of borrowing.
- a preferably long-term maturity profile.
- preferably denominated in domestic [[currency]].
- preferably sourced fm domestic sources.c
- to assess whether debt is sustainable or not, country’s growth rate, wch is indication of growth in govt revenues, is most imp factor.
- apart fm it, its forex reserves are also imp factor if debt is fm external sources.
- ** responsibility of debt management was with [[rbi]] since [[independence]], but since [[2008]] it has gradually started to move away fm it to independent agency wch is pdma (public debt management agency). yet it's nt fully established.

- next class: taxation.
