# civil rebellion
1. grievances of local rulers 
	1.  [[doctrine of lapse]] = in absence of a legal heir, [[british]] reserved the right to annex an indian stated _related_ [[doctrines]]
	2.   under dalhousie 4856, there was a policy shift towards direct annexation (doctrine of lapse & maladministration) #pneumonic _dad dol_, where dol is an #abbreviation of doctr...lapse
2. grievance of aristocracy or old bureaucracy, loss of status as no or little role post-annexation. so these elements also provided leadership during 1857 revolt (mar 1857-1858). some examples of leadership -
	1. [[nana sahib]] - adopted son of the last peshwa [[bajirao ii]] (9619, [[1736]]-1819), took leadership in kanpur
	2. begum hazrat mahal took leadership in lucknow
	3. khan bahadur khan from [[rohilkhand]]
	4. rani lakshmi bai in [[jhansi]]
3. grievances of [[talukdar]]
	1. they lost land after the [[mahalwari settlement]] which was made directly with the village community 
	3. loss of status-
		1. loss of land
		2. demolishing of their forts & they were disarmed
		3. post [[british]] annexation they were equal in the eyes of the [[british]] law, loss of feudal privilege. so, they also provided leadership to the peasants
4. grievances of the peasants
		1. up = avadh+northwest provinces
		2. because of summary settlement, the land revenue demand was high which led to indebtedness & loss of land to moneylenders consequently
		3. [[britain]] introduced new civil courts. this made justice expensive (you would have to hire lawyers + distant) because are far away in city. these courts favoured the moneylenders.
		4. common grievance - fear of religious conversion (post 1813 ?)
# events during revolt 1857
1. sepoys are joined by peasants 
2. peasants & sepoys pressurise feudal elements to take leadership of revolt
3. goal of revolt 
	1. to get rid of [[british]] from hindustan, which is for [[hindu]]s & [[muslim]]
	2. mutineers declared zafar as the emperor of hindustan 
4. high violence from both sides 
5. temporarily [[british]] rule collapsed
6. circulation of chapati from village to village became a symbol of spread of revolt 
7. result - [[british]] reprisal was very harsh, by 1858 end revolt failed
	
# reasons for [[british]] strength 
1.  [[british]] had [[military]] strength
	1.  streamlined, efficient [[bureaucracy]]. clear hierarchy of command was there
	4.  the [[british]] gained definitive edge with arrival of fresh troops from [[britain]]
2. indian weaknesses
	1. poorly armed peasants
	2. problems of coordination and [[communication]]
		[[george friedman#^e97f3d]]
	3. absence of centralized leadership with single chain of command, because regional leader acted independently
	4. all indians did not participate
		1. mainly [[bengal]] army participated
		2. peasants - those regions which benefitted from [[british]] rule saw low participation. 
			1. eg- [[punjab]], here middle income peasants of canal colonies had benefitted from irrigation infrastructure created. 
			2. in south india, ryotwari settlement gave land rights to individual peasants. 
			3. in bengal, middle and rich class benefitted from permanent settlement of [[1793]]

5. middle class intelligentsia supported [[british]] eic because they believed that [[british]] rule will modernize india and did not want the return of nawabs and rajas _related_ [[medici]]

6. those princes and taluqdars who did not loose their position did not participate

# terms-
1. revolt - act of opposing authority violently
2. revolution - huge change or transition. leads to 
3. movement - should have some ideology and organizational. a movement should have continued actions to achieve specific goals. it can involve different kind of actions (revolt, petitioning, dharna)
# ******************************
# was 1857 a nationalist movement ?
[[1857]]
1. colonial view
	1. it was merely a sepoy mutniy & breakdown of law and order
	2. there was no sense of nationalism, everyone was fighting for their own selfish interests 

2. it was more than a mutiny but less than a nationalist movement
	1. not all indians participated, therefore not a nat'l mov
	2. spontaneous, not a planned movement but spontaneous outburst.
	3. no concrete alternative for a post-[[british]] era

3. it was more than a mutiny + a nationalist movement
	1. karl marx called [[1857]] a nationalist revolt + savarkar also said that
4. rebels were not restricted to their areas. leaders of central & north india communicated with each other.
5. common fear of christianity & corruption of existing religion & tradition
6. common goal of restoring the moral order which was disturbed by the [[british]] rule. i.e. [[british]] rule was unethical.
	1. loss of lands
	2. high oppressive land rev demands
	3. conversion, etc
7. they didn't want to remove brits from local area, but from the face of hindostan itself
		1. it was more than an immediate grievance 
		2. therefore not just because of selfish interest

8. there was hindu-muslim unity during the revolt
9. it was a movement at the grass-root level
10. in the beginning, people forced elites to take leadership & later when leaders submitted people still continued the revolt 

//as upsc aspirants we agree to point to #2 however, the movement had one common goal of removal of [[british]] who were their common enemy.

# revolt of 1857 was a watershed movement in indian history-
1. it ended company rule of eic & [[british]] state replaced it
2. india became part of [[british]] empire as sovereignty now lay under the crown i.e. government of india act 1858, made the [[british]] state the ruler of india
3. queen became ==qaiser-i-hind== or empress of india {from the word [[caesar]]}, officially she took the title in [[1877]] ("coronation of queen") [[roman empire]]
4. goi act [[1858]], created position of "secretary of state for india" who would be the final authority over viceroy in india
5. there was a proclamation by the queen post 1857 revolt
6. [[britain]] blamed eic for its management of india, like intereferring in socio-religious aspects
7. india will be rules as per indian traditions, so social reforms took a backseat
8. a belief developed among [[british]]ers that indians are beyond reforms. inevitability. they developed a distrustful attitude towards indians, started thinking that indians are barbaric ([[british]] women were paraded naked by indians, brit kids were killed, we were no good either). hence, [[british]] rule became more authoritative & racist so as to prevent another event like 1857. also, separateness b/w indians and [[british]] increased.
9. hence, cultural [[colonialism]] increased.
	1. eg- statements like "dogs and indians not allowed" in front of restaurants
10. changes were brought in army, police and civil services.

(terms- benevolent colonialism, moderniser, [[british]] as trustee of india. white man's burden)
preventing barbarians from destroying the status quo
the grand chessboard
aloha, modernity descends upon us !

1. for better control of india, foll changes were brought-
	1. main focus now became efficient collection of information and intelligence
	2. police commission of [[1860]], led to indian police act, [[1861]], which estd proper structure and hierarchy that led to effective command and control. this structure stayed till [[1847]] (.??? 1947)  i.e.
						1. concept of state police. province level organization of police with ig as head reporting to governor 
						2. districts under dsp {district sp} reporting to the collector
						3. thanas under sub-inspector reporting to sp

2. [[british]]ers ensured exclusion of indians from senior positions
# peel commission
- #committee 
1. it led to changes in the army
2. to prevent homogeneity & ensure heterogenous mix of castes in each regiment. this was because bengal army had domination of upper castes. mixing of caste will prevent sepoys uniting against the [[british]].
3. to prevent inter-regional interaction among regiments of different regions. this will prevent pan-indian unity
4. recruitment increased from areas which remain loyal during [[1857]]
	1. [[punjab]]
	2. gurkhas
	3. concept of martial race
		1. recruitment from martial races increased
		2. eg- [[jats]], [[sikhs ☬]], [[rajput]]s
		3. brits believed that these groups are loyal and good fighters but not smart enough to be leaders (hence pose no threat to them)
		4. promoted the concept of loyalty to the salt
		5. maintained huge standing army
		6. ratio of 1:2 i.e. brits to indian sepoys in [[army]]

4. changes in civil services 
	1. [[1853]]: civil services were opened to indians via exam
	2. post-[[1857]] = exam to be held in england & no simultaneous exam in india (raising artificial obstacles for indians). english bureaucracy opposed simultaneous exam demand of middle class
	3.they opposed any talk of elections in india
# [[british]] imperial ideology
## orientalism
1. in [[1700]]s
2. indian civilisation is a great civ
3. europeans & indians are kins (indo-european lang similarity). language = barometer of culture & indian languages have similarities with their european counterpart. therefore, indian civ is at par with greek, roman civ
4. product
	1. we will help restore glory of past to indians
	2. govern india the indian way (sharia law, dharmashastras)
	3. focus on training eic officials in indian languages & culture

## authoritarianism (cornwallis 8693, 17th siecle)
- [[lord cornwallis]]
1. realization that ancient [[india]] was great but present is degenerated [[patterns of history]]
2. indians need [[british]] ideas for upliftment

1. concept of rule of law & equality before law
2. capitalism in the domain of economy 经济 {permanent settlement} 
3. effective police organization
4. liberalism ([[1800]]s)
	1. indian conquest has been through sins & crimes, now give indians best ideas of the age
		1. western [[education]] (in english language)
		2. codification of laws
5. [[utalitarianism]]
	1. policies which bring maximum good for maximum 人民
	2. with good governance we can emancipate indians , but , via good laws
	3. good administration 
6. [[evangelicalism]]
	1. path to modernization is via [[christianity]] (conversion,english education, missionaries)
