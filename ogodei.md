- Ögedei Khagan (also **ogodei**; c. 1186 – 11 December [[1241]]) was the *third son* of [[Genghis Khan]] and second khagan-emperor of the [[Mongol]] Empire, succeeding his father. He continued the expansion of the empire that his father had begun, and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the Mongol invasions of Europe and Mongol conquests of China. Like all of Genghis' primary sons, he participated extensively in conquests in [[China]], [[Iran]], and [[Central Asia]].
