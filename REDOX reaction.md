oxidation & reduction reactions:-
addition of oxygen to a substance or removal of hydrogen from a substance is c/a oxidation.
removal of oxygen from a substance or addition of hydrogen to a substance is c/a reduction.
o oxidation & reduction reactions take place side by side & are c/a redox reactions.
o substance which gives oxygen for oxidation, or removes hydrogen (i.e., brings about oxidation), is c/a oxidizing agent.
o substance which gives hydrogen for reduction, or removes oxygen (i.e., brings about reduction), is c/a a reducing agent.
o a common ex of reduction in hydrogenation of vegetable oil (liquid) leads to production of vanaspati ghee (solid fat).
another common effect of oxidation reactions observed in daily life is corrosion of metals.
	• corrosion is process in which metals are destroyed gradually by action of air, moisture, or a chemical on their surface.
	• it's mainly caused by aerial oxidation.
	• rusting of iron metal is a common ex.
	• iron is oxidized by oxygen present in air in presence of moisture to form hydrated ferric oxide (rust) which is reddish-brown in colour.
	• corrosion weakens iron & steel objects, like bodies of vehicles, bridges, ships, etc. rust flakes off & exposes a fresh surface of iron, thus continuing process
souring of milk: milk souring is k/a a chemical transition or chemical change because it ends up forming a new product that is lactic acid, hence leaving milk sour.
there is no removal or addition of hydrogen or oxygen.
