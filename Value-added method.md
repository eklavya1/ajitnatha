- [[2021-12-09]] `21:29` _related_ [[Calculation of output using the product method]] | [[gst]]
- It changes the way in which output is measured by looking at the value-added in each stage of [[production]] of a good rather than the value of the good itself.
- Value of any good can be seen to be comprised of value-added during the stages of production of that good.
- Value of good = Value added by the producer + value of inputs (1)
- Value of inputs = Value of inputs by intermediate goods (IG) producer. (2)
- Value of output of an IG producer = value added by an IG producer+ value of inputs used by an IG producer. (3)
- Using 1, 2, and 3- it can be seen that the value of any good can be broken down multiple stages to the value-added in each stage.
- Eventually, the value of input becomes zero and all we are left with is the value-added at all stages of production.
- Value of a good= Value added1+ VA2+VA3+…
- At the [[economy]] - wide level, the value of all the final goods produced in the economy will simply be the summation of value added by all the producers in the economy irrespective of whether they are producing intermediate or final goods.
- The value of output calculated using the value added method is denoted by GVA ie [[Gross Value Added]].
