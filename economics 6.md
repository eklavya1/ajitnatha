## REASONS FOR INEQUALITY
(2:48 pm)
### (I) Conventional reasons
- Traditionally inequality has been explained using the natural differences that may be there between two places, societies, or people.
- These include geographical reasons as well as sociological reasons such as accidents of birth. _related_ [[=unrivaled]] | [[=curse of geography]] | [[george friedman]] [[_geography 地理学 MOC]]
- Also, [[comparative advantages]] that a person or a place may enjoy over another have also been used to explain inequality.
### (II) Economic Reasons
- Traditionally, the differences in the incomes earned by different factors of [[production]] were used to explain economic inequality. _related_ [[4 factors of production]]
- Wages earned by labor & [[profit]]s earned by entrepreneurs; Profits have been compared to low wages in the past to explain high inequalities. _related_ [[entrepreneurship]]
- While it is true that profits are greater than wages, however, the entrepreneur earns not just for the risks he undertakes, but also for multiple responsibilities performed. In any case in a competitive market, a firm's profit cannot be high. In perfect competition, a firm earns zero profits. _related_ [[peter thiel]] | [[mba]] | [[apex predator]] [[caste system]]
	- also one should highlight the fact that only 2/10 (?? maybe 20) firms stay alive after 20 years of staying in the market, so the equation is balanced !!!! there is no class conflict as [[karl marx]] would have it
_- The modern explanation for inequality uses the ability to generate exceptional returns as a more prominent reason for inequality._
- A firm is able to earn _supernormal_ profits when it operates in a monopolistic setup. In such a setup, the firm dictates prices & also earns profits from the entire market.
- As opposed to it, in a competitive setup, a firm will not be able to dictate price & also will share the [[market]] with other firms.
- [[knowledge]] of benefits in a monopolistic setup induces a firm to create a monopoly for its goods & services.
- Either it does this by differentiating its products or by creating conditions anemical/unfavorable to competition.
- In modern times, firms indulge in unfair market practices to create barriers to entry for new firms thereby developing a monopolistic setup. _related_ [[caste system]] | [[charles darwin]] | [[_anthropology moc|anthropology]]
- In countries with a weaker rule of law, the firms try to influence policy decisions in such a manner that excludes competition from entering in the market. _related_ [[david vs goliath]]
- In more developed countries, firms exclude competition by creating _artificial barriers_ by themselves. _related_ [[netflix house of cards#^ef9e89]] [[sanction]]
- Therefore, the modern economic reason for inequality is the creation of barriers to disallow new firms to enter & therefore stopping the creation of a competitive setup. This allows the firms to earn exceptional returns.
