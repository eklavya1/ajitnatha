Rythu Bandhu is a scheme under which the state government extends financial support to land-owning farmers at the beginning of the crop season through direct benefit transfer so that they can take care of the initial investment needs and do not fall into a debt trap.
This in turn instils confidence in farmers, enhances productivity and income, and breaks the cycle of rural indebtedness.
Since 2018, when the scheme was launched by the state govemment, the government has been crediting Rs 5000 per acre per season into 
bank accounts of land-owning farmers ahead of Rabi and Kharif seasons.
Each farmer gets Rs 5,000 per acre per crop season without any ceiling on the number of acres held. So, a farmer who owns two acres of land 
would receive Rs 20,000 a year, whereas a farmer who owns 10 acres would receive Rs 1 lakh a year from the government.
The grant helps them cover the expenses on input requirements such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and labour.
