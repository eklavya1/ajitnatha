under air act, all industries operating within designated air pollution control areas must obtain a "consent" (permit) from state boards.
states are required to prescribe emission standards for industry & automobiles after consulting central board &  noting its ambient air quality standards.
act grants power to spcb to test equipment & to take sample for purpose of analysis from any chimney, fly  ash or dust, or any other.
prior to its amendment in 1988, enforcement under act was achieved through criminal prosecutions initiated by boards.
