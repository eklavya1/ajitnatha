## samkhya (kapila)
it is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems, and it postulates that everything, in reality, stems from purusha (self, soul, or mind) and prakriti (matter, creative agency, energy).
## yoga (patanjali)
yoga literally means the union of two principal entities.
yogic techniques control body, mind & sense organs, thus considered as a means of achieving freedom or mukti.
## nyaya (gautama muni)
this philosophy states that nothing is acceptable unless it is in accordance with reason and experience (scientific approach).
nyaya is considered a technique of logical thinking.
## vaisheshika (kanada)
the basis of the school's philosophy is that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to a finite number of atoms and brahman is regarded as the fundamental force that causes consciousness in these atoms.
## purva mimamsa (jaimini)
this philosophy encompasses the nyaya-vaisheshika systems and emphasizes the concept of valid knowledge.
according to purva mimamsa, vedas are eternal and possess all knowledge.
## vedanta
• the vedanta, or uttara mimamsa, school concentrates on the philosophical teachings of the upanishads (mystic or spiritual contemplations within the vedas), rather than the
brahmanas (instructions for ritual and sacrifice).
• the school separated into six sub-schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries:
