another method of reducing or preventing soil erosion on mountain slopes.
usually done on slopes, by levelling off areas on slope to prevent flow of water down it.
in this method, terraces are created on steep slopes.
in this, slopes of hill are converted into horizontal terraces of regular intervals which allow cultivation of crops.
it also reduces surface runoff along slopes & helps in preventing soil erosion.
there are disadvantages to terracing, however, in that terraces themselves cn be easily eroded & they generally require a lot of maintenance & repair.
