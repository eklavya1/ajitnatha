Froth means a mass of small bubbles on a liquid surface. It is also referred to as the aggregation of bubbles on an agitated liquid.
Since Yamuna River falls from a great height in the Okhla barrage, it leads to bubble formation. Also, during winters the temperature dips to near zero. In this way, froth is also be formed naturally.
Hence, foam formation is accompanied. The chemical factors responsible for foam formation and frothing are Ammonia increase from untreated household waste containing detergent and phosphorous increase in effluent released from industries etc.
The froth on the Yamuna river reflects the adverse impact of manmade activities on the environment and urgent steps are to be made in this regard to prevent further deterioration.
