National Air Quality Index was launched by the Prime Minister in April 2015 starting with 14 cities to disseminate air quality information.
The AQI has six categories of air quality, viz Good, Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor and Severe with distinct colour schemes.
Each of these categories is associated with likely health impacts.
AQI considers eight pollutants (PMIO, PM 2.5, N02, S02, CO, 03, NH3 and Pb) for which (up to 24-hourly averaging period) National Ambient Air Quality Standards are prescribed.
