coal & some forms of iron ore are found in [[sedimentary rocks]].
in sedimentary rocks, several minerals occur in beds or layers. they have been formed as a result of deposition, accumulation, & concentration in horizontal strata. coal & some forms of iron ore have been concentrated as a result of long periods under great heat & pressure.
another group of sedimentary minerals includes [[gypsum]], potash salt, & sodium salt.
these are formed as a result of evaporation, esp in arid regions.
major metallic minerals like tin, copper, zinc, & lead, etc. are obtained from igneous & metamorphic rocks.
in igneous & metamorphic rocks, minerals may occur in cracks, crevices, faults, or joints.
smaller occurrences are c/a veins & larger is c/a lodes. in most cases, they are formed when minerals in liquid/ molten & gaseous forms are forced upward through cavities towards earth's surface. they cool & solidify as they rise.
[[bauxite]] ore is not found in placer deposits. bauxite is found in form of residual mass which remains after decomposition & removal of soluble constituents.
decomposition of surface rocks, & removal of soluble constituents, leaving a residual mass of weathered material containing ores is 1 of how minerals are formed. bauxite is formed this way.
