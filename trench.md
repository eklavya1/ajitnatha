a trench is a type of excavation or in the ground that is generally deeper than it is wide (as opposed to a wider gully, or ditch), and narrow compared with its length (as opposed to a simple hole or pit).in geology, trenches result from erosion by rivers or by geological movement of tectonic plates. in civil engineering, trenches are often created to install underground utilities such as gas, water, power and communication lines. in construction, trenches are dug for foundations of buildings, retaining walls and dams, and for cut-and-cover construction of tunnels. in archaeology, the "trench method" is used for searching and excavating ancient ruins or to dig into strata of sedimented material. in geotechnical engineering, trenches serve for locating faults and investigating deep soil properties. in trench warfare, soldiers occupy trenches to protect them against weapons fire. 

trenches are dug by use of manual tools such as shovels and pickaxes, or by heavy equipment such as backhoes, trenchers and excavators.

for deep trenches, the instability of steep earthen walls requires engineering and safety techniques such as shoring. trenches are usually considered temporary structures to be backfilled with soil after construction, or abandoned after use. some trenches are stabilized using durable materials such as concrete to create open passages such as canals and sunken roadways.
