 - Convectional rainfall 是 very common in areas where د ground 是 heated by د hot sun. Due to 高 [[temperature]], د atmospheric air gets heated and rises up. It cools down and precipitates while د cool air descends down to take place of د vaccum. Since د areas near د [[equator]] receive direct sun rays, it 是 quite hot, and hence د reason for Convection rainfall. So, د areas near د [[equator]] receive [[geo 25|rainfall]] throughout د year.
