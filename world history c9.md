World History Class 09

Class started at (9:00 AM)

World War-1 (1914-19)

MAP reading of WW1 countries
It was fought between allied power (Britain, France, Russia, Belgium, Serbia, USA, Italy) vs central powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary empire, ottoman empire, Bulgaria)
Allied powers were democracies whereas central powers were either weak democracies or absolutist monarchy
Reasons behind WW1
There was a rise in nationalism in Europe since the French revolution of 1789.
Therefore, there existed a culture of romanticism that is a spirit of sacrifice for the nation among the public
Therefore, there was support for achieving national interest even it meant war.
There was public pressure on governments to have a larger colonial empire due to nationalism.
Post 1870 there was industrialization in the rest of Europe and European powers desired colonies as they would ensure the supply of cheap raw materials and also exports markets for their factories.
therefore, industrial capitalism to rivalries for colonies.
Many conflicts arose during the scramble for Africa as a result and these tensions contributed to WW-1.
A war victory over the arrival of colonial powers would lead to taking over colonies and therefore colonial expansion.
Britain Germany rivalry.
There was the rise of Germany as a second naval power in Europe which made Britain anxious over the colonial empire.
Therefore, Britain’s German naval rivalry contributed to tensions and Britain opposed the expansion of naval power by Germany.
France Germany rivalry
Germany was a late entrant in imperialism and empire building (Like Italy) as it got unified only in 1870
However German economy and military rapidly expanded and by 1914 it was far ahead of all European powers except Britain.
Germany desired 2nd largest colonial empire in line with its power status in Europe.
This led to Germany’s France rivalry as France was an old colonial power with 2nd largest empire.
There was also France had lost Alsace Lorrain a coal-rich area in the Franco-Prussian war 1870.
This also contributed to tensions between Germany and France.
The colonial rivalry between the two manifested in Morocco in form of the Madrid conference of 1818, the Morocco crisis of 1906, AGADIR crisis of 1911 (refer to colonialism in Africa)
Germany was isolated in the conferences held over a dispute in Morocco.
Serbia vs Austria Hungary.
Serbian nationalism contributed to nations between the two.
Serbia wanted all slaves of the Balkan peninsula to be part of Yugoslavia. However, this threatened the territorial integrity of Austria Hungary empire.
As Yugoslavia would require removal of slav populated territory of Austria Hungary.
The creation of Yugoslavia would have led to other ethnicities in Austria hungry for their own ethnicity-based independent nations example Czechs, Slovaks, Germans, poles
Therefore, the Habsburg dynasty was against the idea of Yugoslavia
Russian anxieties
Straits of Dardanelles provided an exit to Russian trade from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.
Therefore, freedom of navigation in these straits was crucial for Russia
On the east of these states there was the ottoman empire a traditional rival of Russia and on the west, there was the Balkan peninsula.
Serbia was an ally of Russia as the Romanoff dynasty was also a Slavic dynasty therefore Russia wanted a strong Serbia as a strong ally in the Balkan peninsula
Germany was a rival of Russia and a strong ally of Austria hungry therefore was supported Austria hungry to establish domination over the Balkan peninsula which made Russia anxious for freedom of navigation in the straits also Germany influenced the ottoman empire
Therefore, the above factors contributed to world war 1
However Instead of multiple bilateral wars these conflicts merged into a single world war due to the existence of alliances in Europe
Triple entente – it and Britain, France, and Russia.
France and Russia had a military alliance against Germany since 1894
France and Britain ended their colonial conflicts via entente cordiale 1904 and established a treaty of friendship.
Britain and Russia signed the birria Russia agreement in 1907 whereby Russia agreed to Tibet, Afghanistan, and India as British spheres of influence. This ended Britain Russia rivalry over India (1878- lord Lytton fought 2nd Afghan war against Russia
Iran was divided into three zones north Iran was to be spare of influence of Russia plus central Iran was to be a buffer from Britain.
Agreement also included a trade and investment agreement also included trade and investment agreement.
Reasons for agreement -the first Russian revolution of 1905 that followed the defeat of Russia in Russo Japanese war in 1904-1905.
IMPACT of the triple entente.
TRIPLE alliance (Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary)
Italy switched sides and fought and entered WW1 in 1915 on side of allied powers because of bribe territories post-war victory by allied powers.

EVENTS in world war-1 (10:15 AM)

Morocco crisis 1906
Britain Russia agreement 1907
Bosnian crisis 1909
Bosnia was part of the ottoman empire however under the domination of Austria hungry
Ottoman empire was a weak multiethnic empire with a weak central government of Khalifa (the religious head of the Muslim world)

And a weak non-industrialized economy and weak military

Bosnia was populated by Slavs therefore desired by Serbia for Yugoslavia.
In 1908 Austria hungry annexed Bosnia leading to tensions with Serbia
Russia called a conference but Britain France did not attain it as they feared that Germany would go to war for Austria-Hungary If the issue escalated.
Russia felt humiliated and began militarization so it could support Serbia in the future.
Therefore, tensions in Europe escalated
AGADIR crisis 1911
Tensions between Germany on one side and Britain and France on the other side
Balkan war 1912
Turkey was attacked by Montenegro, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and the ottoman empire lost its territories in Balkan.
However, Serbia was not given Albania which was created as an independent country.
Serbia felt that it was because of Germans who were allies of Austria hungry with no Albania Serbia continued to not have access to the sea.
2nd Balkan war 1913
Bulgaria was unhappy with territorial redistribution after the first Balkan war.
This war was fought between Bulgaria vs Greece Romania, Serbia, and turkey. Bulgaria lost the war.
British did not come to the aid of Serbia; therefore, Germany also did not come to the aid of Bulgaria and the Germans developed the perception that the British will not participate in future wars
Assassination Archduke Austria Franz Ferdinand of Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia was killed in a terrorist attack by Bosnians but Austria Hungary blamed Serbia and gave demands and soon threatened Serbia with war
This Austria Hungary vs Serbia war got converted into World War -1 due to the alliance system.
Russia declared military support for Serbia if Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia.
Germany declared military support for Austria-Hungary if Russia supported Serbia.
Germany miscalculated that Russia would not enter the war due to fear of Germany. That is to prevent the war with Germany.
Russia did not demobilize its army despite the ultimatum by Germany.
Germany miscalculated/assumed that France would come to the military to aid Russia due to the 1894 military alliance of France with Russia and that Britain Would not participate in war.
Therefore, Germany signed an alliance with the ottoman empire and Austria-Hungary and declared war on Serbia, Russia, France, and Belgium.
Germany miscalculated that it would defeat France in six weeks if Germany attacked France via Belgium (Schlieffen plan)
Britain an ally of Belgium declared war on Germany and its allies
Japan an ally of Britain declared war on Germany and its allies because wanted German pacific islands.
Italy joined allied powers in 1915 because of bribes of territories post-victory.
Bulgaria joined central powers as an ally of Germany.
Therefore, Austria-Hungary vs Serbia converted into a world war.

Highlights and events of WORLD War -1 (11:20 AM)

Schlieffen plan for Germany failed
Germany did not want a prolonged two-front war and assumed that France would enter the war in favor of Russia.
As per this plan the German military would defeat France in six weeks by encircling it by attacking it via Belgium therefore a quick victory would lead to a quick end of two fronts.
However, the plan failed.
Belgium was defeated was there was a stalemate in France due to trench warfare.
Trench warfare
French and German armies dig trenches and war continued for years.
Poor hygiene and sanitation in trenches. Therefore, trenches become the source of diseases.
It is argued that Spanish flue may have originated in trenches
Spanish flue did not originate in Spain however Spain was first to admit the existence of the virus because allied powers and central powers did not want to demoralize their soldiers.
Many died in trenches and later books were written on the misery of life in trenches.
Germanies unrestricted submarine warfare 1917.
By 1916 German navy lost to the British navy in the war on the sea surface.
Therefore, now as a last resort, Germany began unrestricted submarine warfare. That is targeting all surface vessels without verification of their identity this led to the entry of the USA in World War -1
Why the US joined allied powers in 1917 in world war-1
Blockade by allied powers and Germany to prevent access of supplies to the enemy hurt the US trade.
Then unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany led to the destruction of US Marchant vessels and the death of US citizens.
Zimmerman Plan of Germany.
Germans were aware that their USW (unrestricted submarine warfare) would lead to the entry of the USA on side of allied powers.
Therefore, they wanted to delay US entry.
As per Zimmerman’s plan Germany planned to instigate a war between US and Mexico. So US gets busy in local war (1913 Madero of Mexico overthrown by USA (CIA)
Once the US came to know about this plan the US was more determined to defeat Germany
Other aspects of Zimmerman plan-( 1) supply arms to Indian revolutionaries (Bagha Jatin Mukherjee) to create tension for Britain in India 2) transport Lenin from Switzerland to Russia to instigate a civil war or revolution in Russia
After the February revolution of 1917 Russia was no more monarchy therefore the US was more comfortable joining a war.
Impact of US joining the war
Once US joined the war the defeat of central powers was inevitable.
In Nov 1918 German army surrendered and an armistice was signed in France.

WHY Germany lost WW-1 (12:00 PM)

Britain was the top European power with colonial empowerment. It raised armies from colonies as well.
The US was the top economic power by 1914
France had also a big colonial empire hence resources
Therefore, the longer the war lesser the chances of German victory and failed to get quick victories did not come. Example Schlieffen plan failed
Weal alliance member of Germany.
Britain was the top naval power
Italy switched sides and joined allied powers.
Arabs in the ottoman empire began a civil war against the ottoman empire under the leadership of British officer P. E Lawrence in the hope of a promise by Britain of Independence after the defeat of central powers. Therefore, the Ottoman empire further weakened.
