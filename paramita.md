The paramitas (Sanskrit), or paramis (Pali), translated as “perfections” or “transcendent virtues,” are a collection of qualities Buddhists strive to cultivate. A popular teaching in many Buddhist traditions, the perfections are most commonly associated with bodhisattvas seeking to perfect themselves and become buddhas. 
Mahayana traditions, such as Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, typically list six perfections:
1. Generosity (dana)
2. Morality (sila)
3. Patience (ksanti)
4. Energy (virya)
5. Meditation (dhyana/samadhi)
6. wisdom (prajna)

Pāramitā (Sanskrit, Pali: पारमिता) or pāramī (Pāli: पारमी), is a Buddhist term often translated as "perfection". It is described in Buddhist commentaries as noble character qualities generally associated with enlightened beings. Pāramī and pāramitā are both terms in Pali but Pali literature makes greater reference to pāramī, while Mahayana texts generally use the Sanskrit pāramitā.
