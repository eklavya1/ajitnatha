1. POLITY AND GOVERNANCE
1.1. DIGITAL RIGHTS
Why in News?

European Commission, in a global first,
proposed a set of digital rights and principles
recently.

More on News
• It is an extension of the Berlin
declaration on Digital Society and Value-
Based Digital Government of EU council.

o Declaration aims to contribute to a
value-based digital transformation
by addressing and ultimately
strengthening digital participation
and digital inclusion in our societies.

• Aim is to
o Protect people's rights, support
democracy and ensure a fair and safe
online environment.

o Provide a guide for policymakers
and companies when dealing with
new technologies.

o Promote these principles as a
standard for the world countries.

• Principles outlined are (refer image)
About Digital Rights
• Digital rights, closely linked to freedom of expression and privacy, are those that allow people to access, use, create
and publish digital media, as well as access and use computers, other electronic devices and communications
networks.

• Digital rights are merely an extension of the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the
United Nations as applied to the online world.

• It is a broad term implying right to privacy and data protection; it can be related to trolling, online threats and hate
speech; it can address broader issues of equitable Internet access regardless of economic backgrounds and
disabilities.

Need for Digital Rights
• Protection of privacy and control of personal data as governments, companies and cyber criminals can easily collect
our personal data and track our movements and communications.

• Digital transformation of businesses by supporting MSMEs and entrepreneurs in harvesting the benefits of the digital
transformation including fair and secure access to data.

• Enhancing trust of individuals whether as students, learners, workers, jobseekers, consumers etc. in digital ecosystem
to stimulate their involvement in a fair, sustainable, inclusive, democratic and competitive digital transformation.

• Supporting workers in adjusting to changes brought on by digitalisation to the labour market, including their working
conditions, wellbeing, while being able to reap its opportunities, notably through education, training and re-skilling.

• Tackling Pandemics as COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the fact that connectivity, access to data and digital
technologies are a vital resource for governmental, educational, research, economic activity and innovation and will
be central for the recovery efforts, including social and societal well-being.

www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS

• Aligning R&D initiatives with the infrastructure and digitalization plans, thus promoting fundamental and applied
research, enhancing the links between civil society, academia, the public and the private sector.

• Supporting isolated, remote, low density, low-income and outermost regions and communities in the digital
transformation process in order to improve territorial cohesion, digital inclusion and local economic development.

• Promoting digital democracy by Promoting children’s participation, Promoting women’s and girls’ participation and
leadership, Ensuring the rule of law online through equal access to justice etc.

• Promoting responsible and secure data management by the public and private sector and promoting cybersecurity
awareness to equip all citizens with knowledge of how to use Internet and digital technologies.

Concerns/Challenges faced to avail Digital Rights
• Digital Divide: Lack of connectivity or inadequate digital skills can lead to the creation of a new divide between the
connected and digitized people, business and regions and those who remain disconnected and not-digitized.

• Vulnerable to misuse: Digitalization also bears the risk of deepening existing inequalities or being misused to
undermine democracies, spread dangerous misinformation and fuel discrimination, xenophobia and racism.

• Rising inequalities: Digital technology can also worsen economic and other inequalities. In 2019, close to 87 per cent
of individuals in developed countries used the Internet, compared with only 19 per cent in the least developed
countries.

• Privacy issue: Data-intensive technologies contribute to creating a digital environment to track, analyze, predict and
even manipulate people’s behavior to an unprecedented degree thereby posing significant risks for human dignity,
autonomy and privacy.

• Digitally facilitated repression: Authoritarian governments now have enhanced capacities to censor expression, block
or filter access to information, monitor online activity, and control populations than they did in the pre-digital world.

• Violation of human rights: Use of digital technologies to surveil or crack down on protesters can lead to human rights
violations, including infringement of the right to peaceful assembly.

• Lack of focus on Child rights: Policy approach to

infrastructure, data flows, R&D and secure and trustworthy online services.

• Recognising the importance of green and digital technologies, as a key element to a new paradigm of economic
growth, balancing innovation and competitiveness with social and environmental sustainable development.

• Establish a data protection agency: dedicated to privacy and data protection, oversight, and enforcement, with the
authority and resources to address emerging privacy challenges.

1.2. ONLINE CAMPAIGNING
Why in News?

Due to the ongoing pandemic and associated health risks, recently EC put temporal restrictions on physical rallies for
upcoming state elections while allowing virtual campaigns through social media platforms.

About online election campaigning
• Election campaigns are the means by which candidates and political parties prepare and present their ideas and
positions on issues to the voters.

• Online campaign not only includes promoting political and electoral campaign material on social media platforms
such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, it also includes reaching out to voters with audio message, phone calls,
videos and LED screen-mounted vans from small town to remote villages.

• The preferred modes of election messaging include audio-video animation with text, and digital banner and posters
for targeted assembly constituencies.

Concerns
raised
against
online
campaigning
• Regulation of online campaigning:
Monitoring of e-Campaign and other
applicable rules (election silence on
days before election, Opinion polls,
exit polls etc) will be a challenge due
to limited EC resources and diverse
social media platform.

• Transparency concern: Social media
platforms might favour a specific
party and accord prominence to its
content over others through its
algorithms. Bots are being used for
targeted disinformation campaigns.

• Campaigning on wedge issues: In
online
campaigning,
candidates/parties are more likely to
campaign on wedge issue such as
matters on immigration and welfare
as messages are being played out
largely in secret.

• Tracking the source of financing:
Expenditure on campaigns run from
outside the country can pose serious
challenges for regulating expenditure as well as for message dissemination.

• Role of intermediaries: Methods used to curate and

• Digital divide: There still exists a massive digital divide in India and a digital election means that the poor and the
lower castes will be at a disadvantageous position compared to the urban, middle and richer classes, and the upper
castes.

• Privacy: An online sphere where every conversation, comment or post is recorded and can be analysed for its
commercial and political use could have negative repercussions on privacy and free expression and exchange of
views.

• Other Concerns: Monitoring proxies used by political parties; control hateful campaigns, fake news etc.

Way forward
• Personal data: Use of personal data in the context of electoral campaigns should be scrutinised by relevant agencies
in collaboration with EC to ensure that it complies with national laws.

• Responsibility of social media platforms: to store the relevant recordings from the campaigns to enable EC to review
any complaints regarding violation of the Model Code of Conduct.

• Update regulation methods: This should include selection of media for monitoring (content monitoring); revision of
spending monitoring, and transparency and data requirements for platforms and intermediaries.

• Maintain a level playing field in political campaigns. There is a need for new and innovative measures to ensure that
new, less well resourced, and minority political campaigns can be heard should be sought.

• Self-regulatory bodies in journalism should be encouraged to collaborate with internet intermediaries for fact
checking independently from the state, and also to prevent deliberate misinformation likely to impact electoral
processes.

Related news
Election Commission has enhanced the existing election expenditure limit for candidates in Parliamentary and Assembly
constituencies.

• Reasons cited: substantial increase in the number of electors, Cost Inflation Index for the hike etc.

• Expenditure limit for Lok Sabha constituencies has been raised from 70 lakh to 95 lakh rupees in bigger states and 54 lakh to
75 lakhs in smaller states.

• For Assembly constituencies, expenditure limits have been enhanced from 28 lakh rupees 40 lakh rupees in bigger states and
from 20 lakhs to 28 lakhs in smaller states.

Election Commission of India (ECI) postponed Punjab Assembly polls
• The move comes following the request to ECI to postpone the election in view of Guru Ravidas Jayanti celebrations.

• Under Section 153 of the Representation of the People Act 1951, the ECI can “extend the time” for completing an election.

o However, such extension should not go beyond the date of the normal dissolution/term of the House (Lok Sabha or State
Assembly).

• Term of the House can only be extended in an emergency declared by Parliament.

o Constitution restricts this emergency to only two situations — war and breakdown of law and order.

• EVMs were first used
in Parur Assembly
Constituency of Kerala
in the year 1982.

• Use of EVMs in an
election is legal. In
1988, a new Section
61A was inserted in the
Representation of the
People
Act,
1951
empowering ECI to use
electronic
voting
machines.

• An EVM being
used
by ECI can record a
maximum of 2,000 votes.

• EVMs can cater to a maximum of 64 candidates (including NOTA). There is provision for 16 candidates in one Balloting
Unit.

• The arrangement of names of candidates in the ballot paper is in alphabetical order, first candidates from national
political parties’ figure and then from other state registered parties.

Concerns raised against EVMs
• Susceptibility to fraud: many software programmers have claimed that EVMs are vulnerable to malicious
programming and if it gets affected then any hacker can hack the machine and can tamper the vote counts easily.

• Global precedence: German constitutional court ruling (2009) forced the country to scrap EVMs and return to paper
ballot. Other technologically advanced nations such as the Netherlands and Ireland have also abandoned EVMs.

• Lack of secrecy: With the paper ballot, ballots from all the booths were mixed up before counting so that the
candidates could not get any idea about which booths voted for or against them. In the case of EVMs, the candidates
know how they fared in each booth, and this knowledge can be misused by a candidate.

• Storage and Counting concerns: EVMs are stored in a decentralized manner in different locations. Security experts
say that voting machines must remain in a secure environment throughout their life cycle.

Conclusion
Time and again political parties have cast doubts on EVMs, alleging they can be hacked or tampered with and thereby
questioning the credibility of EVMs.

In electoral democracies, free and fair elections convert voters’ preferences into a political mandate that forms the basis
for policymaking. More precise and efficient voting procedures boost the strength of democratic institutions.

EC should address the concerns raised by various stakeholders and should bring in more transparency regarding credibility
of EVMs in conducting free and fair elections.

www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


ECI initiatives to improve EVMs credibility
• Use of VVPAT machines along with the EVMs in all polling
stations to bring utmost transparency and credibility.

• ECI has also taken into account suggestions made by various
political parties regarding counting of VVPAT slips and will count
VVPAT slips up to a definite percentage.

• ECI held a challenge and offered opportunity to political parties
to demonstrate that EVMs can be tampered.

• EC ensures continuous participation of all parties in all crucial
steps during elections such as First Level Checking (FLC),
randomisation of EVMs/VVPATs, mock poll, EVM sealing and
storage etc.

1.4. LOCAL RESERVATION IN PRIVATE SECTOR
Why in news?

The Haryana government has challenged in Supreme Court, the order by the Punjab & Haryana High Court, to halt 75%
quota in private jobs for locals.

More on news
• The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, came into force on January 15, 2022.

• It provides for 75% reservation to local youngsters in private sector jobs that offered a monthly salary of less
than ₹30,000. It covers private companies, societies, trusts and partnership firms.

• Haryana is not the first state in India to push for such a move. Others like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka
and Madhya Pradesh have already tried to reserve private jobs for locals. But, all of them have run into hurdles.

Arguments in support of local reservation in private sector
• Step to provide right to employment: The Haryana government had argued that the law merely makes “geographical
classification”, which is permitted under the Constitution. It is to protect the right to life/livelihood of people
domiciled in the state and to protect their health, living condition and their right to employment.

• Dealing with shrinking employment opportunities: According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE),
Haryana’s unemployment rate has been in excess of the national average since the past four years. In April 2020,
around 40% of job seekers from the state returned empty-handed.

o Industrialisation and urbanisation in the state of Haryana has led to huge land acquisition which resultantly has
reduced growth and employment opportunities in the agriculture sector.

• Curbing the selectively discriminating corporations: Many business entities reluctant to employ local workers.

Employers believe the local workers lack work discipline, are unwilling to learn new trades, are inclined towards
political and trade unions — seen as pressure tactics by businesses.

• Skewed Resource Allocation: With successive Finance Commissions according a higher weightage to poverty and
population vis-a-vis development, States like Bihar and UP end up receiving a generous share of the resources pie.

9
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


This would seem to deprive the income-generating States of the resources needed to manage a growing migrant
population, while not incentivising the poorer States to get their act together.

o For example, the gap between the per capita incomes of, say, Bihar and Tamil Nadu has not narrowed over the
last decade. In 2015-16, Bihar’s per capita net State domestic product at constant prices was ₹24,572, against
Tamil Nadu’s ₹1.11 lakh.

Arguments against local reservation in private sector
• In contravention of the Constitution: The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in
Haryana was in contravention of Article 14 and Article 16 of the Constitution pertaining to Right to Equality and
Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any
occupation, trade or business.

• Fuels sons-of-the-soil syndrome: Employment is one of the principal factors behind migration and shutting the doors
on employment to non-domiciles would be a gross violation of not just the Fundamental Rights of citizens but would
also open a Pandora box where other states follow the same.

• Stifle the labour market: Such reservation may push businesses to migrate, as their skilled workforce is not sufficiently
‘local’. Additionally, the smaller entities may find it difficult to carry on, once the new law comes into force as their
compliance costs may rise.

• Revival of license raj: Many experts believe that allowing reservations in the private sector would be akin to
nationalization of the private sector and it would result in the revival of license-raj.

• No solution to core issues:
o Skewed geographical development: Investors prefer to stick to States where a governance ecosystem (which
includes a level of social infrastructure such as education and health) is already in place. This institutional deficit
needs to be addressed.

o Low quality of education and skills.

Related information on the issue of legislation for “sons of the soil”
The Madhya Pradesh government in 2020 reserved all government jobs for “children of the state” . This raised questions relating
to the fundamental right to equality.

• Constitutional provisions on the issue of legislation for “sons of the soil”
o Article 16: Guarantees equal treatment under law in matters of public employment & prohibits the state from
discriminating on grounds of place of birth or residence.

o Article 16(2): “No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of
them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect or, any employment or office under the State”.

▪ The provision is supplemented by the other clauses in the Constitution that guarantee equality.

o Article 16 (3): It provides an
exception by saying that Parliament
may make a law “prescribing” a
requirement of residence for jobs
in a particular state. This power
vests solely in the Parliament, not
state legislatures.

o Why does the Constitution prohibit
reservation based on domicile?

▪ As
India
has
common
citizenship, which gives citizens
the liberty to move around
freely in any part of the
country, the requirement of a
place of birth or residence
cannot be qualifications for
granting public employment in
any state.

• Bridging the regional inequalities: the rise in regional inequalities (east vis-a-vis west and south) since the 1990s has
deepened social divisions, with migration largely headed towards the western and southern States where
infrastructure is better developed. The setting up of educational and skills institutions in backward areas can bridge
the gap. These regions can turn into hubs of economic activity. This, in turn, will check the advance of parochial
economics.

• Promote labour intensive industries: More job creation and industrialization would make use of the labour surplus
in the country.

• Focus on education and skilling: There is need to invest more in education, health and skill development. The
medium-term spin-offs from that could be an enhancement in the quality of public goods which in turn would attract
investors, create jobs and boost incomes.

• Incentive’s route: Governments should provide incentives to industries for more investments and create an enabling
environment for employing local people.

Disputed border with China
• Border is not clearly demarcated throughout and there is no mutually agreed Line of Actual Control (LAC).

o LAC is the demarcation that separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory. India
considers the LAC to be 3,488 km long, while the Chinese consider it to be only around 2,000 km.

INDIA-SRI LANKA-CHINA
TRIANGLE
Why in news?

China’s growing presence in Sri Lanka is
generating concerns about the Indo-Sri
Lanka bilateral relationship.


How China’s influence is rising in Sri
Lanka?

Over the last few years, Chinese footprint has
increased dramatically in the island nation with
China providing economic, cultural, military and
technical assistance to Sri Lanka.

How the growing clout of China affects India-Sri
Lanka bilateral relationship?

• Threat to maritime security: A permanent
People's Liberation Army (PLA) presence in the
eastern Indian Ocean will certainly inhibit the
Indian Navy’s deployment options and will
neutralise the geographical advantage it enjoys in
these waters.

o For instance, recently, Sri Lanka has approved

17
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


o For instance, Last year, Indian government took five months to approve a loan moratorium sought by Colombo
while Beijing approved an additional US $500 million loan from its development bank in no time.

• Impact on trade: The recent import restrictions policy imposed by the Sri Lankan government to control foreign
currency outflows does not seem to have affected China as much as it impacted India. Chinese imports were reduced
by 8 percent in 2020, while in contrast, imports from India went down by approximately 19 percent.

o For instance, the availability of textile raw materials, such as yarn and fabric, at a low price from Chinese suppliers
is the major reason for Sri Lanka to import these goods from China instead of from India or Pakistan, which
previously used to be major importers of textile materials to Sri Lanka.

India-Sri Lanka Relations
Areas of Cooperation
• Political: The 2020 virtual summit issued a joint statement “Mitratva Magga”
covering all areas of bilateral relations.

• Economic: Sri Lanka remains among the largest trade partners of India in SAARC.

• Cultural: Buddhism, spread by Ashoka is one of the strong pillars connecting both
Nations. Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Scheme, Study in India
tourism etc also played their part in strengthening cultural connect between the
two nations.

• Development Projects: Sri Lanka is India’s one of the major development partners.

For e.g. India housing Project in Sri Lanka.

• Military Exercises: MITRA, SHAKTI, IN-SLN etc.

Recent developments
• India inks deal with Sri Lanka to jointly develop Trincomalee
oil tank farm.

• Renewable energy projects and investments in information
technology in Sri Lanka by India.

• Credit lines for fuel and food.

• India and Sri Lanka extended the existing S&T cooperation for
3 more years, with focus on new areas like waste-water
technologies, biotech, sustainable agriculture, big data etc.

• India provided a $ 400 m credit swap facility to Sri Lanka and
deferred Asian Clearing House settlement of $515.2 million.

• Sri Lankan government prepared a roadmap to repair its ties
with India.

Way ahead to reinvigorate India-Sri Lanka Ties
As close friends and maritime neighbours, both India and Sri Lanka stand to gain from closer economic interlinkages.

• Exploring new domains: In education, healthcare, and tourism, India is a far stronger partner than China.

• Leveraging India’s Soft Power: In the technology sector, India could create job opportunities by expanding the
presence of its information technology companies in Sri Lanka thereby boosting the island nation’s service economy.

• Sharing experience: As Sri Lanka embarks on the arduous project of drafting a constitution, India can lend its own
experience in managing minority rights and diverse populations.

• Strengthening cultural relations: The two countries can look to create a Buddhism knowledge and tourism corridor.

o India recently announced US $15 million grant for promotion of Buddhist ties with Sri Lanka.

• Cooperation in maritime security: As maritime countries in the Indian Ocean, India and Sri Lanka have a shared
interest in ensuring maritime security and safety.

India-Israel Bilateral Relations: Areas of Cooperation
• Political Relations: Full diplomatic relations were
established in 1992, which were upgraded to a strategic
level in 2017. Increased high-level exchanges and ministerial
visits on both sides have expanded cooperation in different
functional areas.

o Recently India and Israel along with US and UAE formed
the ‘New Quad’ or the ‘Middle-Eastern Quad’ to work
on furthering the economic and political ties between
the four countries.

• Economic and Commercial Relations
o Bilateral merchandise trade: US$ 5.6 billion (excluding
defence) in 2018-19 (grew by 30 times since 1992) , with
the balance of trade being in India’s favour.

o India is Israel's third largest trade partner in Asia and
seventh largest globally.

o Trade in diamonds constitutes close to 40% of bilateral
trade. In recent years, the bilateral trade
has diversified into several sectors such as
pharmaceuticals,
agriculture,
IT
and
telecom, and homeland security.

o India has benefited from Israeli expertise

from Israel along with joint production and
development of key defence items such as

o Joint Working Group on Counter-
Terrorism.

o Agreements on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, Cooperation in Homeland Security, and Protection

• Culture and Education
o India is known in Israel as an ancient nation with strong cultural traditions and is an attractive, alternative tourist
destination.

o New funding programme of joint academic research has been launched with the University Grants Commission
and the Israel Science Foundation as nodal organizations.

o Two countries share values of democracy and pluralism. We also share some of our guiding civilizational
philosophies: Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam in India, or the world is one family, and Tikun Olam in Israel, or heal the
world.

• Indian Community
o There are approximately 85,000 Jews of Indian-origin in Israel (majority is from Maharashtra).

o On the other hand, the Jewish diaspora in India coexisted peacefully in India for hundreds of years and
contributed in the nation building process and enriching India's literature and arts.


19
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


Areas of Concern
• Radicalism and terrorism: India has been facing major threats emanating from across the border from Pakistan and
Israel is also surrounded by hostile neighbours such as Palestine and Lebanon.

• Trade and investment potential is not harnessed fully: Trade is mainly confined to diamonds and defence. Free Trade
Agreement talks are stagnated for more than a decade. The Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) signed in 1996 was also
terminated later due to differences between the two countries dampening the investment climate.

• Emerging fissures in the West Asian region: With Israel and Saudi Arabia coming close with an aim to stop the rise of
Iran, it will be tough for India to balance its relations with the three main poles of the West Asian region.

• Human Rights violation by Israel against Palestine: India has been vocal about human rights violations, however
India faces strategic dilemma in dealing with the issue. For instance, recently, India abstained on the resolution that
calls on the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to set up a permanent commission to probe human rights violations
in Gaza, West Bank and Palestine.

• Connectivity between two countries is still poor which has led to limited people to people ties.

• Israel’s close ties with China: China is the second largest trading partner of Israel. Also, Israel is the second largest
weapon supplier to China and recently agreed to take part in China’s One Belt -One Road Initiative.

Way ahead for strengthening the relationship
• Enhancing people to people connect: There is a strong need to use soft power diplomacy to build people-to-people
bridges and to add to economic benefits through robust inter-country tourism.

• Education: India’s world-class institutes of higher

Programme budget. Withdrawal of any of these major donors leaves an immediate, substantial funding gap that
cannot be bridged easily due to the very limited amounts of sustainable, flexible and predictable financing.

o For instance, U.S. funding had declined by 25 percent during the COVID pandemic.

• To make long-term planning possible and to strengthen WHO’s ability to deliver on work to lead and coordinate
global health.

Conclusion
COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the fundamental importance of the global detection, response and coordination roles
that only WHO can play across all Member States. But delivery on this mission relies on WHO itself being in sound financial
health. Committing to the more sustainable financing of WHO is to invest in a healthier and safer world for all of us.

2.5. UKRAINE CRISIS
Why in News?

Recently, The United States has warned Russia not to invade Ukraine and
urged both countries to return to a set of agreements designed to end a
separatist war by Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine.

More in News
• Over the past several months, Russia has amassed more than 100,000
troops at Ukraine's eastern border and, according to U.S. officials,
mounted an aggressive influence campaign.

o Its actions have prompted concerns among Western and
Ukrainian officials that an invasion could occur.

• However, Russia denies that it is planning to invade Ukraine and says
its deployment of troops and equipment close to the borders is an
exercise.

Background
• In 2013, Ukraine's then-President, Viktor Yanukovich, decided against signing an association agreement (AA) with
the European Union (EU), sparking major pro-European protests in Ukraine.

• In February 2014, the Ukrainian parliament voted to impeach Yanukovich, who fled Kyiv.

• Subsequently, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong
Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens.

from Kiev, prompting months of heavy fighting.

o However, efforts to reach a diplomatic settlement and satisfactory resolution have been unsuccessful.

▪ A major blockage has been Russia’s insistence that it is not a party to the conflict and therefore is not bound

• Global peace: The conflict has
heightened tensions in Russia’s relations with both the United States and Europe, complicating the prospects for
cooperation elsewhere including on issues of terrorism, arms control, and a political solution in Syria.

Concerns for India due to Ukraine crisis
• To maintain balance between Russia and US: India has good relations with both Russia and the US and siding with
one of these countries could cost India its relationship with the other.

o However, India has maintained its neutrality from distant conflict in Eastern Europe. Indian government has
abstained from the procedure vote on Ukraine at the UN Security Council.

▪ India’s position on the ongoing Ukraine crisis undergirded by the desire to keep clear of the crosshairs of big
power rivalry is reminiscent of its quintessential ‘strategic autonomy’.

• S-400 delivery and US waiver: The crisis comes precisely as India’s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system is
under way- and India hopes for a waiver of U.S. sanctions on this. Conflict will complicate both the delivery of the
system, and the possibility of a presidential waiver.

• Brings Russia China closer: The Crisis will make Moscow more dependent on friends like China and build a regional
bloc of sorts that India is not a part of.

o Russia is already averse to the Indo-Pacific concept and the Quad as a revival of Cold War bloc politics and views
them as being against its Asia-Pacific interests. Any Ukraine conflict and a resulting breakdown of Russia-West ties
will strengthen Russian opposition to these concepts and forums which are binding us to the US.

• India’s Investment in Russia: India’s plans in Russia’s energy sector and in the development of its Far East, in general,
would become problematic, especially by the reluctance of the private sector to fall afoul of the complex US sanctions.

The new sanctions could exclude Russia from the Swift payments system.

Conclusion
For many analysts, the conflict marked a clear shift in the global security environment from a unipolar period of U.S.

dominance to one defined by renewed competition between great powers. However, a solution to the conflict is at hand,
in the form of the Minsk II agreement of 2015 calling for autonomy for a demilitarized Donbas within Ukraine, under
international guarantees.

3. ECONOMY
3.1. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) ESTIMATES
Why in News?

Recently, the National Statistical
Office (NSO) released the first
advance estimates of GDP for
2021-22 with GDP growth rate
pegged at 9.2%.

More on News
• First Advance Estimates of
GDP were introduced in 2016-
17 to serve as essential inputs
to the Budget exercise.

• It uses the Benchmark-
indicator
method
i.e. ,
extrapolating previous year
estimates by using relevant
indicators on performance of
different sectors of economy.

• Key Estimates (Base year for Constant Prices- 2011-12):
○ Real GDP is estimated to grow at 9.2% and Nominal GDP at 17.6%,
○ Real GVA is estimated to grow at 8.6% and Nominal GVA at 17.4%.

Why is measurement of GDP important?

Calculated through different approaches (Production, Expenditure and Income), GDP data became the primary yardstick
for sizing up a country’s economy during World War II.

• Amalgamation of traditional economic indicators: Based on empirical analysis, the classical economists link higher
GDP growth with higher individual satisfaction as it represents increasing satisfaction (utility), higher jobs etc.

o E.g., Okun’s Law suggests a linear relation between unemployment and GDP with every 3-point rise in GDP
leading to 1 percentage point fall in unemployment.

• Acts as a marker of growth: GDP enables policymakers and central banks to judge whether the economy is contracting
or expanding and promptly take necessary action.

o It is believed that high GDP growth will trickle down to people at the bottom of the ladder, i.e., the poorest
people will gradually benefit as a result of increasing wealth of the richest.

• Used to analyze the impact of variable: It also allows policymakers, economists, and businesses to analyze the impact
of variables such as monetary and fiscal policy, economic shocks, and tax and spending plans.

Limitations of GDP Statistics
GDP statistics have evolved with time to resolve various issues. Still, GDP is not an appropriate measure of the overall
standard of living or well-being of a country’s development. It suffers from statistical limitations and other concerns
which limit GDP data utility to measure development such as:
Statistical
• Nature of Statistics: Statistics lag behind the actual happening in the economy, increasing time to capture and

understand the major structural change. E.g.

o In India, the most accurate GDP data, i.e., revised estimates comes after a lag of almost 3 years.

o Much of the Digital Economy isn’t part of it due to investment in intangibles (e.g. software, brand equity,
innovation or R&D etc.)

• Capturing Unpaid Work: GDP statistics fail to capture the unpaid labour (e.g., childcare), limiting GDP and its
use to compare between countries.

major economies. These inequalities are further pushed by the recent pandemic.

o E.g., According to Oxfam Inequality report 2021, ‘Inequality Kills’, 84% Indian households had a decline
in income while wealth of 100 richest people more than doubled. The share of the bottom 50% was
merely 6% of national wealth and over 4.6 crore Indians fell into extreme poverty in 2020.

• Environment Impact: Focus on economic growth leads to serious undermining of environment and resource
exploitation, leading to environmental degradation.

• Weak relationship between money and well-being: People’s sense of well-being is governed not just by
money but other factors as well.

o It includes factors like personal and family relationships, physical and mental health, security, and
satisfaction at work etc.

What can be the additional indicators to measure well-being more effectively?

With growth still a key policy target, GDP helps to measure
economic performance and guide policy making for efficient use of
available resources. At the same time, its limitations on well-being
and problems caused by using growth alone as indicator has
motivated indicators such as:
• Gross National Happiness (GNH): Coined by the 4th king of
Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck in the 1970’s, GNH focuses
on four pillars- good governance, sustainable socio-economic
development, cultural preservation and environmental
conservation.

• Human Development Index (HDI): Launched in 1990 by the
United Nations (developed by Mahbub ul Haq) to measure
factors such as education, income, and health.

• Bare Necessities Index (BNI): Introduced by the Finance
Ministry in 2020-21, it assesses the fulfillment of bare
necessities of life such as housing, water sanitation, electricity
etc.

• Green GDP: Also known as environmentally adjusted domestic product, it allows the cost of natural resource
depletion and environmental degradation to be subtracted from GDP.

o Gross Environment Product: A component of Green GDP, it measures the ecosystem services or the benefits
derived from natural resources and processes such as food, clean water etc.

• Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI): Used to measure the economic growth of a nation, GPI takes into account the GDP
as well as its negative social and environmental costs such as crimes, resource depletion, etc.

Conclusion
Though each of them had their own criticism over methodology or other reasons, they can complement GDP dataset for
a wider set of objectives. In essence, the most appropriate measure of well-being would be a combination of reduced
inequality, well-being of people, systemic resilience and environmental sustainability alongside economic growth.

holders done under the retail direct scheme.

o Dated securities: Long-term instruments, which mature
anywhere between 5 years and 40 years.

Retail participation in G-sec: Background
• In the Union Budget for FY 2021-22, the government proposed to consolidate various statutory Acts like the
Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Act, 1992, and the Government Securities Act 2007, etc. into a rationalised
single securities markets code.

• Consequently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed retail investors to participate in the government securities
(G-Sec) market (both primary and secondary) through ‘Retail Direct’, an online portal for trading.

o India became the third country, after the US and Brazil, in enacting such a provision.

• Though, the RBI has been allowing small investors to participate in G-Sec market since 2001, it has not gained
significant traction and is mostly confined to institutional investors as it is a high-volume game and specialised in
nature.

• In November 2021, RBI came up with Retail Direct scheme.

About Retail Direct scheme
• It is a one-stop solution to facilitate investment in Government Securities by Individual Investors.

• Under the scheme, retail investors can buy G-Sec directly and free of cost. Earlier investors could buy government
securities through gilt mutual funds.

• The scheme provides the following facilities to retail investors in government securities market through an online
portal:
o Open and maintain a ‘Retail Direct Gilt Account’ (RDG Account);
o Access to primary issuance of Government securities;
o Access to NDS-OM.

• Non-Resident retail investors eligible to invest in Government Securities under Foreign Exchange Management Act,
1999 are also eligible under the scheme.

• Primary market participation: Participation and allotment of securities will be as per the non-competitive scheme for
participation in primary auction of government securities.

• Secondary market transaction: Registered investors can access the secondary market transaction link on the online
portal to buy or sell government securities through NDS-OM (odd lot segment/RFQ).

30
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Providing online access to retail investors to invest in both primary and secondary government securities (G-Sec)
markets will further encourage and deepen retail investor participation in this segment.

Benefits of the scheme
• For investors: Retail investors will get a new window, in addition to the existing small savings schemes, to directly
invest in fixed income instruments with sovereign guarantee. Currently, G-sec market is dominated by institutional
investors such as banks, mutual funds, etc. which trade in lot sizes of Rs 5 crore or more.

o So, there is no liquidity in the secondary market for small investors who would want to trade in smaller lot sizes.

• For RBI: The move will help the central bank to keep down the costs of funds in light of government’s mammoth
borrowing programme of ₹12 lakh crore in 2021-22.

• For Government: Increase in the investor base will enable the government to raise resources for financing its increased budgetary spending and bridge its burgeoning fiscal deficit. It will also enable better price discovery in the
G-Sec market.

Strengthening the pillars of retail G-sec market to make it more successful
• Return on investment: Investors generally evaluate different investment options based on safety, liquidity, and ‘yield
to maturity’. Yields on G-Secs are a function of inflation, government borrowings, liquidity and volatility in the
international markets, crude oil prices, and overall risk sentiment.

o While G-Secs usually fare better in terms of safety, and offer higher yields than fixed deposits (FDs) in banks,
they provide lower after-tax returns compared to other small savings instruments such as deposits in post office,
public provident fund (PPF), SSY etc.

o Therefore, the government needs to suitably compensate the retail investors, including senior citizens, by issuing
tax-free bonds/price discounts and the like.

• Robust infrastructure: Recent outage in online digital services of HDFC Bank highlighted the need for robust trading
infrastructure, cyber security and customer protection to build confidence among the retail investors and enhance
usage of Retail-Direct.

• Financial and Digital literacy: As public awareness about G-Secs is relatively lower, Retail-Direct will be successful
when financial and digital literacy are imparted in simple, clear and Indian languages. 76 per cent of adults in India
do not even understand the basic financial concepts like interest rate, inflation, yield to maturity, etc. (Standard &
Poor’s, 2015).

3.3. UNEMPLOYMENT IN INDIA
Why in news?

India’s unemployment rate went up to 7.91 per cent in December 2021 from 6.3 per cent in 2018-2019 and 4.7 per cent

• Poor quality of jobs: According to a ILO
report (2018), while there has been a strong
job creation in some ICT- intensive services,
a significant portion of these jobs have been
in traditional low value-added services,
where informality and vulnerable forms of
employment are often dominant.

• Shrinking public sector: Government jobs, which were 19.5 million in 1996-97, were about 17 million in 2016. There
has been a decline of 89 per cent in the direct recruitment in central government ministries and departments in 2015
as compared to 2013.

o Union and state governments are either reducing posts or going for contract workers.

• Inadequate attention to small and medium enterprises (SMEs): SMEs are more labor intensive than that of large
firms. However, big companies remain the main beneficiaries of the fiscal policy of the government.

• Rise in voluntary unemployment: Voluntary unemployment refers to a situation where people choose not to work
below a certain income level after ‘investing’ in education. CMIE data based on a household survey has shown
dramatic rise in voluntary unemployment.

• Lack of employability: According to India Skills Report (ISR), less than half of the Indian graduates are employable.

In 2021, as many as 45.9 per cent of graduates are employable, a decline from 46.21 per cent in 2020 and 47.38 per

Great Resignation
• Great Resignation is an idea that predicts a large number of people leaving their jobs after the COVID pandemic ends and life
returns to normal. Thus companies have to navigate the ripple effects of the pandemic and re-evaluate how to retain talent.

• Estimates indicate that in 2021, 75.5 million people in America resigned in 2021 leading some analysts to describe this phenomenon.

• Reasons: Low salary, burnouts, limited opportunities, poor employee benefits, toxic corporate culture, instability etc.

• What can be done?: Healthy work culture, creating a better workplace by hosting more cooperate social events, providing
employees with benefits like happy hours and organising more excursions outside the office.

Few Recent initiatives taken by the central government to support workers
• Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY): Under scheme, central government contributed both 12%
employer’s share and 12% employee’s share under Employees Provident Fund (EPF).

• Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojna (ABRY) Scheme: Launched in October 2020 to incentivise employers for the
creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

• Increase in unemployment benefits: The unemployment benefit under the Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana
(launched in July 2018) was enhanced from 25% to 50% of the average earning for insured workers who have lost
employment due to COVID-19.

• Prime Minister’s Street Vendor’s Aatma Nirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme: As part of scheme, the central
government provided an initial working capital of up to Rs 10,000 to street vendors. As of June 2021, Rs 2,130 crore
disbursed to 21.57 lakh beneficiaries.

• Interlinking of databases: In Union budget 2022, it has been announced that portals such as Udyam, e-Shram, National Career Service (NCS) and Atmanirbhar Skilled Employee-Employer Mapping (ASEEM) will be interlinked to
act as live, organic databases, providing G2C, B2C and B2B services.

o These services will relate to credit facilitation, skilling, and recruitment with an aim to further formalise the
economy and enhance entrepreneurial opportunities for all.

What more can be done to overcome the challenges?

• Need of a comprehensive national employment policy: National employment policies seek to explicitly link growth
and economic strategies to employment creation and diagnose the challenges and opportunities for productive job
creation.

• Transformation of rural economy: Economic returns from States initiatives in transforming the rural economy from
traditional agriculture to more value-added activities like horticulture has been demonstrated well in states such as
Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh.

33

o Another area requiring attention is tackling the bottlenecks in the availability of business services institutions
like training, banking, insurance, storage facilities etc.

o A massive improvement in infrastructure is required to promote growth of rural industries on a sustainable
basis.

• Recommendations of Standing Committee on Labour (2021 report):
o The Committee recommended central and state governments to:
✓ Encourage entrepreneurial opportunities,
✓ Attract investment in traditional manufacturing sectors and developing industrial clusters,
✓ Strengthen social security measures,
✓ Maintain a database of workers in the informal sector, and
✓ Promote vocational training.

o To increase women participation, it recommended:
✓ Increasing government procurement from women-led enterprises,
✓ Training women in new technologies,
✓ Providing women with access to capital, and
✓ Investing in childcare and linked infrastructure.

3.4. AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS
Why in news?

According to the commerce ministry, country's agricultural exports are anticipated to exceed US$ 50 billion for the "first time" this fiscal year.

More about news
• Rice exports are expected to reach 21-22 million tonnes this year. Non-basmati rice, wheat, sugar, and other grain
exports have also seen healthy growth.

• Marine product exports are expected to exceed US$ 8 billion for the "first time" this fiscal year.

• Coffee exports have registered a healthy growth of around 35%.

• Government had taken number of steps to increase exports like:
o Extending the validity of various certifications/accreditations beyond their expiration dates;
o Establishing control rooms to handle issues;
o Issuing online certificates for exports; and
o Enabling the opening of more testing facilities.

About India’s Agricultural Exports
• Share in world trade: India has been a net exporter of agri products since the economic reforms began in 1991. As
per WTO’s Trade Statistics, share of India’s agricultural exports and imports in the world agriculture trade in 2017
was 2.27% and 1.90%, respectively.

• Share in overall domestic exports: India’s total exports have an 11 per cent contribution from agricultural and processed food products.

• Key Exported commodities: Among key agriculture commodities exported from India were marine products, basmati
rice, buffalo meat, spices, non-basmati rice, cotton raw, oil meals, sugar, castor oil and tea.

34
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Key Destinations: Indian agricultural/horticultural and processed foods are exported to more than 100
countries/regions.

o For the agriculture and allied products exports, USA was the largest export destination during 2020-21 and China
was the second largest. Other major destinations were Bangladesh, UAE, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

• Export as percentage of GDP: The agricultural exports as a percentage of India’s agricultural GDP has increased from
9.4 % in 2017-18 to 9.9 % in 2018-19.

Constraints in Agricultural exports
• Poor backward integration: The
backward integration in India
especially for perishables is
inefficient and unorganized,
resulting
in
quality
and
longevity issues.

• High cost due to poor logistics:
Poor logistics are estimated to
add 6-8% to the Free On Board
(FOB) cost when compared to
developed
countries
like
Germany, Singapore, and Hong
Kong.

o FOB costs include transportation of the goods to the port of shipment, loading the goods onto the shipping
vessel, freight transport, insurance, and unloading and transporting the goods from the arrival port to the final
destination.

• Lack of synergy: There is a lack of synergy between the state and central government as agriculture is a state subject, while “trade and commerce” are in the Union list.

• Lack of Training & Skill development:
o At farm level: Unregulated input (chemicals) usage at the farm level and Inadequate harvest and post-harvest
management affects quality and shelf life of the produce.

o At exporters’ level regarding documentation and procedures to be followed for exports and lack of awareness on
existing schemes and policies related to exports.

• Low Value addition: India has remained at the lower end of the global agri export value chain given that majority of
its exports are low value, raw or semi-processed and marketed in bulk. The share of India’s high value and value
added agri produce in its agri export basket is less than 15% compared to 25% in US and 49% in China.

• Non-tariff barriers (NTBs): Indian agriculture exports face NTBs in attractive markets such as Europe (e.g., more
stringent inspections than for other top exporting countries). NTBs and lack of strong trade agreement with target
markets are key inhibitors to dramatically increasing Indian agriculture exports.

• Quality issues: Indian agriculture commodities meet the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards of the domestic
market but encounter issues in US and EU. SPS issues lead to at-port rejections, especially for shrimps and spices
and limit India’s ability to significantly penetrate the European market.

o For instance, India has the highest number of US notifications and refusals between 2014 and 2018,
underscoring the quality challenges India will need to grapple with to grow exports.

• Other constraints:
o Uncertain government policies (e.g., export bans, policies that artificially impact the prices of commodities,
inward-looking policies that focus more on food security etc)
o Competitiveness challenges vis-à-vis countries such as Vietnam;
o Low yields, rain fed farms and high wastage leading to higher production costs and limited buffer for exports;
o Unable to export its vast horticultural produce due to lack of uniformity in quality, standardization and its
inability to curtail losses across the value chain.

o The quality regimen system needs to be strengthened end to end, from the choice of seeds to production
practices, to better planning and storage, to ensure reliable and unbroken supply to global clients.

3.5. RAILWAY SAFETY
Why in News?

After a recent train accident in West Bengal killing at least 9 people, the Railway Board Chairman asked for a thorough
probe to identify all aspects related to the accident.

Indian Railways and the importance of safety
Indian Railways is one of the largest railway systems in the world, carrying nearly 23 million passengers per day (Pre
COVID-19) and around 1.1 billion tonnes of freight; passing through nearly 8700 railway stations.

With fast, safe, and secure mobility being a key concern over such a long network, a number of committees and
subsequent initiatives are taken by Indian Railways. This includes dedicated Committees on Safety as well as other
committees making recommendations to ensure safe and secure travel such as:
• Railway Safety Review Committee (Khanna Committee) in 1998,
• High Level Safety Review Committee (Kakodkar Committee) in 2012
• Expert Group for Modernization of Indian Railways (Pitroda Committee) in 2012,
• Committee for Mobilization of Resources for Major Railway Projects and Restructuring of Railway Ministry and
Railway Board (Debroy Committee) in 2015.

operation including investigation on serious rail accidents.

• Train Collisions and Derailments: Between 2014-15 and 2019-20, the number of such accidents and number of deaths
reduced from 135 to 55 and from 292 to 5 respectively.

• Passenger Safety: As per NCRB, as compared to 27,987 accidents in 2019, 13,018 accidents happened in 2020 leading to death of nearly 12,000 railway passengers.

o Around 8,400 people or 70% lost their lives either due to falling off from the train or while crossing the railway
track.

• Road Users Safety: Around 1,014 accidents reported at various railway crossings with 1,185 deaths.

• Rescue from Human Trafficking: Over 2,000 women and children during 2017-21.

o Indian Railways launched ‘Operation AAHT’, a nationwide operation to curb human trafficking (with traffickers
often using Indian Railways network).

Gaps in creating a Safe and Secure Railway Network
Statistically, the Indian Railways performance on fast, safe and secure mobility count has been steadily improving. But a
large number of safety concerns still remain. As the density of traffic is increasing with trains becoming heavier and faster,
Indian Railway Network faces number of gaps in safe and secure mobility such as:
• Structural gaps: Huge backlog of renewal and replacement of over aged assets for safe running of railways. According
to the Standing Committee on Railways (in 2019), Indian Railways network has 1,47,523 number of bridges with
serious issues over care as:
○ 92% of them are classified as minor bridges and 37,689 bridges are 100 years or older.

• Operational gaps: Lack of Fire Detection System; issues of maintenance of tracks with some of the railway network
37
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


being in extreme weather conditions.

• Financial Gaps: The severely underwhelmed railway finance due to poor internal resource generation for capital
expenditure (around 3-3.5% of total capex) limits the financial capabilities of Indian Railways.

o For instance, from 1950 to 2016, only 23% increase in rail network while passenger and freight traffic increased
by 1344% and 1642% respectively.

• Railway Staff Lapses: Out of 13,018 accidents in 2020, 12,440 accidents happened due to locomotive pilot fault. Rest
was due to errors on part of the signalman, mechanical errors, poor track repair infrastructure, bridge/tunnel collapse
etc.

• Other Gaps/Issues: All States/Union Territories are yet to form State Level Security Committee for Railways; Gaps in
providing Safe Drinking Water and other amenities to passengers; issues of water Logging in Railway Under Bridges
(RUBs); yet to accept important recommendations of various committees such as creation of railway safety authority.

Way Forward
Safety is not an attribute but an ethos that should be instilled and nurtured. Like the National Rail Plan with an objective
to create capacity ahead of demand, Indian Railways should have a safety plan for qualitative and quantitative
improvement in its network safety. This includes steps like:
• Renewal or Replacement of railway network to ensure structural safety of old tracks/bridges to meet dynamics of
heavier and faster trains of present and future.

o E.g. Re-evaluating existing classification of bridges or classifying old bridges as special/separate segments to
ensure separate inspection and maintenance.

• Augmentation of internal resources to replace obsolete technology and materials while creating new infrastructure.

o Also, ensure full utilization of various funds to meet the objectives of the creation.

• Encouraging Indigenous R&D in railway safety to make optimum use of indigenous technology for safety as well as
to reduce passenger casualties, road users casualties etc.

• Set up of Rail Safety Authority to co-ordinate with various railways departments, helping the concerned departments
to discharge their safety functions effectively.

o It can also help to address upcoming challenges like cyber-attacks/data theft to the Passenger Reservation
System.

• Set up of State Level Security Committee for Railways by all states/UTs at the earliest for increased co-ordination
and addressing misuse of railway network by criminal elements.

• Creating a code of conduct for safety to infuse the safety ethos among employees, helping to address human errors
as well through behavioral changes.

3.7. TELECOM SECTOR
Why in News?

Recently, several telecom companies opted for government offer to convert interest on deferred spectrum auction
payments and adjusted gross revenues (AGR) into equity.

Indian Telecom Sector
• It is the 2nd largest telecom sector of the world with- tele-density of 86.89% or 118.9 crore telephone connections
(September 2021) including 116.59 crore mobile connections.

41
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


○ Tele-density represents the number of telephone connections for every 100 individuals.

• In terms of Urban-Rural India, around 66 crore connections are in Urban India and 53 crore in Rural India (Rural tele-density of 59%).

• Total internet connections were 83.37 crore (June 2021) with total FDI in telecom sector rising from ₹62,386 crore (in
2002-14) to ₹1,55,353 crore during 2014-21.

Background of the issue
• Increased Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR): In 2019, Supreme Court upheld the Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) definition of adding Non-telecom revenue also in AGR; adding nearly ₹1.4 lakh crore as dues on Telecom Service
Providers (TSPs) due to the AGR definition.

o AGR is the revenue amount used to calculate the license fee and spectrum charges required to be paid by TSPs
on their revenue.

• Poor revenue streams: Lower Average Revenue Per Subscriber (ARPU) per GB wireless data (reduced from ₹268.97
in Dec. 2014 to ₹9.8 in June 2021, i.e. 96% reduction.

o Also, Over the top (OTT) services to send messages, make call etc. has reduced revenue from core services of
call and message
These financial issues alongside other issues like poor infrastructural availability etc. led to a Huge debt of over ₹3.6 lakh
crore over TSPs with some suffering much more than others.

As a way out of this, government offer to convert interest on deferred spectrum auction payments and adjusted gross
revenues (AGR) into equity, which has been accepted by some TSPs.

3.8. GENERAL NETWORK ACCESS (GNA)
Why in news?

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission issued draft Connectivity and General Network Access to the inter-State
Transmission System Regulations, 2021.

42
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS

What is General Network Access (GNA)?

• GNA means open and non-discriminatory access to the inter-State transmission system. This is in keeping with the
concept of “one nation, one grid”.

• The system does away with unnecessary contracts between power producers and the bulk consumers for delivery
of power. Any producer will have right to access to any consumer as far as the quantum contracted is met.

• Central Electricity Authority initiated the idea of GNA for:
o Proper planning of transmission system and
o Assured recovery of transmission charges from the applicant.

About the Regulations
• Regulations provide for a regulatory framework to facilitate non-discriminatory open access to licensees or
generating companies or consumers for use of inter-State transmission system (ISTS) through General Network
Access and consolidate the related regulations.

o These regulations shall come into force on such date as the Central Commission may notify.

• Entities eligible for connecting to ISTS: Eligible entities include types of Generating stations, Captive generating
plants, Standalone Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and Renewable Power Park Developer.

• Dedicated transmission lines: If the connectivity is granted to a generating station or a captive generating project,
or a standalone ESS, the dedicated transmission lines should be established, operated, and maintained by such
entities.

o In the case of a renewable power park developer, the dedicated transmission lines will be developed, owned,
and operated by the developer.

• Eligibility for GNA: The following entities shall be eligible for grant of GNA:
o State Transmission Utility on behalf of distribution licensees connected to intra-State transmission system and
other intra-State entities;
o A buying entity connected to intra-State transmission system;
o A distribution licensee or a Bulk consumer, seeking to connect to ISTS;
o Trading licensees engaged in cross border trade of electricity;
o Transmission licensee connected to ISTS for withdrawal of auxiliary power;
o Entities connected to the inter-State Transmission or for whom Connectivity granted under Connectivity
regulations has become effective, shall be eligible for applying for grant of GNA.

• Grant of GNA to entities other than STU: Entities granted connectivity to ISTS will be deemed to have been granted
GNA, equal to the quantum of connectivity from the start date of connectivity.

• Temporary GNA (T-GNA): Certain entities like Distribution licensee or Bulk consumer directly connected to ISTS,
Captive generating plant etc are eligible to apply for T-GNA to ISTS.

Benefits of GNA
• For power generators and consumers: It will ensure that a generator focusses only on producing power. Currently, a
power generator has to work out how the supply will be done due to the point-to-point access concept which is
restrictive. GNA will allow them to supply from any point.

o For Consumers will not have to be worried about where the supply will come from and what energy source it
will come from. The quantum contracted for will be transmitted to the consumer.

• Will support country's Renewable Energy programme: At present, power evacuation from renewable energy projects
is hampered by transmission constraints in renewable-rich states.

o For instance, the intra-state grid in Tamil Nadu is not capable of accommodating the peak wind generation
during the monsoon season due to low demand in the state, while the excess power cannot be transmitted to
other states due to the few interconnections with the ISTS.

• Encourage investments: GNA is expected to increase investments in the transmission segment by providing hassle-
free access to the ISTS network to renewable energy generators. An ICRA note stated that an Investment of Rs 1.8
trillion is expected from FY2021 to FY2025 in the transmission segment at the all-India level, driven by the need for
evacuation infrastructure for renewable energy projects.

• Other benefits:
o Ensure reliable transmission access to power utilities;
o Empower state power distribution and transmission companies to determine their transmission requirements
and build them;
o States will be able to optimise their power purchase costs;
o Enable the country to develop deeper power markets.

Challenges in utilizing the GNA
• Difficult to forecast demand: It may not be possible for states to accurately estimate GNA requirements because of
uncertainty in the assessment of demand, which has become quite variable.

o Also, demand forecasting is becoming increasingly complex due to the growth of decentralised generation, net
metering, and greater focus on energy efficiency.

• Emerging areas of demand: A growing trend towards the electrification of transport, agriculture and cooking is
further likely to increase demand uncertainty in the coming years.

• Variability in consumer’s choice: State discoms also find it challenging to assess the number of open access
customers that may source power from outside the state, thereby impacting accurate assessment of GNA
requirements.

• Supply Variability: Demand variability, coupled with supply variability due to the growth of renewables will present
a double whammy for system planners and may lead to overplanning of the ISTS.

Way Forward
The idea to enable One Nation, One Grid through ideas like General Network Access (GNA) have to be incorporated in the
system. But the system is financially fragile and therefore, it is essential that the cost implications of transmission planning
are studied thoroughly for various load generation scenarios.

Also, in the case of default by generating companies, care must be taken that the additional expenditure on the
transmission system is not passed on to the beneficiaries. Ensuring financial robustness in the system will ensure wider
adoption as well as long-term resilience.

3.9. CITY GAS DISTRIBUTION (CGD) NETWORK
Why in news?

Recently, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), invited electronic bids under ‘11A CGD Bidding
Round’.

More on news
• The oil regulator PNGRB invited bids for CGD
network in five geographical areas (GAs)
covering 27 districts across Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal.

• Upon finalisation of bids under these rounds,
88% of the country’s area would be authorised
for development of CGD Network to provide
access to natural gas to approximately 98% of
the country's population
About CGD Network
• CGD refers to transportation or distribution of
natural gas to enable the supply of cleaner
cooking fuel (like Piped Natural Gas or PNG) to
households, industrial and commercial units as
well as transportation fuel (like Compressed
Natural Gas or CNG) to vehicles through a
network of pipelines
• Under the PNGRB Act 2006, PNGRB grants the
authorization to the entities for developing a
CGD network (including PNG network) in a
specified GA of the country.

• CGD sector has 4 distinct segments: CNG
predominantly used as
auto-fuel, and PNG used
in domestic, commercial
and Industrial segments.

as gas generators, water heaters, and gas-
based pumps is quite low in the Indian market which has downsized the end market of the CGD value chain.

o Consumer Preference Although CGD end product is an economical and safer fuel, some consumers do not opt
for PNG connections for many attributable reasons. For example, most of the time, the person staying in a house
45

are staying in a rented accommodation, and they prefer to use bottled gas, as their jobs are transferable in
nature.

• Different types of clearances: The preference of allotment of GA depends on the monopoly of PNGRB which makes
land use by entity difficult as clearance needs to be taken from the Gram Panchayat, district authorities, state level
permissions and permission of other entities who have laid pipelines for water usage, telephones and cable network.

• Subsidy and Under Recovery on LPG: Domestic PNG competes directly with the subsidised LPG, whereas CNG
competes with diesel. Under these circumstances, CGD based on Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) will be
difficult to compete with artificially low price of LPG.

• Gas Pricing methodology: India’s natural gas pricing policy factors are dependent upon other countries’ consumption
and prices, such as the total annual volume of natural gas consumed in the USA, Mexico, Canada, European Union;
and annual average of daily prices at Henry Hub (HH), National Balancing Point (NBP), Alberta Hub and Russia.

• Safety concerns in CGD network: Another challenge is hazards in gas supply leak or rupture of pipeline resulting in
uncontrolled gas release. The gas leaks can prove hazardous if mishandled or not properly disposed-off.

Ways for ensuring successful implementation of CGD network
• Coordination amongst all stakeholders: All stakeholders – government, PNGRB, transporters and gas suppliers, CGD
entities and vendors – must work cohesively. Overcoming operational challenges and maintaining revenue efficiencies
for the suppliers would ensure uninterrupted service to the general public.

• Operation and maintenance. The safety of the system and the surrounding areas is of paramount importance in city
area. This could be ensured by frequent safety audit and inspection, behaviour based safety and training,
implementation of control & monitoring activities, risk analysis, etc.

• Leveraging technology: The scalable, data-driven solution can enable the operators to recognize the peak hour
consumption patterns based on which differential pricing during peak hours can be introduced. It could also support
the customer to reduce operational cost, increase operational safety, and provide uninterrupted, safer and affordable
PNG supply to thousands of consumers.

• Financing Research & Development (R&D): The recognition of innovative cost-effective technological solutions,
which will mitigate the costs of pipeline replacement and excavation, thus reducing overall cost and service
disruptions, are pivotal for the development of infrastructure of the industry.

3.10. SUGAR MILLS
Why in news?

Recently, the Department of Food and Public Distribution issued guidelines for restructuring under Sugar Development
Fund (SDF) Rules 1983.

More on news
• The restructuring of SDF rules is aimed to facilitate rehabilitation of financially weak but economically viable sugar
mills which have availed loans under the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) Act, 1982.

o The SDF is being utilized presently to grant loans to the sugar mills for facilitating the rehabilitation and
modernization/ Bagasse based co-generation power projects/ production of anhydrous alcohol or ethanol from
alcohol/ conversion of existing ethanol plant into Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant and development of Sugar
cane.

o The loans are provided at a concessional rate of 2% below the prevailing bank rate.

• The outstanding amount of default of SDF loans is Rs. 3068.31 crores (as on 30.11.2021).

• Key highlights of the new guidelines
o These guidelines are uniformly applicable for SDF loans availed by all types of concerns, including Co-operative
Societies, Private Limited Companies and Public Limited Companies.

o Eligibility:
✓ A sugar factory that has been incurring cash losses continuously for the last 3 financial years or
✓ Sugar factory’s net worth is negative, and the sugar factory is not closed/has not ceased to crush cane for
more than 2 sugar seasons, excluding the current sugar season is eligible to apply for re-structuring.

46
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


o Benefits
✓ Two years moratorium and then five years of repayment which is expected to provide big relief to financially
weak sugar mills which have availed SDF loans.

✓ Waiver of additional interest in full will be given to the eligible sugar factories.

✓ The rate of interest will be changed to the interest rate as per the prevailing bank rate on the date of approval
of the rehabilitation package as per SDF Rule 26 (9) (a).

General policy
• Sugarcane pricing policy
o Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP): With the amendment of the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 in 2009, the concept of
Statutory Minimum Price (SMP) of sugarcane was replaced with the FRP.

▪ The FRP is the minimum price that sugar mills have to pay sugarcane farmers to insulate them from increasing input
costs.

▪ The FRP is linked to a basic recovery rate of sugar, with a premium payable to farmers for higher recoveries of sugar
from sugarcane.

▪ It is determined on the basis of recommendations given by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP),
an expert body under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, and in consultation with state governments.

o State-Advised Prices (SAPs): Some States including Uttar Pradesh declare SAP for sugarcane considering the cost of
production and productivity levels. The SAP is generally higher than the FRP.

• Sugar pricing policy
o Minimum Selling Price (MSP): In exercise of the powers conferred by the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, Centre notified
Sugar Price (Control) Order, 2018 under which the Centre fixes the MSP after taking into account the FRP of sugarcane
and minimum conversion cost of the most efficient mills.

▪ The MSP was introduced to ensure industry may get at least the minimum cost of production of sugar, so as to enable
them to clear cane price dues of farmers.

• Public Distribution System: At present, sugar is distributed at a subsided rate of Rs 13.5 per kg to 2.5 crore families under the
Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY).

• Export policy: India’s export subsidy includes Production Assistance Scheme, Buffer Stock Scheme and Marketing and
Transportation Scheme.

Why sugar mills face liquidity crunch so frequently?

• High sugarcane production due
to combination of factors like
o Fixed prices for sugarcane:
The government has fixed
sugarcane prices to support
farmers’
revenues.

The
current price is well above
that of alternative crops.

o Controlled domestic prices
for sugar: Such prices are
well above well above
international levels of sugar
prices. It means the sugar
acreage will remain high and
immune to any international
price. This again act as an
incentive for cane growers
to keep growing sugarcane.

o High yield sugarcane varieties: The introduction of higher yielding sugarcane varieties (CO 238 developed for
use in UP) in some key producing states has taken production in those regions to fresh heights. Those gains will
most probably be maintained as farmers also have a strong incentive to yields, given their payment is dependent
on the sucrose levels.

47
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS

• Cane reservation area and bonding: Every designated mill is obligated to purchase from cane farmers within the cane
reservation area, and conversely, farmers are bound to sell to the mill. This ensures a minimum supply of cane to a
mill, while committing the mill to procure at a minimum price.

o However, this arrangement reduces the bargaining power of the farmer who is forced to sell to a mill even if
there are cane arrears (occurs when sugar mill owners delay payment to farmers for the sugarcane supplied).

o Mills, on their part, lose flexibility in augmenting cane supplies, especially when there is a shortfall in sugarcane
production in the cane reservation area. Mills are also restricted to the quality of cane that is supplied by farmers
in the area.

• Minimum distance criterion: Under the Sugarcane Control Order, the central government has prescribed a minimum
radial distance of 15 km between any two sugar mills. This regulation is expected to ensure a minimum availability of
cane for all mills.

o However, this criterion often causes distortion in the market. The virtual monopoly over a large area can give
the mills power over farmers, especially where landholdings are smaller. In addition to restricting competition,
the regulation inhibits entry and further investment by entrepreneurs.

• Trade policy for sugar: The government has set controls on both exports and imports. As a result, India’s trade in the
world trade of sugar is small. Also, it has resulted in considerable instability for the sugar cane industry and its
production.

What steps have been taken for resolving the liquidity crunch of sugar mills and how effective they are?

• National Policy on Biofuels – 2018: The policy proposed a 20% target blending rate for ethanol by 2030. Previously,
India had a 10% ethanol blending target for 2022. To raise its ethanol blending rate, the Indian government allowed
sugar mills and distilleries to expand its feedstock from C-heavy molasses to include sugarcane juice, B-heavy
molasses, and damaged food grains, and it has increased the ethanol procurement price.

o A tripartite agreement: To ensure that enough ethanol is available to achieve this, the government has helped
the sugar industry with an innovative scheme — a tripartite agreement between sugar companies, banks and Oil
Marketing Companies (OMCs). The banks fund ethanol capacity addition and the money from ethanol sales will
be used to repay the debt through a separate escrow account. However, the effectiveness of EBP scheme is being
questioned by the experts due to following reasons
✓ Sugarcane has to compete with other feedstock: Currently feedstock competition for other alcohols is very
strong as potable liquors are very important sources of tax revenues in certain cane-producing states. These
state governments are not keen to see higher percentages of molasses being diverted to fuel ethanol
production and some control the use of molasses very strictly.

✓ So, even though the sugarcane industry is generally supportive of ethanol and believes it could help resolve
the sugar surplus, the impact of ethanol may remain fairly limited.

• Export subsidy for sugar: Without subsidies Indian exports are unviable as cost of producing sugar (due to high cane
price) is way above the international sugar price. This was promptly contested by other countries in the WTO. India
has been allowed to continue with the subsidies till December 2023.

What could be done to resolve the liquidity crunch being faced by sugar mills?

• Recommendations by C. Rangarajan committee (‘Report on the Regulation of Sugar Sector in India: The Way Forward’
[submitted in 2012]).

o Phase out cane reservation area and bonding: over a period of time, states should encourage development of
market-based long-term contractual arrangements, and phase out cane reservation area and bonding. Such
individual contracts with farmers would give them the flexibility to decide which mill they want to sell their
produce to.

o Distance norm be reviewed: Removing the regulation will ensure better prices for farmers and force existing mills
to pay them the cane price on time.

o Trade policy: All existing quantitative restrictions on trade in sugar should be removed and converted into tariffs.

Appropriate tariff in the form of a moderate duty on imports and exports, not exceeding 5-10%, should be applied.

Such a trade policy will be neutral to consumers and producers. The tariff can be changed when world prices are
very high or low.

48

• Other recommendations: To find long-term solutions for the sugar industry and sugarcane farmers, a Task Force was
constituted by NITI Aayog under the chairmanship of Prof. Ramesh Chand, Member, NITI Aayog. Some of the major
recommendations of the Task Force include
o Adoption of revenue sharing formula,
o Diversification towards less water intensive crops,
o Enhanced ethanol blending,
o Revision in Minimum Selling Price of sugar,
o Redesigning of export incentives to make them WTO compliant,
o Discontinuation of buffer stocks, promotion of jaggery, etc.

▪ In order to examine the recommendations of the Task Force and CACP, and to evolve mechanism to
implement these recommendations, a Working Committee has been constituted in Department of Food
and Public Distribution (DFPD).

Offset Policy
• Offset is an important mechanism available to the domestic industry to enhance export capability.

reforms
o Offset is an obligation by an international player to boost India’s domestic defence industry if India
is buying defence equipment from it.

• This helps in acquisition of critical technologies required for high end weapons/platforms so that the
same can be leveraged for export.

• Reforms in Offset policy have been included in DAP 2020.

Others
• Specific incentives were introduced under the foreign trade policy (2015) to give a boost to exports of
defense and hi-tech items.

• Government has proposed two defence industrial corridors to promote domestic production and boost
investment in the defence sector.

Challenges
• Red tapism: Even when fielding competitive
world-class products, PSUs are hamstrung by red
tape and a poor global impression of their ability
to deliver on time and on cost, to say nothing of
through-life support.

• Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Issues: Indian

weapon platforms (Tank T-90, Su-30 fighter
aircraft etc) that are licensed productions with
IPR held by foreign Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEMs). IPR issues need to be
resolved with foreign countries/OEMs to enable
export to friendly nations.

• Pricing and Technology issue: Due to lack of
well-established processes and infrastructure,
54
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


the domestic defence industry suffers from disadvantages in terms of less competitive price and lack of high
technology.

• Low productivity: It is issue for mmost public enterprises, leading to higher per unit cost making the end product
costlier and thus, less attractive to the prospective foreign buyer.

• Identification of target countries: Indian export is mainly focused on assemblies/sub-assemblies/components of
military equipments thus making it difficult to establish a pattern about target countries which inhibits aggressive
export marketing efforts.

• The economic challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic faced by potential customers of Indian defence equipment
are also expected to pose a challenge.

• Other issues: Absence of designing and development capabilities (especially in critical technologies), Limited
participation of the private sector, Lack of industry-academia-defence linkage etc.

Way forward
• Focusing on new markets, especially developing nations, as they do not intend to focus on the development of
defence equipment and technology and most of their defence demand is met through imports.

o Enhancing role of Defence Attaches, a defence specialist cadre in MEA can be focused.

• Exemption from duties and taxes should be provided to Defence products that are exported to make them price
competitive.

• India can regularly conduct military exercises with several nations as such exercises may act as opportunities to
understand the requirements of those nations and filling those gaps with our defence exports.

• Defence Export promotion/facilitation agency should be set up with a mandate to monitor actual progress of exports
vis-à-vis planned targets.

• A ‘full package export’ is needed as potential buyer will look not only an individual weapon but a ‘full package’
consisting of a life cycle support for spares, repairs, upgrades, overhauls, simulator back up etc.

• Other steps include establishing exported oriented “Model Manufacturing plants”, adopting consortium approach for
research/design/development/manufacturing, Defence exhibition in foreign countries etc.

Major cybersecurity issues faced by South Asia
• Digital economy: Region’s digital economy is projected to rise at a massive pace. This makes South Asian nations more
prone to cyberattacks resulting in a data breach or system failure.

o As per reports, organizations in Asia are 80 percent more likely to be targeted by hackers.

• Knowledge gap: i.e., lack of instrumental, practical guidance on existing good practices, policies, security baselines,
and frameworks relating to cybersecurity
• Lacking capabilities and infrastructure: Many South Asian countries lack a strategic mind-set, policy preparedness,
and institutional oversight over cybersecurity. Region has a shortage of trained cybersecurity professionals, while staff
retention remains an issue.

• Lack of regional coordination: South Asian nations have limited sharing of threat intelligence, often because of
mistrust and a lack of transparency. Absence of a unifying framework often results in significant underinvestment.

• Rapid technological advancement: It makes threat monitoring and response more difficult, especially with more
powerful encryption, cloud computing, and the widespread growth of the Internet of Things (IoT).

• Weaponisation of social media: continually evolving cyber-attacks coupled with the use of disinformation,
concealment, and deception instigate strategic uncertainty on the magnitude and scope of potential cyberwars.

• Potential use by states: A number of States are developing ICT capabilities for military purposes. The use of ICTs in
future conflicts between States is becoming more likely.

• Threat from non-state actors: diversity of malicious non-State actors, including criminal groups and terrorists, their
differing motives may threaten regional peace and security.

Why need for regional grouping?

• Lack of global consensus: The lack of a breakthrough in the implementation of global cyber norms highlights the need
to focus efforts at the regional level.

• Incubators for new ideas: Regional organizations provide the ideal platform for consolidating efforts in capacity-
building and confidence-building.

• Better threat perception: Regional organizations also have better knowledge of the regional and national
cybersecurity landscapes of member states.

• Improved Coordination: countries in the Asia-Pacific are plagued with uneven levels of cyber maturity and a
transparency deficit, which in turn undermine trust in information-sharing as well as the ability to cooperate
effectively.

Way forward
• Cyber norm implementation should be prioritized in regional organizations through a multi-stakeholder approach
that also involves non-state actors, such as civil society organizations.

• Regional endeavors should enhance cooperation with relevant capacity-building organizations, such as the Global
Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE), to focus protection of critical infrastructure, information sharing and reduction of
conflict risks.

• Launching awareness-raising campaigns and/or developing guidelines and/or supporting educational programs for
educating mainstream users about basic cybersecurity hygiene.

• Increased responsibility of relevant actors in adopting and/or implementing dynamic management of cybersecurity
(vulnerability management, vulnerability handling processes, bug bounty programs etc.).

• Ensuring harmonization across emerging national regulatory and industry approaches; creating incentives for
security-focused behavior for both the public and private sector.

5.1. INDIA STATE OF FOREST REPORT (ISFR) 2021
Why in News?

The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change
(MoEFCC) recently released the India State of Forest Report (ISFR)
2021.

About India State of Forest Report (ISFR)
• It is an assessment of India’s forest and tree cover, published
every two years by the Forest Survey of India under the
Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.

• The first survey was published in 1987, and ISFR 2021 is the 17th report.

• With data computed through wall-to-wall mapping of India’s forest cover through remote sensing techniques, the
ISFR is used in planning and formulation of policies in forest management as well as forestry and agroforestry
sectors.

• New Chapters introduced in ISFR, 2021:
o Forest Cover assessment in Tiger reserves and Tiger corridor areas of the country.

o Above Ground Biomass Estimation using Synthetic Aperture Radar data, based on a study carried out by FSI in
collaboration with Space Application Centre (SAC), ISRO, Ahmedabad.

• Regions projected to experience least increase and sometimes even decline in rainfall: part of North-
Eastern States like Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim; North-Western parts of the country namely Ladakh, Jammu
& Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.

Concerns based on the findings of the report
• Decline in forest cover in Northeast India: The total forest cover in India’s biodiversity-rich north-eastern states has
dropped owing to natural calamities, particularly landslides and heavy rains, in the region as well as to anthropogenic
activities such as shifting agriculture, pressure of developmental activities and felling of trees.

• Survey results could be misleading: The definition of ‘forest cover’ includes plantations and monocultures plantations
– such as coffee, coconuts or mango and other orchards.

o These plantations are distinctly different from natural forests where one hectare would be home to hundreds of
species of trees, plants and fauna, whereas such plantations house only one species of tree.

• Slow increase in dense forests: The net increase in forest cover is mostly aided by gains in Open forests rather than
Dense Forests.

5.2. INDIAN ENVIRONMENT SERVICE
Why in news?

The Supreme Court asked the Centre whether it was planning a dedicated Indian Environment Service in the national
bureaucratic set-up, as recommended by a committee headed by former Cabinet secretary TSR Subramanian in 2014.

More on news
• The Court was hearing a PIL that alleged destruction of environment and forests and also executive apathy that had
resulted in measures for environment protection emerging mostly from judicial intervention.

• The court recounted the recommendations of the TSR Subramanian Committee, which had been rejected by a
parliamentary standing committee on the ground that a dedicated all-India service may lead to multiplicity of
institutions and won’t serve the desired purpose.

Background
• The high-level committee was constituted in 2014 under the chairmanship of Subramanian by the Ministry of
Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to review environmental laws in the country, and to bring
them in line with the current requirements.

• The report recorded the fact that India had a strong environmental policy and legislative framework but weak
implementation has resulted in environmental governance being criticised by conservation experts and the judiciary.

• As a step for the future, the committee said, “An Indian Environment Service may be created, as an all-India Service,
based on qualifications and other details prescribed by MoEF&CC/ DoPT/ UPSC.”
• The committee also proposed that necessary institutional framework be created for this purpose.

• Officers dealing with environment clearances and policies currently come from the all India civil services conducted
by the UPSC.

Need for the All India Environment Services
• Need of specialisation in environment governance: The public sector, including the Central and State Governments,
and various other quasi-official bodies, such as corporations, municipal boards, enforcement agencies, as well as the
industrial sectors will require reliable expertise of a high order in the management of environmental issues. Current
approval systems and monitoring mechanism function in a quasi-amateurish manner, leading to sub-optimal
management of environmental issues.

• Paucity of time with bureaucrats in existing institutions: Looking at the current administrative set-up, it can be
inferred that the government servants might not be able to spare special time for environmental causes.

• Need of proactiveness in resolving environmental issue: The country’s response to environmental issues has mostly
been reactive, with action being taken only when a problem arises. Environmental issues need an active approach
which includes harnessing of resources, ensuring sustainability, creating awareness and an early warning system to
minimise risks.

• Inadequacy of the current system: The country has a dedicated Indian Forest Service along with a number of agencies,
like the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Commission for Air Quality Management, that have come up to deal
with environmental issues. Yet time and again degradation of environment has been reported across the country. All
these points to the inadequacy of the existing system.

Way ahead
• Keeping states on board: The All India Services would contribute in vital spheres to the modernisation of
administration for rapid socio-economic development of the country and strengthen national integration. The Union
Government should persuade State Governments to agree to the constitution of the Indian Environment Service.

• Planned policy: Effective steps need to be taken to strengthen the upcoming Indian Environment Service. This can be
achieved through well-planned improvements in selection, training, deployment, development and promotion
policies and methods. Training and career development policies should be geared to this objective.

• Coordinated efforts: There should be greater coordination and periodical dialogue between the authorities in the
Union and the State Governments who are responsible for the management of All India Services. Also, All the agencies
should have the necessary powers and resources at their disposal to enforce the rules.

61
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Bridge the socio-economic inequality: To get the best talent for the Environment Services, there is a need for creating
conditions in which the larger masses of the people particularly those in the rural areas, can have an equal opportunity
to compete in the Civil Services examination with candidates belonging to the urban elite.

5.3. CHEETAH REINTRODUCTION PLAN
Why in News?

Recently, The Government of India has decided to reintroduce Cheetahs in National Parks over five years, under 'Action
Plan for Introduction of Cheetah in India’.

More in News
• 'Action Plan for Introduction of Cheetah in India’ was launched at the 19th meeting of the National Tiger
Conservation Authority (NTCA).

• Action Plan aims to establish viable cheetah metapopulation in India that allows the cheetah to perform its
functional role as a top predator and provides space for the expansion of the cheetah within its historical range
thereby contributing to its global conservation efforts.

o Cheetah is the only large carnivore that got completely wiped out from India in 1952, mainly due to over-hunting
and habitat loss.

• As per the action plan, a cohort of around 10-12 young African Cheetahs- a different subspecies (Acinonyx jubatus)
that are ideal for reintroduction will be sent from Namibia or South Africa to the grassland habitats that the Asiatic
cheetahs occupied in the past as a founder stock during the first year.

o The locally extinct cheetah-subspecies of India is found in Iran and is categorized as critically endangered. Since
it is not possible to source the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah from Iran without affecting this sub-species,
India will source cheetahs from Southern Africa, which can provide India with substantial numbers of suitable
cheetah for several years.

• Amongst the 10 surveyed sites of the central Indian states, Kuno Palpur National Park (KNP) in Madhya Pradesh has
been rated the highest. This is because of its suitable habitat and adequate prey base.

o KNP is 748 sq. km. in area, devoid of human settlements, forms part of Sheopur-Shivpuri deciduous open forest
landscape and is estimated to have a capacity to sustain 21 cheetahs.

o Kuno also offers the prospect of housing four big cats of India - tiger, lion, leopard and cheetah - and allowing
them to coexist as in the past.

• The other sites recommended for holding and conservation breeding of cheetah in India, in controlled wild conditions
are:
o Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary (1,197 sq. km, habitat 5,500 sq.km), Madhya Pradesh
o Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary - Bhainsrorgarh Wildlife Sanctuary complex (~2500 sq.km), Madhya Pradesh
o Shahgarh bulge in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan (4,220 sq.km)
o Mukundara Tiger Reserve as fenced enclosure (~80 sq.km),
Rajasthan.

Significance of Reintroduction of cheetah
• Restoration of wildlife habitat: Carnivore reintroduction/conservation
translocation is an appropriate conservation strategy to restore the
integrity of ecosystems.

o Locally cheetah as a flagship would evoke a greater focus on the
predicament of the much abused dry-open forest/savanna
ecosystems and the need to restore and manage them.

• Genetic diversity: A top-down effect of a large predator that enhances
and maintains the diversity in lower trophic levels of the ecosystems.

• Additional habitat for other species: Reintroducing cheetahs in India will
help relieve pressure on the species by creating additional habitat, which
the cheetah desperately needs to survive.

62
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS

• Economic benefits: Having cheetahs in India will boost ecotourism and enhance livelihood options and living
conditions among the local communities where the cheetah is introduced.

o Among large carnivores, conflict with human interests is lowest for cheetahs, as they are not a threat to humans
and usually do not attack large livestock,
• Support global effort to conserve cheetah: Cheetah as a species are constrained by space across their range,
protected landscapes of India offer to extend the range of the cheetah and contribute to global efforts in conserving
them.

o India would like to assist the Government of Iran and the world conservation community with conservation efforts
of the Iranian cheetah.

• Support climate change mitigation goals: It will help to enhance India’s capacity to sequester carbon through
ecosystem restoration activities in cheetah conservation areas and thereby contribute towards the global climate
change mitigation goals.

Concerns
• Coexistence of large predators: There is no science available currently to suggest that cheetahs, lions, tigers and
leopards can coexist comfortably in the same habitat. It has never occurred anywhere else before, so there is no real-
life experience to draw upon.

• Size of Indian parks: some experts have noted that the cheetah is a wide-ranging species, known to travel across
areas up to 1,000 sq km in a single year. Indian parks tend to be much smaller than those in Africa, offering less chance
for such free movement.

• Protection of grassland: Several environmentalists observe that a single species imported from a foreign country
cannot serve as the ambassador for the conservation of all grasslands occurring in India.

o India has different types of grasslands across the country: the Himalaya, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, grasslands
in the Northeast, and those in Central and Western India. They are extremely diverse and home to unique native
fauna.

• May harm the current species: Some wildlife experts are on the view that the introduction of African cheetah may
act as an alien species to the native ecosystem, which might generate negative effects on indigenous wildlife species.

• Impact other wildlife protection efforts: Attention to the new cheetahs may take away resources from wildlife
protection efforts that are already struggling to protect endangered animals.

• Human-Wildlife Conflict: Farmers often try to protect their resources, often trapping or shooting them as cheetahs
hunt more during the daytime, they are seen more often than the nocturnal predators which contribute to a higher
rate of persecution on the cheetah.

• Rehabilitation of people: Many villages will have to be shifted to make sufficient space for Cheetah's habitat.

Way forward
• Community Participation: No landscape level conservation program can be sustained without the help of local
communities. Confidence of local villagers would be won through various outreach & awareness programs.

o To spread awareness among local people and sensitize the youth, eco-clubs, nature education camps, teacher
training camps, street plays etc. would be organized regularly.

• Capacity Building: Regular in-house training of the forest officials, veterinary team, frontline staff and cheetah
tracking teams need to be organized periodically to manage the released cheetahs and other carnivores.

• Inter-sectorial collaborations: Collaboration with police and revenue department is essential to design conservation
friendly land policy and strengthening protection in and around Kuno.

• Wildlife Tourism and revenue generation: Sustainable and conservative tourism subservient to the conservation
needs of the NP and of the project need to be encouraged so that jobs and business opportunities for the local people
can be created
• Annual Review and Monitoring: After the cheetahs are released, the progress of the project need to be reviewed
regularly by both the cheetah research team and the Forest Department team for informed management.

5.4. RED SANDERS
Why in news?

Recently, Red Sanders (Red Sandalwood) has fallen back into
the ‘Endangered’ category in the International Union for
Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List.

More about news
• It was earlier classified as ‘Near Threatened’ in 2018 and
has again been classified as Endangered.

• The IUCN has assessed that over the last three
generations, the species has experienced a population
decline of 50-80 per cent.

• In 2019, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, an
agency of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, revised
its export policy to permit the export of red sander timber,
if it is obtained from cultivated land.

About Red Sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus)
• It is an Indian endemic tree species, with a restricted
geographical range in the Eastern Ghats of India.

o It is endemic to a distinct tract of forests in Andhra
Pradesh.

• It has been assessed as ‘Endangered’ as per the IUCN
criteria and scheduled in appendix II of CITES and Wildlife Protection Act.

64
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• It is also known as: Almug, Saunderwood, Red Sanders, Red Sanderswood, Red Saunders, Rakta chandana (Indian),
Lal Chandan, Ragat Chandan, Rukhto Chandan, Undum.


Significance of Red Sanders

• Timber industry: The timber of Red Sanders is highly demanded domestically and internationally, and especially in
East Asian countries like China and Japan. Red Sandalwood timber is used for making furniture, woodcraft and musical
instruments.

o The rare wavy grain variant is highly valued in Japan for its acoustic properties.

• Medicinal value: The wood at the center of the trunk (heartwood) is used as medicine. It is used for treating digestive
tract problems, fluid retention, cough and for blood purification.

o It can be used for removal of tan, blemishes, dullness and acne. In Ayurveda, it is used to treat eye disorders. It
can be used as an antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, anthelmintic agent. It is also used in cosmetics.

• Food Industry: It is used as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages. In addition, the timber is also exploited for the extraction of santalin (a red pigment used as dye and colorant in food).


65
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


Concerns
• Over-harvesting: The over-harvest of the species has left the population structure skewed, with less than 5 per cent
of the trees remaining in the wild.

o The slow growth of the species and continued harvesting leaves no time for the species to recover naturally.

• Illegal Trade: The harvest of the tree is restricted but the illegal trade like smuggling etc continues to meet the global
demand.

o This is evidenced by the large volume of timber and Red Sanders products seized by authorities at all stages of
the illegal supply Red List’s summary on Red Sanders.

• Habitat fragmentation: Anthropogenic habitat loss caused by Cattle grazing and use of the forest for local timber and
fuelwood. These trees may also be outcompeted by invasive species and diseases.

Conclusion
Red Sanders smuggling continues despite the physical deterrents and patrols in place in Andhra Pradesh, as well as
international, national and state-level laws preventing the cutting and transport of species. Conservation efforts need to
be strengthened and developed to protect the species. The cultivation of the species in plantation should be promoted
and needs monitoring to be able to better support the legal trade to relieve pressure on the wild Red Sanders.

5.5. CARBON INEQUALITY AND CLIMATE POLICY
Why in News?

A study has found that Wealthy people have disproportionately large
carbon footprints and the percentage of the world’s emissions they are
responsible for is growing.

More about News
• As per the study, in 2010, the most affluent 10% of households
emitted 34% of global CO2, while the 50% of the global population
in lower-income brackets accounted for just 15%.

o By 2015, the richest 10% were responsible for 49% of
emissions against 7% produced by the poorest half of the
world’s population.

• The resulting policy neglect of high consumers was a “missed
opportunity” to address carbon inequality and opportunities for
carbon reduction.

What is Carbon inequality?

• It refers to the phenomena of the highly unequal
distribution of carbon emissions throughout the
world.

• Carbon equality today exists between countries as
well as within countries, reflected in the findings of
the World Inequality Report (WIR), 2022:
o Carbon Inequality Between Nations: A small
number of developed countries are responsible
for substantially higher share of the CO2 emitted
globally.

✓ For instance, of the total 2,450 billion tonnes
of carbon released since 1850, North
American and European region are responsible for about 50% of these emissions. (see infographic)
o Carbon Inequality within Nations: Within countries, carbon emissions of higher income groups are significantly
higher compared to other citizens. (see infographic)
66
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• According to WIR 2022, in 1990, 63% of the global carbon inequality was due to ‘between country’ inequality but in
2019, 63% of global carbon inequality was due to ‘within country’ inequality.

• Impacts:
o Makes existing climate policies ineffective and undermines ability to meet the targets set out in the Paris
Agreement.

o Leads to social and economic inequity, since Global carbon budget is being rapidly depleted, not for the purpose
of lifting all of humanity to a decent standard of living, but to a large extent to expand the consumption of a
minority of the world's richest people.


Status of Carbon inequality in India
• Inequality within India: The
bottom 50%, middle 40% and
top 10% respectively consume
1, 2, and 9 tCO2e/capita.

• Comparison
with
other
nations:
o India is a low carbon
emitter with the average
per capita consumption of
greenhouse gas is equal to
just over 2 tCO2e lower
than the Global average of
6.6 tCO2e.

o Moreover, a person in the

of
the
population in India is responsible for, on average, 5 times fewer emissions than the average person in the bottom 50%
in the European Union and 10 times fewer than the average person in the bottom 50% in the US.

Significance of addressing Climate Inequality
• Strengthen India’s case on multilateral platforms for addressing between country carbon inequality: India has been
advocating for the just transition for the developing countries with adequate time frame and financial assistance for
climate adaptation and mitigation based on historical responsibilities.

• Standard climate measures are unjust in unequal societies: Climate policies have been disproportionately borne by
low-income consumers over the past decades, in particular via carbon and energy taxes.

o For instance, uniform carbon taxation across individuals leads to giving more polluting rights to wealthy
individuals, who are less affected by an increase in carbon prices. This leads to high emissions whose effects are
mostly borne by poorer sections.

• Designing effective climate policies: The scale of transformation required to cut greenhouse gas emissions drastically
cannot be attained if environmental and social inequalities are not integrated into the design of climate policies.

o For instance, to effectively meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, emissions of the top 10% must fall by 58%
per person which highlights the need of

67
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


Ways to address carbon inequality
• Proper tracking of individual emissions within countries with a systematic assessment of the beneficiaries and losers
of climate policies should be carried out by public authorities.

• Policy instruments targeting investments in polluting and fossil activities: Progressive wealth taxes on the ownership
of polluting activities could accelerate divestments, reduce pollution levels of the wealthiest and generate much-need
resources to scale-up investments in low-carbon infrastructures.

• Scaling up public investments in low-carbon energy production infrastructures, transport and energy efficiency in
order to ensure a fair transition and enable lower income groups to take greener decisions.

• Global carbon incentive (GCI): It was suggested by Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India to
address global carbon inequality.

o Under GCI, every country that emits more than the global average of around 5 tCO2 per person would pay
annually an amount calculated by multiplying the excess emissions per person by the population and the GCI
into a global GCI fund. Countries below the global per person average would receive a commensurate pay-out.

Conclusion
Tackling extreme inequality and targeting the excessive emissions linked to the consumption and investments of the
world’s richest people is vital to keeping the 1.5⁰C Paris goal alive.

5.6. INDIAN AGRICULTURE POST-COP26: GREEN REVOLUTION 2.0
Why in News?

Significant discussions took place at
COP26 in the direction of aligning
agriculture policies with climate action
agenda, warranting a second green
revolution along with next-generation
reform.

Green Revolution 2.0: The need for
reforms in Agriculture sector of India
• Reducing emissions: Agriculture
sector amounts to around 14% of
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of
India. Thus, reductions of emission
from the sector can play a crucial role
in fulfilling commitments by India
made in COP26 under pledge
of Panchamrit (five-fold strategy) to
fight climate change, during the
COP26.


68
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Build climate resiliency: Climate change
induces increase in temperatures,
rainfall variation and the frequency and
intensity of extreme weather events are
predicted to severely impact the
agriculture sector.

o The rise of carbon dioxide levels and
temperature in the atmosphere
have direct correlation on crop
productivity, grain quality, pest and
disease incidence, as well as on the
cropping system.

• Making food systems more sustainable:
While Green Revolution in India made
the country self-reliant in food grain
production
and
contributed
to
tremendous growth in the sector, it had
certain fallouts that threaten overall
sustainability of India’s food systems.

• Developing comprehensive policy to
deal with persistent issues: like low
crop productivity, post-harvest loss,
poor water use efficiency, food inflation
and volatility in prices, fragmented
landholdings,
lower
farm
mechanisation, scarce public and private
investment in agriculture etc.

• Addressing ‘food–energy–water’ (FEW) nexus:
It is important to incorporate FEW in future
agriculture policies for effective trade-offs and
synergies between energy, water and food,
considering
cross-sectoral
policies,
environmental and social impacts.

o The FEW nexus depicts the significant
interconnection between the three
essential
resources.

For
instance,
Agricultural accounts for majority of India’s
groundwater withdrawals through use of
electric motors. Thus, water use efficiency
in agriculture will not only help
groundwater resources to rejuvenate but
also reduce energy demand from the
sector.

Progressive steps taken in India
• Climate resiliency
o National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), one of the 8 missions under National Action Plan on Climate Change,
aims at making agriculture more productive, sustainable, remunerative and climate resilient.

o National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) programme is in place to enhance the resilience of Indian
agriculture, covering crops, livestock and fisheries to climatic variability and climate change.

o National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) supports adaptation action, in, inter alia, agriculture, water,
forestry, livestock and ecosystems.

• Resource use efficiency:
o Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana (PMKSY) aims to Introduce sustainable water conservation practices, among
others.

o Soil Health Cards scheme: to improve Soil Health by providing nutrients information to the farmers.

o Micro Irrigation Fund corpus of Rs. 5000 crore created with National Bank of Agricultural and Rural Development
(NABARD).

• Greener approaches:
o Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana aims at promotion of commercial organic production through certified organic farming.

o Active promotion of Zero Budget Natural Farming, a method of chemical-free agriculture drawing from traditional Indian
practices.

o Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar
Pradesh and NCT of Delhi.

o Bharatiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati Programme (BPKP) promotes on-farm biomass recycling with major stress on biomass
mulching, use of on-farm cow dung-urine formulations, periodic soil aeration and exclusion of all synthetic chemical inputs.

• Other Steps-
o Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme of the government aims to
improve irrigation access and raise farmers’ income through solar-powered irrigation.

o Promotion of millet production through hike in Minimum support price (MSP).

o Department of Agricultural Research & Education (DARE) developed 35 special trait varieties including biofortified and
stress tolerant varieties of field and horticulture crops during 2021-22.

5.7. ZERO-BUDGET NATURAL FARMING (ZBNF)
Why in news?

Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) committee
highlighted that ZBNF would result in tremendous reduction
in production of agricultural crops thus compromising
India’s food security.

More on news
• ICAR had set up a committee, under V Praveen Rao in
2019 to empirically validate the results of ZBNF.

• The committee is likely to submit its report soon.

• Reportedly,
o the committee has stressed for need to conduct long-
term field trials on ZBNF.

o the committee suggested that future research on
ZBNF should be carried out only in rainfed regions
instead of irrigated zones which produce the biggest
chunk of agricultural crops production in the country.

o the committee has also recommended adoption of an
integrated production system through usage of
farm practices such as
o promoting conservation agriculture through
usage of farmyard manure, inter-cropping, crop
diversification
and
integrated
nutrient
management for improving soil health.

About ZBNF
• It is a method of chemical-free agriculture drawing
from traditional Indian practices.

o The word ‘budget’ refers to credit and expenses,
thus the phrase 'Zero Budget' means without
using any credit, and without spending any
money on purchased inputs. 'Natural farming'

• ZBNF was mentioned in two budget speeches of the Central government in 2019-20 and 2020-21.

71
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


Significance of ZBNF
• Eco-friendly: ZBNF processes require
50%–60% less water and less electricity
(than non-ZBNF) for all the selected
crops. ZBNF reduces methane emissions
significantly through multiple aeration. It
also has the potential to avoid residue
burning by practising mulching.

• Improving soil health: The ZBNF method
also promotes soil aeration, minimal
watering, intercropping, bunds and
topsoil
mulching
and
discourages
intensive irrigation and deep ploughing.

All these factors results in improving soil
health.

• Doubling farmers’ income: According to
National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
data, almost 70% of agricultural
households spend more than they earn
and more than half of all farmers are in
debt.

o In order to achieve the Central
government’s promise to double
farmers income by 2022, one aspect
being considered is natural farming
methods such as the ZBNF which reduce farmers’ dependence on loans to purchase inputs they cannot afford.

Meanwhile, inter-cropping allows for increased returns.

5.8. BIODIVERCITIES BY 2030
Why in News?

The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently
published a report titled ‘BiodiverCities by 2030:
Transforming cities’ relationship with nature’
developed as an output of the BiodiverCities by 2030
initiative.

6. SOCIAL ISSUES
6.1. GLOBALIZATION: SLOWDOWN OR MUTATING?

Why in News?

With global interconnectedness emerging as an essential mechanism behind the spread of changing coronavirus variants,
the world is going through debate on the future of globalization.

Globalization and its Growth
Globalization is defined as ‘a process associated with increasing openness, growing economic interdependence and
deepening economic integration in the world of economy’.

Such economic integration and interdependence are not new. But in the last 3 decades, the global economic conditions
have encouraged the spread of Globalization-
• Greater mobility of goods and people due to faster and safer transportation with sharp decline in costs.

• Global flow of Information through advancements in communication and technology due to the Internet and IT
Revolution.

• Rule-based global trade system with help from World Trade Organization (WTO) towards reduction in tariff and non-
tariff barriers to establish open markets.

predictability and standardization, and control.

• Easy flow of capital between different economies.

Slowdown of Globalization: Dissatisfaction and Reducing Significance
The rapid growth in globalization has given rise to multiple domestic and international problems as well.

Prevalence of these reasons was further aggravated with rising concerns over use of global infrastructure E.g., ‘Belt and
Road’ initiative and threat to sovereignty arising from deeper global economic integration.

COVID-19 and Globalization: Phase of Slow Down or Mutation
In almost two years of its
existence, Covid-19 pandemic
had a significant influence on the
economic, social, and political
dimensions of globalization

78
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Political Globalization: Increased blame game among nations (USA-China), expansionism (e.g. China) leading to global
tensions as well as cooperation (e.g. AUKUS, QUAD). Some countries have also worked to fight the pandemic jointly
(e.g., Vaccine Maitri by India).

The outbreak of COVID-19 and its repercussions
have acted like an inflection point for the
already fragile ecosystem of globalization. These
trends point towards a different form of
globalization.

Future of Globalization: Globalization 4.0
• Structural shifts in the Global Value Chain
(GVC):
o Goods-producing value chains have
grown less trade-intensive which is
indicated by the falling value of trade
intensity (that is, the ratio of gross
exports to gross output).

o Trade in services has grown faster than
trade in goods with the former growing
almost 60% faster.

o Share of trade based on labor-cost
arbitrage has been declining.

o GVCs are growing more knowledge
intensive and are becoming more regional and less global.

• Geography of global demand is continuously shifting towards developing countries with rising domestic
consumption in countries such as India and China.

• Technological developments like growth of digital platforms, 5G technology, 3D Printing, artificial intelligence could
boost trade and simultaneously change the nature of trade.

• Fundamental shift in the definition and behavior of a customer in a highly digitized world.

Globalization will need to be built on exchanges and learning on a more equal footing, stressing more on diversity, rather
than in contrast to erstwhile single-minded homogenization of societies.

6.2. HATE CRIME
Why in News?

Recently, perpetrators of mobile apps, which featured a humiliating mock auction of more than a hundred Muslim women
active in public life, were arrested.

About Hate Crimes
• Hate crimes, or bias-motivated crimes, are defined as offenses motivated by hatred against a victim based on his or
her race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or national origin.

• Hate crimes are the most extreme expression of prejudice. Compared to other crimes, hate crimes have a more
destructive impact on victims and communities because they target core aspects of our identity as human beings.

• Hate incidents may result in severe harms, and/or escalate over protracted periods of time into more serious forms
of emotional, sexual and/or physical abuse.

• Perpetrators of hate crimes are not always motivated by a single type of prejudice or hatred but can be influenced
by a combination of different prejudices.

Causes of hate crime
• Prejudices: Perpetrator may have intense feelings of prejudice against an entire identity group leading to him or her
feeling disgust and even hatred towards members of that group.

79
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Lack of Understanding about
differences among people, and
their traditions, contributes to
fear and intolerance. Left
unaddressed, these sentiments
can lead to acts of intimidation
and hate-motivated violence.

• Perception of threats: Realistic
threats consist of tangible
conflicts of interest – such as
perceived competition over
jobs,
housing
and
other
resources. Immigrants and
disabled people are two groups
often targeted.

o Other symbolic threats
relate to people’s social
identities, such as different
way of life, including
culturally important values
and norms.

• During armed conflict: Political
tensions and armed conflicts
can pit communities, defined
by ethnicity, origin, language or
religion, against one another
• Administrative Failure: Given
the state of the police and judiciary in the country, there is a
wide-ranging perception that ‘culprits’ go unpunished and that
there is a chance that the accused in hate crimes will go scot-
free.

• Political Patronage: In the competitive electoral politics, the
culture of political mobilization based on social faultlines for
polarization of electorate into votebanks and use of violence for
garnering support and intimidating opponents, has gained
strength.

Impact of hate crimes
• Fear Psychosis: emotional and psychological trauma caused by
hate crime is heightened compared with other types of crime
and affects not just the person experiencing it, but the
community to which they belong.

• Attacks on core of victim’s identity: Hate crimes increase
feelings of vulnerability, anxiety, anger, and sometimes shame;
these emotional reactions motivate specific behavioural
responses:
o Anger leads to pro-active behaviours and less avoidance
o Anxiety leads to avoidance and security concerns
o Shame is linked to avoidance, pro-active behaviours, security concerns, and uniquely to retaliation
• Hate crimes tend to increase in numbers: If law/community does not effectively punish and repudiate hate crimes,
perpetrators are encouraged to continue their activities, and the number of hate crimes will increase.

• Prohibit those holding constitutional and public offices including as ministers, Members of Parliament or state

• Sensitise subordinate judiciary dealing with such hate crimes by holding seminars and workshops at regular intervals
involving social activists, psychologists, other activists, lawyers from all communities.

• Promoting school projects to educate students about hate crimes and counter possible bias-motivated bullying.

There is a need for systematically educating all students about prejudice and intolerance.

• Civil society plays an indispensable role in raising awareness about hate crime. The relevant authorities can work
with civil society to improve the identification, registration and monitoring of hate crimes/incident.

6.3. MARITAL RAPE AND CONJUGAL RIGHTS
Why in News?

Recently, the Centre sought reasonable time from Delhi High Court to share government opinion on Marital Rape after
consultation with all stakeholders.

About Marital Rape and Legal position in India
• Rape represents any nonconsensual sexual intercourse or consent gained by using any kind of fear, fraud or under
situation of unsoundness of mind, intoxication etc.

• Such sexual intercourse or Rape between non-spouses is illegal but Marital Rape, i.e., the act of having nonconsensual
sexual intercourse with one’s own wife, is kept outside the definition of rape in many countries.

• In India also, under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), nonconsensual sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a
man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is kept as exception outside the definition of
rape.

○ Section 376-A criminalizes the rape of judicially separated wife.

• Also, the either spouse carries the right for ‘Restitution of Conjugal Rights’ under Divorce Act, 1869 (related to the
divorce of persons belonging to the Christian religion), Special Marriage Act (SMA) of 1954 and Hindu Marriage Act
(HMA) of 1955 etc.

• Although Section 3 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence, 2005 contradicts the exception provided
by section 375 and considers any physical, sexual, verbal, and emotional abuse as Domestic Violence.

81
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS

Conjugal Rights (Right to Stay Together)

Conjugal means relating to marriage. So, conjugal rights represent the ‘rights relating to marriage or created by marriage’.

• It traces its roots in medieval ecclesiastical law of England when women lacked individual identity and were treated as
husband’s personal possession.

• Conjugal rights are part of Indian laws dealing with marriage, divorce etc., allowing a spouse to move to court for restitution
of conjugal rights in case wife or husband withdraws from society without reasonable excuse.

• Though a gender-neutral law with utility in saving marriage, the restitution provisions were recently challenged in Supreme
Court (Ojaswa Pathak versus Union of India) as:
o It goes against the individual dignity, bodily autonomy and privacy (in Joseph Shine judgement, 2018- SC held that State can’t exercise authority in a person’s private affairs).

• Decree of restitution of conjugal rights goes against individual right to autonomy and self-determination and a coercive act
from state.

• It goes against individuality and empowers courts to attach the property if the restitution order isn’t complied.

Negative impact of exception to Marital Rape in Section 375 of IPC
• On Individual: It forces the wife to live in an environment that is emotionally unsupportive, physically violent, and
strongly patriarchal, limiting her individuality and dignity.

o E.g., As per National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-2016), 7% of ever-married women experienced spousal sexual
violence with 83% reporting it from current husband.

• On Relationship: It indirectly makes husband the master of wife, which affects the behavior, choices and thinking of
wife as well as the sanctity of marriage.

o Justice Verma Committee set up in the aftermath of Nirbhaya Case recommended for removal of this exception.

It pointed out that the acceptance for marital rape stems from the outdated notion of wives as property and goes
against the institution of marriage in modern times as a partnership of equals.

• On Children: It also forces the children to live in an atmosphere of sexual abuse and violence, carrying risks of serious
developmental issues.

• On Society: It increases the societal inequalities based on gender and weakens community sanctions against
perpetrators. Thus, creating an environment of tolerance towards sexual assault from husband.

• On Institutions: It limits the ability of institutions such as the police and judicial system to provide support to vulnerable women.

The negative impact created by this exception points towards criminalization of marital rape. But the implementation of
the same has some issues.

Concerns over criminalization of Marital Rape
Marriage is considered as a sacred bond in India by a large section of society. It is an important institution for the survival
of the family with living together at its foundation. For long, State’s approach was largely of non-intervention in family
life due to their concerns such as:
• Threat to the Institution of marriage as it may amount to excessive interference with the marital relationship (172nd
Report of the Law Commission on Review of Rape Laws in 2000).

• Risk of its misuse as a tool to harass husband, if criminalized.

• Subject the entire Family System to great stress (Standing Committee on Home Affairs, 2013).

• High Subjectivity, as it is difficult to prove in a court of law whether the sex was consensual or not.

Way Forward
The civility of a civilization earns warmth and respect when it supports the individuality of a woman. In the last few years,
several laws have gone through progression to ensure real spirit of equality and make individual dignity a sacred realm
of Indian Society.

Marital Rape is also one such exception which should go as- Consent in marriage can’t be consent forever and at the cost
of dignity of one individual. Therefore, all stakeholders must come together, especially state to end all forms by sexual
assault or violence through:
82
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Proper definition of marital rape under criminal laws in order to remove provisions
which lead to inequality and allow wife to take up the issue as a criminal offense.

E.g.

o In Independent Thought vs Union of India (2017), Supreme Court criminalized
the marital rape with wife between 15-18 years of age.

o Similarly, the Kerala High Court allowed Marital Rape as a valid ground for
Divorce.

• Progressive interpretation of the Civil and Criminal laws of the Indian Constitution
and Fundamental Rights for comprehensive amendments to criminal laws related
to rape.

• Study laws of other country who have abolished the immunities of marital rape made it a criminal offence i.e. goes
against right to bodily self-determination.

• Create awareness in society on violence in order to change attitude towards women and modify the old socio-cultural
practices which allow woman to be treated as property and lead to violence in private spaces.

6.4. INDIA’S PERFORMANCE IN SPORTS
Why in News?

Recently, the PM called youth to consider careers in sports and others to encourage the youth in the country to foster a
sports culture in the country.

How has India’s performance been in Sports?

Despite sports being an integral component of all-round human personality development and entertainment, India has
very little to show as achievement in international sports. This can be evidently seen through the following-
• Limited international participation: India has had very few big names in international sports except in some sports
like cricket.

• Poor performance in Olympics: At the recent Tokyo Summer Olympics and Paralympics, India had its best
performance till date with 7 and 19 medals respectively.

o Overall, India has won only 35 medals at the summer Olympics since 1900 edition.

o In the Winter Olympic Games India is yet to win a
medal. Similarly, it qualified only once for FIFA World
Cup in 1950.

This poor performance from Indian athletes at international
competitions can be attributed to a number of reasons (see
image).

What are the steps that have been taken to address the poor
performance?

With sports being an important means to promote bonding
among people and gain national pride and prestige,
government has taken number of initiatives to promote sports
in India such as:
• Policy Initiatives: National Sports Policy for broad basing
of sports and achieving excellence in sports at national and
international level.

• Administrative Initiatives: Set up of Sports Authority of
India (SAI) as an autonomous organization to provide
training facilities to athletes and to identify and develop young talent.

o E.g., Special Area Games Scheme to identify sporting talent at young age from the tribal, backward, and hilly
areas.

83
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Support and Promotion Schemes: The
Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has
started number of flagship Central
Sector Schemes such as:
o Target Olympic Podium Scheme
(TOPS) to provide assistance to a
selected set of athletes.

o Khelo India - National Programme
for Development of Sports to infuse
sporting
culture
and
achieve
sporting excellence in the country
through various initiatives (see
image).

• Digital Initiatives: Development of
National Sports Repository System
(NSRS) as a digital platform for online
registration of athletes, coaches, and
sports training centers.

• Sports Education Development: Setting
up of institutions to provide higher
education in branches of knowledge related to Physical Education and Sports Science. E.g., Lakshmibai National
Institute of Physical Education.

• Incentives to Sportspersons: National Sports Award to recognize outstanding performances. E.g., Major Dhyan Chand
Khel Ratna Award, Arjuna Award, Dronacharya Award etc.

What are the foundational issues and limitations of existing Initiatives?

• Poor Health: Due to malnutrition, i.e., deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or
nutrients, the interest and performance in sports suffer.

• Low participation at the base: Due to lack of resources, a large section of the Indian population doesn’t take sports
seriously or lack participation in sports.

• Lack of Sports Culture: Except few states (e.g., Haryana), sports are seen as an extracurricular activity or passion.

Therefore, children are encouraged to devote majority of their time on studies and treat sports as a leisure activity,
not to be taken very seriously.

• No Assured Career Progression: In India, except athletes who excel at national and international level, others leave
sports early due to absence of career opportunities at state or local level.

• Governance Issues: In day-to-day functioning of sports federations, training centers etc. a number of sports
federations/bodies face issues of political interference, maladministration etc. such as corruption, nepotism or
discrimination in sports selection. E.g., Commonwealth Games (CWG) Scam.

• Lack of Recognition: Except few sports like Cricket, most sports and players lack recognition and encouragement from
government, broadcasters, media and most importantly from people around them.

• Lack of Technology and Support System: In comparison to other nations, Indian athlete’s face issues of outdated
technology, lack of coaching, limited medical facilities etc.

Way Forward
To create international athletes and foster a sports culture in the country, India will have to take steps toward:
• Creation of world-class sports infrastructure to provide necessary training facilities.

○ Big sports infrastructure will also help in creation of new job opportunities for the youth and encourage them to
pursue sports as a career.

• Building of Institutions, i.e., School, colleges, and universities to develop dedicated staff, infrastructure, competitions
to foster the culture of sports.

• Governance reforms in sports federations/bodies to reduce political interference and ensure transparency in their
84
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


functioning ensuring fair selection.

• Use of scientific knowledge (e.g., Kinanthropometry) in the process of early identification of talent and training them
for sports.

o Kinanthropometry is defined as the study of human size, shape, proportion, composition, maturation, and gross
function, in order to understand growth, exercise, performance, and nutrition.

• Engaging the private sector in sports promotion. E.g., Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) with corporate participation has
helped Kabaddi as a sport and its players to gain recognition.

• Develop an assured Career Progression for athletes with clearly identified opportunities. This can be done by
supporting a complete ecosystem which includes coaches, infrastructure, trainers and leagues at every level.

• Promotion of Physical Fitness among people through sports by encouraging existing players to interact with people.

E.g., the recent call from PM to Olympians for visit to 75 schools by the 2023 Independence Day.

• Develop India as a manufacturing hub for sports to ensure availability of equipment. It will also help in promotion of
R&D to aid in performance of athletes.

6.5. ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION
Why in News?

Recently, the world’s first pig-to-human transplant took place in USA.

More in News
• Recently, the world’s first pig-to-human transplant took place in USA.

• A team at the University of Maryland Medicine transplanted a heart
from a pig with 10 modifications into a terminally ill man.

o The patient had been deemed ineligible for a human
transplant, hence went for pig heart transplant.

• The pig used in the transplant had been genetically modified to
knock out several genes that would have otherwise led to the organ
being rejected.

o These pigs are bred to lack genes that can cause rejection. They
are reared until they reach an age where their organs are big
enough to be harvested for transplantation.

o Also, in October 2021, Doctors in New York announced had
successfully transplanted a pig's kidney into a person.

• The possibility of using animal organs for Xenotransplantation is to meet
the demand for organs and pig heart valves are already widely used in
humans, and pig skin is grafted on human burn victims.

o Xenotransplantation has seen significant advances in recent years with
the advent of CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing, which made it easier to
create pig organs that are less likely to be attacked by human immune
systems.

About Organ transplant
• Organ donation and transplantation is removing an organ from one person
(the donor) and surgically placing it in another (the recipient) whose organ
has failed.

o Organs must be removed as soon as possible after the determination
of brain death, while circulation is being maintained artificially. Tissues
may be removed within 12 to 24 hours.

▪ Brain death results from a severe, irreversible injury to the brain. All areas of brain are damaged and no longer
function due to which a person cannot sustain his/her own life, but vital body functions may be maintained
by an artificial support system.

o People who have a cardiac death cannot be organ donors however they can donate tissues after death.

85
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


▪ Cardiac death results when the heart and breathing cease to function.

• Benefits: The benefits of an organ transplant depend on the organ a person receives. Some benefits may include:
o Avoiding medical procedures such as dialysis
o Living a longer life
o Living a healthier or less painful life
o Gaining an improved quality of life, such as when a cornea
transplant restores a person’s sight
o Correcting congenital disabilities that endanger a
person’s life
o Spending less time in the hospital, needing fewer
surgeries, or taking fewer medications
• Risks: Some risks associated with organ transplant surgery
Trusted Source include:
o Complications related to the use of anesthesia, including
death
o Bleeding or other complications during the procedure
o Postsurgical complications, such as infection
o A higher risk of infections and other illnesses due to anti-
rejection or other transplant-related drugs
o Organ rejection
o Organ failure

Superstitions such as being born with a

that tampering with the body will not free

superstitions.

• Organizational Support: The lack of an
adequate number of transplant centers
with staff as well as transplant coordinators
who are adequately educated and well
versed with the procedures required to
conduct an organ donation program is
acting as a significant roadblock to the
deceased organ donation program.

• Organ Transport: Sometimes, organs are
transported from the donor hospital to the
transplant center where the recipient is located. There have been many instances where valuable organs have been
wasted due to delay in the transportation process.

• Illegal organ trade and trafficking: The increasing demand for organs pushed profiteers to exploit poverty-stricken
parts of India to offer cash for organs.

o Organ trafficking, according to World Health Organization (WHO), is a commercial transplantation, where there
is profit, or transplantations occur outside of national medical systems.

misappropriated. Hence, it is very important to have a
transparent system of organ allocation.


• Organ Transport: The government can help by providing financial help by collaborating with air carriers to help in
mobilizing the donated organ to different parts of the country and thereby preventing organ wastage. Green corridor
concept should be taught in the school curriculum to make the next generation aware of the process.

Challenges in Animal to Human transplantation
• Adequate study: Experts suggest that it is important to study the transplants in humans. Pig hearts are anatomically similar
to human hearts but not identical. It's not ideal, compared to swapping in a human donor heart.

• Commercialisation: Several companies are engineering pigs for solid organ transplants with different genetic modifications,
although none yet has medical-grade facilities. There are concerns regarding the unknown long-term effects of genetic
modification on the pig's health.

o E-Genesis in Cambridge is making pigs that cannot pass on retroviruses that are present in all pig genomes.

o NZeno in Auckland, is breeding miniature pigs whose kidneys remain human-sized.

• Animal Rights: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has condemned pig heart transplant as ‘unethical,
dangerous, and a tremendous waste of resources. They contest that animal have a right to live their lives, without being
genetically manipulated and bear trauma only to be killed for their organs harvested.

• Gaganyaan would be smaller in size than the current manned missions of Russian Soyuz, Chinese Shenzhou and
NASA's planned Orion spacecraft.

Challenges
• Hostile environment: The ‘Gaganyaan’ has to
create an atmosphere like Earth inside a small
volume and ensure that adequate supply of
oxygen,
removal
of
carbon-dioxide
and
comfortable temperature and humidity levels are
maintained throughout the mission.

• Gravity field: Transitioning from one gravity field
to another has impact on the physical bodies. It
affects hand- eye and head-eye coordination.

NASA has learned that without gravity working on
the human body, bones lose minerals.

• Isolation: Due to isolation, one may encounter
depression,
fatigue,
sleep
disorder
and
psychiatric disorders.

• Radiation: In space stations, astronauts receive over ten times the radiation than what people are subjected to on
Earth. Radiation exposure may increase the risk of cancer. It can damage the central nervous system and cause
nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue.

• Rockets: These are extreme machines. Travelling in a rocket is like sitting on an exploding bomb which will push your
speed from 0 kmph to 29,000 kmph in less than 30 minutes. Many safety features have to be built into rocket systems
to ensure the probability of loss of life is minimized. However, testing of all these systems in an actual operating
environment is difficult.

• Physiologic and metabolic requirements: An astronaut requires approximately 5 kgs of oxygen, food and water per
day to perform the standard activities. These levels can vary with the activity of a specific mission. Water use may
also be double. A composite management system has to be designed to minimize and store the waste efficiently.

92
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS

• Launch escape system: Space flight requires much higher velocities than air transportation which in turn requires
high energy density propellants. This requires high amount of energy through the Earth’s atmosphere. Anything may
go wrong during the prelaunch, launch and post launch phase including the expolsion of rocket into a fireball. Launch
escape systems safety features have to be built to minimize the losses.

• Re-entry and Recovery: The mastering of the highly complicated reentry and recovery technology is needed. When a
spacecraft reenters Earth’s atmosphere, it would have to withstand high temperatures of thousands of degrees due
to friction with air. The spacecraft’s re-entry into the atmosphere has to be very precise, even the slightest deviation
could lead into a disaster.

Conclusion
The Gaganyaan mission could propel India to the centre of human space exploration. The manned missions will push
India further in exploration beyond Earth's orbit as countries are eager to control the next space race, which has the
potential to trigger major changes in the global order.

AMR.

o Antibiotic Consumption in Food Animals - Antibiotics that are critical to human health are commonly used for
growth promotion in poultry. For e.g. Colistin is used as a growth supplement in poultry and animals.

o Pharmaceutical Industry Pollution - The wastewater effluents from antibiotic manufacturing units contain a
substantial amount of antibiotics, leading to the contamination of rivers and lakes.

o Infection Control Practices in Healthcare Settings - poor infection control in hospitals promotes the development
of AMR.

o Social factors - including self-medication, access to antibiotics without prescription and lack of knowledge about
when to use antibiotics.

o Cultural Activities- Mass bathing in rivers as part of religious mass gathering occasions.

Impacts of AMR
• Inability to treat common infections: New resistance mechanisms make it difficult to treat infectious diseases
resulting in prolonged illness, disability and an increase in death rate.

• Increased threat to medical procedures: Medical procedures such as organ transplantation, cancer chemotherapy,
diabetes management and major surgery (for example, caesarean sections or hip replacements) become very risky.

• Increased cost of healthcare: Owing to lengthier stays in hospitals, additional tests and use of more expensive drugs.

This also increases the cost of AMR to national economies.

• Adverse impact on animal health: As it undermines the effectiveness of veterinary medicines.

• Impact on agriculture and livelihood: Beyond more direct implications for food production and food safety, it is
estimated that in ten years’ time, 24 million more people may be forced into extreme poverty because of AMR.

look beyond the biomedical or health sectors for solutions.

• One Health Approach - To restrain AMR, there is need for a One Health Approach through coherent, integrated, multi
sectoral cooperation and actions, including policy makers, farmers, veterinarians & food producers and Health

About electrical vehicle
• An electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on an electric
motor, instead of an internal-combustion engine that
generates power by burning a mix of fuel and gases.

• While some EVs used lead acid or nickel metal hydride
batteries, the standard for modern battery electric vehicles
is now considered to be lithium-ion batteries as they have
a greater longevity and are excellent at retaining energy,
with a self-discharge rate of just 5% per month.

Need/Opportunities for Electric Vehicles (EVs) push
• To minimise GHG emissions: Transport sector in India is
the second largest source of CO2 emissions worldwide.

Within transportation, road transport has been the highest
contributor to the GHG emission in the country.

• To reduce crude oil import bill: Currently, Indian
transportation sector accounts for one-third of the total
crude oil consumed in the country, where 80% is being
consumed by road transportation alone.

• To meet Paris agreement goals: To achieve the GHG
emission target committed under Intended Nationally
Determined Contributions (INDCs), it is inevitable that
India transits to greener mobility technologies in
transport.

• Rising motorization rates: With one of the lowest
motorization rates in the world (22 cars per 1,000
people), India is among the fastest growing countries in
transportation sector.

o India has also set the national target of achieving 30% EV sales penetration by 2030.

• Economic opportunities: Many start-ups have entered into manufacturing of EVs in past 5-7 years and conventional
vehicle manufacturers, both domestic and global, are also launching EVs in Indian marketplace.

Steps taken by India to promote Electric Vehicles
• India launched E-Amrit portal (at COP26 Summit in Glasgow) as a one-stop destination for all information on electric
vehicles.

• National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 seeks to enhance national energy security, mitigate adverse
environmental impacts from road transport vehicles and boost domestic manufacturing capabilities for Electric
Vehicles.

• FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles) scheme was first launched in 2015
under NEMMP 2020 to enhance hybrid and electric technologies in India
• Phase-II of FAME scheme to stimulate the market of EVs in the country, de-licensed the charging infrastructure
business and specified guidelines & standards for charging infrastructure for electric vehicle.

• Several states (including Delhi, UP, MP, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh etc) have notified their EV policies aimed at
promoting manufacturing and increasing demand of electric vehicles in their respective states.

• Recently, Ministry of Power released the
guidelines on EV charging infrastructure
which addresses the need for adequate
availability of charging stations.

• In 2019, Ministry of Housing and Urban
Affairs notified Amendments in Model
Building Bye-Laws - 2016 for EV charging

• Phased Manufacturing Program, AatmaNirbhar Bharat, and incentives announced by several states in their EV policy
should be leveraged to strengthen the battery manufacturing in medium to long run.

• Discoms need to actively participate in planning for EV charging infrastructure because of their inherited capability
of existing infrastructure, existing consumer base and superior technical skills.

• Need policy guidance on standardization of battery for EVs, and strategies to address huge upfront capital
requirement for a massive uptake of battery swapping business model.

• Financial Institutions should be encouraged to extend their lending facility to electric mobility sector.

• Creation of non-financial incentives such as priority lanes, reserved parking for EV only vehicle, EV Purchase subsidy
over and above FAME II subsidy etc. for better response from consumers.

• Online portal and single window clearance system for availing clearances and subsidies/rebate in transparent
manner.

How does IoT work?

• An IoT ecosystem
consists of web-
enabled
smart
devices
use
embedded systems,
such as processors,
sensors
and
communication
hardware,
to
collect, send and act
on data they acquire
from
their
environments.

• These share the
sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT
gateway or other edge device where data is sent
to the cloud to be analyzed locally.

• Sometimes, these devices communicate with
other related devices and act on the information
they get from one another.

• The devices do most of the work without human
intervention, although people can interact with
the devices for instance, to set them up, give
them instructions or access the data.

Significance of IoT
• Communication:
IoT
encourages
the
communication between devices, also known as
M2M communication. The physical devices are
able to stay connected and hence the
transparency
is
available
with
lesser
inefficiencies and greater quality.

• Automation and Control: Due to physical objects getting connected and controlled digitally there is a large amount
of automation and control in the workings. Without human intervention, the machines are able to communicate with
each other leading to faster and timely output.

• Better monitoring of devices: M2M communication helps to maintain transparency in the processes. It leads to
uniformity in the tasks and maintain the quality of service.

• Improve efficiency: The M2M interaction provides better efficiency, hence, accurate results can be obtained fast.

This results in saving valuable time. Instead of repeating the same tasks every day, it enables people to do other
creative jobs.

• Saves Money: Optimum utilization of energy and resources can be achieved by adopting this technology and keeping
the devices under surveillance. One can be alerted in case of possible bottlenecks, breakdowns, and damages to the
system.

• Better Quality of Life: The applications of IoT in increased convenience, better management, thereby improving the
quality of life.

Challenges of IoT
• Data Breach: Personal data gets more exposed. For instance: A credit card number being compromised, followed by
a debit card number is stressful. Companies also worry about them and can lose trust if their details are compromised
by their clients.

• Dependence on Technology: IoT is mainly dependent on the internet connection. When there is none, it can’t be
used. On the other hand, we have become primarily dependent on the IoT’s everyday usage.

o IoT has contributed to the great decrease in our attention spans. Today’s generation is already using technology
for every little work to be done making our daily lives mechanized and being controlled by technology.

• Complexity in Operation: IoT manage tasks with ease, but a lot of complex operations are involved in it. If by mistake
the software makes a wrong calculation, this will affect the rest of the process which can be very critical.

o For instance: If one doesn’t know how to deal with the wrong temperature in home. An error code in water dam
software could cause a disastrous flood. That is the reason, many times a mistake in IoT is not always easy to
debug.

• Lesser Employment of Menial Staff: The non-educated workers and helpers may lose their jobs as an effect of
automation of daily activities. This can lead to unemployment in society. With daily activities getting automated,
there will be fewer requirements of human labor, primarily, workers and less educated staff.

Conclusion
In view of the anticipated growth of IoT devices, it is important to ensure that the IoT comply to the safety and security
standards and guidelines in order to protect the users and the networks that connect IoT devices. However, it is one of
the fastest emerging technology, providing enormous beneficial opportunities for society, industry, and consumers and
it will continue to pick up as more people realize the potential of connected devices to keep them competitive.

9. ETHICS
9.1. ETHICS OF METAVERSE


Introduction

In Tamil Nadu, a couple hosted India’s first wedding reception in Metaverse. The bride’s father had passed away but attended
and blessed the couple in a digital avatar at the wedding.

“Not only was I groped last night, but there were other people there who supported this behaviour which made me feel isolated
in the Plaza.” The Plaza here is a digitally created space in the Metaverse.

These two instances highlight the level of integration that can happen between the digital and physical spaces, obviating the
need for understanding and evolving Ethics for Metaverse.

What is metaverse?

Metaverse can be understood as a combination of multiple elements of technology, including virtual reality, augmented reality
and video where users "live" within a digitally enhanced surrounding.

To understand how it works and the impact that it may create, it is important to have clarity on following ideas and technologies-
• Virtual Reality: VR can be understood as the use of computer modelling and simulation
that enables a person to interact with an artificial three-dimensional (3-D) visual or other
sensory environment. E.g., games like World of Warcraft.

• Augmented Reality: Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical
world that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other
sensory stimuli delivered via technology. E.g., games like Pokémon Go.

• Hologram: Holograms are virtual three-dimensional images created by the interference
of light beams that reflect real physical objects. E.g., Holograms used by BJP in the run-
up of 2014 elections.

• Avatar: An avatar in the metaverse is a representation of an individual in the virtual
world, this digital avatar enables the person to function like an actual human being in a digitally created world.

• Platform/Developer/User distinction: In metaverse, digital engagement will get very personal and tailor-
made for the user. In this context, it is important that role played by the platform, the developers and the
users is clearly understood.

How it works?

Using the aforementioned digital tools, the idea of
metaverse aims to connect people, places and things
in multiple environments.

The metaverse enables this by merging virtual,
augmented, and physical reality, and blurs the line
between your interactions online and in real life. It
would enhance our abilities to express pieces of
ourselves through avatars in ways that we may not
have been able to test out before.

What are the potential changes that it may bring?

• Opening up new virtual worlds including virtual economies: Metaverse showcases introduction of multiple virtual
environments designed specifically for and sometimes by the user. This could create dedicated environments such as family
spaces, workspaces, recreation spaces etc.

o Creation of virtual world would translate to creation of virtual economies such as digital assets such as Non-Fungible
Tokens (NFTs), virtual environment developers etc.

110

• Development of new digital cultures: Occupation of a new space by people in physical or digital form leads to creation of
a new culture in that space. How people act and what their preferences are in the metaverse could be totally different than
how they behave in real life.

o Also, these cultures may evolve very differently as they would operate outside direct governmental regulation.

• Usage and processing of data will increase exponentially: Data will be extracted from new sources like behavioural
patterns, idiosyncrasies of physical movement among others. This will increase the volume of data and the amount of
processing it is subjected to.

• Affecting Mental health in both ways: There have been evidences
of virtual world nourishing mental health by aiding in confidence
development, increased tolerance etc. But at the same time, the
seamless integration of the real and virtual worlds has the potential
to aggravate issues such as addiction, anxiety, depression among
others.

• Another dimension to cybercrime and cybersecurity: Metaverse
increases the degree of freedom experienced by its users. This opens
several dimensions of crime i.e., theft of virtual assets, identity theft
in metaverse alongside the already prevalent cybercrime issues.

• Rising environmental burden: The technologies that embody the
metaverse i.e., Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Blockchain and
Big Data among others require significant among of energy. This may
increase pressure on already stressed carbon emissions.

What kind of ethical issues these changes could create?

• Translation of Laws and Rights from Real to Digital space: In the
absence of a regulatory framework in the form of laws or a constitution, it is difficult to understand what are the Rights
that will be protected and how will they be protected.

• Misuse and unfair ownership of data: In a seamless environment such as metaverse, it would be difficult to implement the
current consent based permission structure for private data resulting in muddled ownership of data and increased
vulnerability to misuse.

• Multiplication of the prevalent toxicity: People engage in toxic behaviours such as trolling, bullying and hate speech on
social media. This would multiply further in the metaverse where people will be able to hide behind their avatar or “digital
twin”.

• Psychological issues with multiple Identities: Metaverse would enable the individual to create a digital identity without
the pushes and pulls of the society and the situation one is born in. This could create more identification with the digital
identity leading to issues like self-pity and dissatisfaction with oneself in reality.

• Understanding and managing the intangibility of assets: The idea of virtual assets creates several questions like- who will
own these assets, are these assets transferable across platforms and what about the associated copyright issues.

• Protecting the vulnerable: The vulnerable section, i.e., children, senior citizens and digitally unaware among others are
more vulnerable to influences of the metaverse environment. E.g., hyper-reality experiences could trigger a sensory
overload and induce fits or seizures in users who have a disorder like epilepsy.

• Creating a new class of ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’: The current rate of technological adoption in the form of Internet of Things
(IoT), 5G Technology etc. has aggravated the socio-economic divide. The prevalence of metaverse could create further
divide due to economic capacity, urban-rural gaps etc.

The most important ethical issue among these is to ensure that the digital lives of the participants and connectedly their real
life is not sub-consciously dictated by the platform or the interacting interface.

Principles that could guide ethics of the metaverse
It is evident that the rights, principles and doctrines of the real world may not completely translate to the digital realm. But
following principles could make metaverse a more understandable, safe and inclusive space-
• Do no harm: Enabling testing environments which ensure that the effects of its experience are not harmful.

o A corollary of this principle is to avoid creating content that objectifies, demeans, or violates the rights of humans or
animals.

111
www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS


• Secure the experience: Use the best security protocols and protection to ensure that malicious actors cannot alter or harm
users while they are in the VR experience.

o For example, a community member might get voted off the island if enough token holders think someone is not
operating in a way that adheres to the community guidelines.

• Be transparent about data collection: Ensuring that privacy policies specifically mention Metaverse data and how that data
will be used, shared, and protected.

• Ask for permission: Include permission requests for sensitive data such as eye-tracking, health, and other biometric
information including movement-derived data.

• Diversify representation: Provide a diverse set of avatars to users and ensure that representations of groups and characters
do not perpetuate stereotypes and are free of discriminatory moulds such as racism, casteism, communalism etc.

• Regulate social spaces: Preventing cyberbullying and sexual harassment and ensuring inclusivity through community
guidelines and privacy protections. Projects involving children or other vulnerable populations should be given special
consideration.

• Consider accessibility for all: Include options for those without standard vision, hearing, or movement to enable them to
participate meaningfully in Metaverse experiences. For example, allow users to integrate additional software or hardware
as needed through modular design.

Conclusion
In this dynamically evolving domain, to ensure that these principles are incorporated in both letter and spirit, the platform,
developers and users will have to innovate continuously and proactively.

It is said- ‘In the digital realm, code dictates life’. The time has come when life should dictate the code.
