- ie bulged around [[equator]]
- flattened at poles
- newton proposed this for 1st time (that earth's spinning causes aforementioned phenomena)
- evidences for spherical shape of [[earth]]
	1. circum-nagivation of earth
		- [[ferdinand magellan]] 1519
	2. circlar horizon
	3. ship's visibility from coast
		- also bedford's experiment
	4. sunrise & sunset
		- @ diff times @ diff locations
	5. lunar eclipse
		- [[earth]]'s circular shadow falls on [[moon]]
	6. all other planetary bodies are spherical
		- by using inductive deduction, earth is likely to follow same trend
