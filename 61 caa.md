universal adult franchise
o the indian constitution adopts universal adult franchise as a basis of elections to the lok sabha and the state legislative assemblies.
o every citizen who is not less than 18 years of age has a right to vote without any discrimination of caste, race, religion, sex, literacy,
wealth, and so on. the
the *voting age was reduced to 18 years from 21* years in 1989 by the 61st constitutional amendment act of 1988.
o the introduction of the universal adult franchise by the constitution-makers was a bold experiment and highly remarkable in view of the
vast size of the country, its huge population, high poverty, social inequality and overwhelming illiteracy.
the universal adult franchise makes democracy broad-based, enhances the self-respect and prestige of the common people, upholds
the principle of equality, enables minorities to protect their interests and opens up new hopes and vistas for weaker sections.
o the bill was debated by the lok sabha on 14 and 15 december 1988, and was passed on 15 december.
o the rajya sabha debated the bill on 16, 19 and 20 december 1988 and passed it on 20 december 1988, after adopting the amendment made by the lok sabha. the bill, after ratification by the states, received assent from then president ramaswamy
venkataraman on 28 march 1989.
