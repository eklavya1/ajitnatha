The outstanding Tuluva king was Krishna Deva Raya.
	• During his reign (1509—29) the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers (the Raichur doab) was acquired (1512).
	• The Orissa Hindus were subdued by the capture of Udayagiri (1514) and other towns, and severe defeats were inflicted on the Bijapur sultan.
In [[1565]] Rama Raya, the chief minister of Vijayanagar, led the empire into the fatal battle at Talikota, in which its army was routed by the combined forces of the Muslim states of Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, and Golconda and the city of Vijayanagar was destroyed.
Tirumala, brother of Rama Raya, then seized control of the empire and founded the Aravidu dynasty.
