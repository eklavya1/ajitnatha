# common reference
- b.f. [[geo 27#^db2da1]]

# hot & wet equatorial climate
- 時 - `03:38 pm 30/7/2021`
- high [[humidity]]
- hig temp > 28 deg celc, due to high [[insolation]]
- [[geo 25|rainfall]] > 250 cm due to convectional rainfall
- formation of [[cumulo-nimbus]] clouds, results in heavy raining
- diurnal temp range -highest & lowerst temp diff in a day
- annual temp range
- in this region, diurnal range > annual range 03:46 pm 30/7/2021
- there are no [[winter]]s
- `vegetation`
	- diverse
	- high [[species]] count
	- large variety of plants can grow here --> high temp & high [[precipitation]] 03:48 pm 30/7/2021
	- sunlight is a limitation factor ! --> because of thick tree canopy
	- layered arrangement of trees
	- trees adapted for growing tall
	- sunlight rarely reaches surface 03:51 pm 30/7/2021
	- [[evergreen]] type of vegetation 03:55 pm 30/7/2021, because there is no shortage of precipitation at all [[george friedman]]
	- leaves are very broad--> less sunlight --> so to capture more of it big area you3
	- leaves have big tips, so that falling water drops can leave surface quickly [[adaptation]] [[coniferous]] | [[siberia сибирь]] | 
	- evergreen rain forests 03:59 pm 30/7/2021
# monsoon type

			- savannah grasslands of africa
			- [[sudan]]
			- in [[south 美国 tk]] 04:26 pm 30/7/2021
				- llanos #doubt 
				- campos #doubt 
			- [[australia|au]] - continental interior
			- [[india]] some parts
- summer precipitation
- definite dry winter period
- annual precipitation - 70cm
- vegetation
	- tall grass 04:30 pm 30/7/2021

# mediterranean type
- 時 - `04:53 pm 30/7/2021`
- only type of climate where there is summer dryness & winter precipitation #pre 
- during summer
	- offshore trade winds
- during winter
	- westerlies - onshore winds - bring rain
- _off notes_
- during summers mediterranean region comes under influence of [[offshore trade winds]] with no precipitation
- during winters they are under influence of onshore westerlies which brings precipitation, therefore mediterranean type of climate is characterised by dry summers & wet winters 05:03 pm 30/7/2021
- mediterranean type receives rainfall in winter also due to [[temperate cyclones]]
- vegetation type
	- draught resistant, deep root systems 
	- like citrus fruits (that explains [[french]] wine !!!)--> [[viticulture]] [[medici]] | [[lorenzo]] | [[assassin's creed]]

		- ie why britian was able to develop a strong navy, no iced [[ports]] like [[russia]] 
		- [[geopolitics]]
		- [[george friedman]]
		- [[pax britannica]] ^fc8a92
- brings rainfall throughtout year
- warm [[ocean currents]] make them not too cold
