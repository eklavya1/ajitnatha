- In geometry, a median of a triangle is a line segment joining a [[vertex]] to the midpoint of the opposite side, thus bisecting that side.
- Every triangle has exactly three medians, one from each vertex, and they all intersect each other at the triangle's [[centroid]].
- In the case of isosceles and equilateral triangles, a median bisects any angle at a vertex whose two adjacent sides are equal in length.

The concept of a median extends to tetrahedra.
