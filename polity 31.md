# case of aadhar bill
(05:08 pm)
- court held that it's a money bill as **most important objective** of bill relates to disbursal of funds from consolidated fund of india under **article 110.**
- issues associated with this classification: it can completely bypass rajya sabha in future.
# budgetary process

-   **it includes:**
	-   estimates of [[expenditure]] for coming year
	-   estimates of [[revenue]]s for coming year
	-   actual expenditure & revenue of preceding year
	-   important proposals & policies of govt
-   **article 112(1):** **president** shall in respect of every financial year cause to be laid before both houses of parliament a statement of estimated receipts & expenditure of govt of india for that year, in this part, referred to as **“annual financial statement”.**
-   **article 112(2):** estimates of expenditure embodied in annual financial statement shall show separately-
-   sums required to meet expenditure described by this constitution as expenditure charged upon consolidated fund of india; and
-   sums required to meet other expenditure proposed to be made from consolidated fund of india & shall distinguish expenditure on revenue account from other expenditure.
-   **article 112 (3):** expenditure charged on consolidated fund of india
-   **stages involved**
-   tabling of annual financial statement
-   general discussion:3-5 days; no voting takes place at this stage.
-   parliament will go for break; meanwhile, during break, departmental standing committees scrutinize demands for grants [departmental standing committees- explained in class]
-   report of departmental standing committees containing their recommendations for parliament
-   vote on demand of grants by lok sabha; lok sabha could also impose cuts on demand of grants
-   appropriation bill->  it's a money bill required to withdraw money out of consolidated fund of india.
-   passing of finance bill [finance bill- includes proposals for taxation]
# cut - motions
(5:46 pm)
-   **policy cut:**
-   expresses disapproval to policy of govt; demand is reduced to ₹1
-   if in lok sabha, this policy cut motion is passed then it shows that govt is lacking a majority in lok sabha
-   **economy cut**
-   cut on demand of grant by a certain x amount
-   **token cut**
-   demand for grants is reduced by 100 rupees

# vote on account
(6:06 pm)
-   **it's interim permission given by parliament to govt to spend money.**
-   **constitution says that no money shall be withdrawn by govt from cfi except by law of parliament.**
-   **but, passing of appropriation bill takes time & usually crosses deadline of 31st march.**
-   **meanwhile, govt needs permission to spend money from april 1 onwards when new financial year starts.**
-   **therefore, vote on account is a tool to provide permission to govt to withdraw money from cfi for given period.**
-   **vote on account is a mere formality & no debate happens on same.**

# functioning of parliament
(6:48 pm)

-   11 am -12 pm: question hour- parliament members ask questions to govt ministers
-   **types of questions asked:**
-   starred questions: oral answer to such questions, hence supplementary questions could be asked
-   unstarred questions: written replies to such questions
-   questions to private members
-   short notice questions: notice given for asking such questions is more than 10 days but  less than 21 days
-   zero hour: 12-1 pm; indian parliamentary innovation; discussion may occur on matters of public importance
-   1-2 pm: break
-   2 pm onwards: parliament resumes its business
-   **utility/ importance of question hour**
-   ensures accountability of govt to legislature
-   tool to embarrass govt -> to evoke unprepared responses from minister
-   helps in informing people of country about policies of govt
-   acts as a deterrent for misconduct
-   helps in exposing misdoings of govt
-   **some of concerns associated with question hour**
-   there has been a history of corruption in question hour, where money was charged in lieu of asking uncomfortable questions to govt
-   question hour is biggest casualty of parliamentary proceedings as a lot of disruptions occur during this hour
-   only a small % of questions get answered on floor of house e.g. in 16th lok sabha only 10% of questions were orally answered.
-   only a few questions are admitted by speaker of house 家
# motion & resolutions
(7:14 pm)
-   motions & resolutions are procedural devices to raise a discussion in house on a matter of general public interest.
-   with few exceptions, process of debate in house is initiated by a member or minister by making a motion.
