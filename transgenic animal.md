animals that have had their dna manipulated to possess & express extra (foreign) gene are k/a transgenic animals.
transgenic rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows & fish have been produced, although over 95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice. they have numerous utilities.
normal physiology & development: transgenic animals can be specifically designed to allow study of how genes are regulated, & how they affect normal functions of body & its development.
• e.g. study of complex factors involved in growth such as insulin-like growth factors.
by introducing genes from other species that alter formation of this factor & studying biological effects that result, information is 
obtained about biological role of factor in body.
study of disease:
• many transgenic animals are designed to increase our understanding of how genes contribute to development of disease.
• these are specially made to serve as models for human diseases so that investigation of new treatments for diseases is made possible.
• today transgenic models exist for many human diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis & alzheimer's.
