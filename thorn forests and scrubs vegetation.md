In regions with less than 70 cm of [[rainfall]], the natural [[vegetation]] consists of thorny trees and bushes.
This type of vegetation is found in the north-western part of the [[country]], including semi-arid areas of [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[haryana]].
Acacias, palms, euphorbias and cacti are the main plant species.
Trees are scattered and have long roots penetrating deep into the soil in order to get moisture. The stems are succulent to conserve water. Leaves are mostly thick and small to minimize evaporation. These forests give way to thorn forests and scrubs in arid areas.
In these forests, the common animals are rats, mice, rabbits, fox, wolf, tiger, lion, wild ass, horses and camels.
