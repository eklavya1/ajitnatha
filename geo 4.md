Geography Class 04

REVISION OF THE LAST CLASS (01:11 PM).

Seasons.
IDL.

DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME (01:30 PM).

It is the practice of shifting time by 1 hour ahead by forwarding the time in the clock during Summers.
It is practiced in those regions where the length of the day varies between summers and winters i.e. in temperate regions.

LEAP SECOND (01:38 PM).

UTC (The Coordinated Universal Time) is based on TAI (International Atomic Time based on the vibrations of an atomic or molecular system) and UT1 (The astronomical time based on the earth's rotation).
Once in a while, the earth's rotation slows down. To accommodate the slowing down, TAI is slowed down for 1 second so that the earth catches up.
To slow down TAI we need to add one extra second which is called as the Leap Second.

UNIVERSE (02:23 PM).

It is the limitless expanse of space surrounding us consisting of the solar systems, stars, galaxies, etc.
The Universe has around 100-400 billion galaxies with each galaxy having 100-400 billion stars.
Origin of the Universe:
Steady-state Theory-
Proposed by Fred Hoyle.
The overall size and mass of the universe remain constant at any point of time.
The universe has no beginning and no end and is always expanding.
There is a continuous creation of new stars and galaxies at the rate old ones become unobservable.
Pulsating Theory-
Proposed by Arthur Eddington.
As per the theory Universe expands and contracts alternatively.
It expands because of explosion and contracts because of gravitational pull.
The Universe is currently in the phase of expansion.
Big Bang theory-
It was proposed by Gorgeous Lemaitry in 1927.
According to the theory, 13.7 billion years ago, the Universe was an extremely compact, dense, and hot singularity. There was no matter, no space, and no time.
13.7 billion years ago, a cosmic explosion happened called as Bing bang.
From that time Universe started to expanse and is still continuing today.
First, the forces of Physics such as Gravity came into existence, and then the elementary particles, atoms, molecules, gaseous compounds, stars, and galaxies.
Hubble, in 1929, proposed that all observable stars and galaxies are moving away from earth. He discovered this through the phenomenon of Red Shift.
The rate of expansion of stars is called Hubble's constant.
Life Cycle of a Star (03:23 PM):
Stellar Nebula-
A giant cloud of gas and dust mainly consisting of hydrogen.
The gas is pulled together by gravity and the entire nebula starts to spin because of the gravitational pull.
Proto-Star-
The spinning gaseous mass reaches high temperature resulting in the formation of a hot core called as ProtoStar.
Birth of a star-
When the temperature crosses 15 million degrees, a nuclear fusion reaction starts at the center/core.
Red-Giant-
When the supply of hydrogen runs out the core of normal star contracts, and simultaneously the outer shell expands resulting in Red-Giant.
If it is a low mass star with less than 10 times the mass of the sun the core collapses leading to the formation of a planetary nebula
If it is an average star with less than 10 times the mass of the Sun, the core of the Red giant collapses and leads to the formation of a Planetary nebula which is a spherical shell of gas.
After some time, only the core is left inside the shell, which is called as White dwarf, which is theorized to become a Black dwarf in the later stage. 
Red Super-Giant-
If the mass of a star is more than 10 times the Sun, it becomes a Red Supergiant.
Supernova-
A Red Supergiant will undergo a massive explosion due to the collapse of the core called a Supernova explosion.
If the remnant core after the Supernova explosion is between 1.4 to 3 times the mass of the sun, it leads to the formation of a neutron star, which is a very heavy dense body consisting of closely packed neutrons.
If the remnant core after the supernova explosion is more than 3 times the mass of the sun, the core collapses under gravity leading to the formation of a black hole.
A black hole is a body with infinite gravity and density that even the light can not escape from it.

The topic for the next class= Solar System; Geomorphology.
