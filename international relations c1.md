2. idealism school of thought = how things should be rather than how things are, more descriptive, based on moral principles, & international cooperation should be guiding factor in international politics.

2:20 pm: how to promote suggested ways for ensuring peace:
1. balance of power = suggested by realist school of thought, there should be 4 or 5 global powers who enjoyed power parity, so these global powers will not allow any country to become more powerful & if any country attempts to do so other countries will come together to punish perpetrator.

smart power = hard power + soft power
if trade were conducted in cultural terms, india would have a thumping trade surplus. by sashi tharoor
during very 1st decade of india's independence when its hard power credentials, be it military or economic power were negligible, india could still carve a niche for itself in international affairs, through innovative idea of non-alignment (nam) & consequently nam it emerged as leader of 3rd world.
smart power = joseph nye realizes that either of 2 powers is sub-optimal on their own therefore later he gave idea of smart power as judicial mix of two.
