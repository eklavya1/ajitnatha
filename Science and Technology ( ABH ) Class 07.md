Science and Technology ( ABH ) Class 07

Defence Technology (1:18 PM)

The success of DRDO is lacking at the level of the ISRO.
The opaque nature of the defence deals reduces the efficiency and effectiveness.
Lack of incentive.
Lack of funds and technology sharing agreement with other countries in defence technology.
The Chairman of ISRO is also chairman of the Space Commission and secretary of the Department of Space (DOS). Contrasting with the DRDO, which functions under the ministry of defence and is entrenched with the bureaucratic culture.

Missile Technology

It is a rocket-propelled weapon designed to deliver an explosive warhead with great accuracy and high speed. It has four major components that are Missile Guidance System, Flight System, Engine and War Head.
Types of Missiles
Based on launch platform and target: Surface to surface missile (Prithvi), Surface to Air Missile (Barak and Aakash), Air to Air Missile (Ashtra) and Anti-Tank Missile (Nag).
Based on the Range: It is classified as Short Range, Medium Range, Intermediate-Range, and Long Range. Long-range missiles are also known as intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Short Range: Less than 1000 Km: Prithvi
Medium Range: Between 1000 to 3000 Km: Agni 1
Intermediate-Range: Between 3000 to 5000 Km: Agni 2, 3 and 4
Long Range: More Than 5000 Km: Agni 5
Based on the speed: They could be of three types: Subsonic Mac 1, Supre Sonic (around Mac 3) Akash Missile, Hypersonic missile More than 5 Mac, Brahmos II as examples.
Countries are experimenting to attain hypersonic speed. The missile at hypersonic speed is very difficult to detect.
Examples of the Missile Defence System (Iron dome System) of Israel.
Based on the trajectory: It could be classified under the Ballistic vs. Cruise Missile.
Ballistic Missiles
These missiles are guided for a brief duration just in starting phase and the rest of the path is like a free-falling projectile under gravity.
The path of such a missile is parabolic.
These missiles save fuel, can hit a target that is very far away.
It can also carry a huge amount of warhead.
However, they can be intercepted by Radars and are more suitable for stationary targets. Prithvi and all Agni missiles are examples of Ballistic missiles.
In a ballistic missile, the path of the missile is guided by gravity. This type of missile required very small guidance.
Cruise Missile:
It is guided missile which remains in the atmosphere and flies the major portion of its flight at an approximately constant speed.
They are not guided by gravity.
They are highly accurate fast and difficult to intercept by the radars.
However, they require continuous guidance and consume more fuel and the range is not high as a ballistic missile. Nirbhay and Brahmos are examples of it.
Its path is not guided by gravity.
It is important to hit a target that is moving. Cruise missiles are difficult to get detected by the RADAR system.
It is for the short-range destination.

Integrated Guided Missile Programme  (2:26 PM)

It was envisaged by Dr Kalam in 1983 to help India attain self-sufficiency in the field of missile technology.
5 Missiles have been developed under this programme are Agni, Aakash, Prithvi, Trishul and Nag. In 2008 DRDO announce the successful completion of the programme.
Detail regarding all these missiles will be uploaded at the student portal.

Ballistic Missile Defence Programme         (2:30 PM)

DRDO is developing a two-tier Ballistic Missile System that will provide a multi-layered shield against ballistic missile attacks.
The two-tier system is intended to destroy an incoming missile at a higher altitude in the exo-atmosphere and if this miscarriage an endo-atmospheric interception will take place.
Prithvi and Aswin Missile are being used for this Ballistic Missile Defence Programme.

The weaponization of the Space     (3:02 PM)

It refers to aggressive and offensive use of space systems for military purposes.
Though the space has been indirectly used during warfare such as Surveillance, communication, etc. More and more direct uses of space for warfare is being witnessed. For example, there is a race between US and China to weaponize space. This includes anti-satellite tests, hypersonic missiles, small satellites to spy on the satellite systems, using a platform in space to destroy targets in space or earth.
In this context, the governance framework led by Outer Space Treaty (1967) is increasingly in strain to prevent the weaponization of space.
It does not define the limit of outer space.
It does not specify what constitutes peaceful use of outer space and the weaponisation of outer space.
Space capabilities of the countries have been significantly increased since its inception.
Attempts of negotiations to prohibit weapons in space have failed again and again.
There is a need for a rule-based order which can reflect the rapid and dramatic changes in the use of the space.
Like-minded countries should link up UN bodies and start a new process for a global code of conduct to establish norms and regulate behaviour in space.
Air Breathing Engine: RAMJET and SCRAMJET are examples of it. It takes oxygen inputs directly from the atmosphere to reduce the weight of spacecraft. It enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the spacecraft. For RAMJET the combustion takes place at a very slow speed. SCRAMJET the combustion takes place at a higher speed.

Submarines       (3:31 PM)

These are vessels capable of propelling themselves beneath the water as well as on the water surface.
They can have both military and civilian applications. For example, attacking an enemy ship or submarine can carry ballistic missiles, it can also be used for the seafloor exploration and marine sciences.
They can be classified as diesel-electric powered, and nuclear submarines.
Diesel Powered Submarine of India: Sindhughosh Class that was built under the contract between India and Russia. INS Sindhudhvaj, INS Sindhughos, ANS Sindhu Ashtra, INS Sindhuvijay are examples of this class of submarine.
Scorpene class submarines are a class of diesel-electric attack submarines jointly developed by DCNS (A French Company) and Mazgon Doc. Limited (Indian Company). It is part of Project 75 of the Navy.
INS Kalveri, Kandheri, Karanja, Vagin, and are part of this project 75.

Benefits of the Scorpene Class Submarine  

These are fast attacking submarines that can sustain very heavy water pressure. They have very low acoustics. Thus they cannot be easily detected.
They are air independent, which means they can remain in the water for a longer duration.
For navigation, it not only uses GPS but also GLONASS. When Galileo will be operational then it will be also used. Thus it will reduce the margin of errors for navigation.

Nuclear Powered Submarine      

These are powered by small nuclear reactors. They can stay in oceans for a long period without refuelling. They can be propelled with very high speed.
INS ARIHANT and INS ARIGHAT are examples of Nuclear Powered Submarines.
INS ARIHANT has a pressurised water reactor and is capable of carrying a missile with a nuclear warhead. (Killer 4 (K4) Missile)
India has completed nuclear Tried with INS ARIHANT. Now India is capable of launching nuclear weapons from land, water and air also,

The topic for the next class discussion: Defence will be completed, Intellectual Property Right (IPR).
