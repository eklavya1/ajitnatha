it's simply based on assumption of unlimited supply of [[labor]].
âˆ´, wages would be low & hence [[country]] must invest in [[labor]]-intensive [[industry]] rather than [[capital]]-intensive industry so that it can exploit its competitive advantage. 
[[premature deindustrialization]]- reason for this is that output produced with a mix of labor & capital is not optimal. in this, less output will be produced & some other country will replace & take over by applying this optimal mix. industry in country will decline *before reaching its optimum level of output.*
