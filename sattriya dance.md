- sattriya (assamese: সত্ৰীয়া), or sattriya  nritya, is a major indian classical dance. it is a dance-drama performance art with origins in the krishna-centered [[vaishnavism]] monasteries of [[assam]], and attributed to the [[15th century]] bhakti movement scholar and saint mahapurush srimanta sankardev.one-act plays of sattriya are called ankiya nat, which combine the aesthetic and the religious through a ballad, dance and drama. the plays are usually performed in the dance community halls (namghar) of monastery temples (sattras). the themes played are related to [[lord krishna]], sometimes other vishnu avatars such as rama and sita  and stories from the epics (mahabharata and ramayana) are also referred to. the philosophic religion of mahapurush srimanta sankaradeva was based on vedanta, bhagavadgītā and the bhāgavata purāna, so there is no presence of radha in sattriya dance presentations.

in 2000, the sangeet natak akademi of india recognized sattriya as a classical dance.  modern sattriya explores many themes and plays, and its performances are staged worldwide.
