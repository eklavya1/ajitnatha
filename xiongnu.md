- the xiongnu (chinese: 匈奴; pinyin: xiōngnú, [ɕjʊ́ŋ.nǔ]) were a tribal confederation of nomadic peoples who, according to ancient chinese sources, inhabited the eastern eurasian steppe from the [[3rd century]] bc to the late 1st century ad. touman, who led xiongnu 220-211 bce, is the first known leader of the xiongnu empire.after their previous rivals, the yuezhi, migrated to west into central asia during the 2nd century bc, the xiongnu became a dominant power on the steppes of east asia, centred on the mongolian plateau. the xiongnu were also active in areas now part of siberia, inner mongolia, gansu and xinjiang. their relations with adjacent central plain dynasties to the south-east were complex, with repeated periods of conflict and intrigue, alternating with exchanges of tribute, trade and marriage treaties (heqin). chinese historians names the tribes of non-chinese origin as the "five barbarians". the xiongnu which we today evidently know were speaking mongolic turkic languages, were thereby listed as one the five barbarians.

as xiongnu left very little written history of their own, only the new archeological, anthropological and genetic research helps to identify their links to the modern day ethnic groups and languages, therefore the identity of the ethnic core of xiongnu is still subject to varied hypotheses. in the chinese sources. the name xiongnu may be cognate with that of the huns and/or the huna, although this is disputed. other linguistic links—all of them also controversial—proposed by scholars include iranian, mongolic, turkic, uralic, yeniseian, or multi-ethnic.
