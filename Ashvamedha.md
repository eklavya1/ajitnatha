[[古历史]]
The Ashvamedha अश्वमेध is a Sanskrit word and in this Yagna a [[horse]] sacrifice ritual followed by the then Srauta tradition as per the Vedic culture. It was used by ancient Indian kings to prove their imperial sovereignty on whole states wherever the [[horse]] passes.

A [[horse]] after worshiped by the Vedic rules after Yagna was released, accompanied by the king's warriors for [[horse]] safety for a period of one year. In the territory traversed by the [[horse]], any rival could dispute the king's authority by challenging the warriors accompanying it. It was also rule that after travelling one year, if it is not stopped by any rival group the [[horse]] was re back to the king Place. Then King would sacrificed the [[horse]] and then it was declared that the King was an undisputed mighty King of whole earth. Ischavaku vansh King had done so many Aswamedhya Yagna. Bhagwaan Sri Ram had performed also several such Yagna and that is why, he is considered as the Chakravoty King of whole earth.
