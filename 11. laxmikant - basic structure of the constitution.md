[[a368 Power of Parliament to amend the Constitution and procedure therefor]]
[[kesavananda bharati case]]
The Judiciary advanced the theory of the basic structure in the famous case of Kesavananda Bharati. This ruling has contributed to the evolution of the Constitution in the following ways:

It has set specific limits to Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. It says that no amendment can violate the basic structure of the Constitution;

It allows Parliament to amend all parts of the [[constitution]] (within this limitation); and It places the Judiciary as the final authority in deciding if an amendment violates basic structure and what constitutes the basic structure.

The Supreme Court gave the Kesavananda ruling in [[1973]]. In the past four decades, this decision has govemed all interpretations of the Constitution and all institutions in the country have accepted the theory of basic structure. In fact, the theory of basic structure is itself an example of a living constitution. There is no mention of this theory in the Constitution. It has emerged from judicial interpretation. Thus, the Judiciary and its interpretation have practically amended the Constitution without a formal amendment.

In the late nineties, efforts were made to review the entire Constitution. In the year [[2000]], a commission to review the working of the Constitution was appointed by the Government of India under the chairmanship of a retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Venkatachaliah. Opposition parties and many other organizations boycotted the commission. While a lot of political controversies surrounded this commission, the commission stuck to the theory of basic structure and did not suggest any measures that would endanger the basic structure of the Constitution. This shows the significance of the basic structure doctrine in our constitutional practice.
