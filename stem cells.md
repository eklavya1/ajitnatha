    - What are Stem Cells? They Special human cells that have the capability to develop into wide-ranging types of cells in the human body, from muscle cells to brain cells, are called stem cells.
    - What are the 2 unique properties of Stem Cells?
        - A stem cell is an immature or unspecialized cell that can split to form similar cells.
        - They develop into different specialized cells that perform a distinct function.
    - What are the different types of Stem Cells? There are 3 types under this classification

        - Embryonic stem cells
        - Adult stem cells
        - Induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSC’s

    - What are Embryonic Stem cells? These are the Stem cells that exist only during the earliest stage of development.
    - What are Adult Stem Cells? These are the cells that can multiply when there is a need to repair adult organs and tissues.These cells are present in almost all organs of the human body.
        - They are multipotent i.e. they can give rise to a limited number of mature cell types, usually corresponding to the tissues in which they reside. A most well-known example is the blood-forming (hematopoietic) stem cells from bone marrow that give rise to different blood cells in our body.
        - Some tissue-specific stem cells can only give rise to one or two mature cell types and are called unipotent and bipotent, respectively. Stem cells found in the skin produce new skin cells and are an example of unipotent stem cells.
    - What are induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC’s)? These cells are not found in the body but made in the laboratory from cells of the body. The iPSC cells have properties similar to those of embryonic stem cells. Human iPSC’s were generated in 2007.
        - iPSCs are adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell–like state by being forced to express genes and factors important for maintaining the defining properties of embryonic stem cells. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
        - iPSC are derived from skin or blood cells that have been reprogrammed back into an embryonic-like pluripotent state that enables the development of an unlimited source of any type of human cell needed for therapeutic purposes.
