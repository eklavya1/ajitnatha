World History Class 10

IMPACTS OF WORLD WAR 1(1:02 PM):

Impacts on China and Japan:

Japan captured the German pacific islands, the Kiaochow islands, and the Shantung province of China.
May 4th movement 1919 in China against  Japanese imperialism.
Washington Conference 1921 led to the recognition of Japanese control of the German pacific islands and China getting back Kiaochow and Shantung.
Also, Japan was now an important pacific power.
European economies were devastated by world war I  and the European exports markets were captured by Japan and USA, so the Japanese economy benefited.
This was because the war was not fought on American and Japanese soil.

IMPACT ON RUSSIA (1:12 PM):

Russia was heavily defeated by Germany in World War 1.
Also, there was high inflation and food shortage in Russia which led to bread-riots in cities.
This severely affected the morale of the people.
There was disaffection in the army against the Czar.
These factors led to the overthrow of the monarchy in Russia through the February revolution of 1917.
The provisional government that came to power after Czar was overthrown by communists led by Lenin in the October revolution in 1917.
People of Russia and many in the Russian army wanted an exit from world war 1.
Also, Lenin believed that world war 1 was a result of capitalism as he deemed colonies equal to export markets and sources of raw materials.

So Lenin signed  the treaty of Brest Litovsk(1917) with Germany whereby:

Russia exited world war 1.
The treaty was very harsh and Russia lost Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Georgia to Germany.
During Russian Civil War( 1918 -1920), Russia won back Ukraine and Georgia.
The Treaty of Versailles (1920) however did not return the rest to Russia, and these countries emerged as independent countries.

SEEDS OF COLD WAR SOWN (1:29 PM):

After Lenin captured powers, other political parties started a civil war (1918-1920) to remove the Bolsheviks from power.

In the civil war, capitalist USA Britain, France, and Japan invaded Russia  because:

Allied powers wanted a revival of two fronts against Germany by removing Lenin from power and making Russia re-enter world war 1.
Communism believed at the end of capitalism and also the spread of the communist revolution to the whole world, i.e. the global defeat of capitalism.
Therefore, the capitalist allied powers did not want communism to survive in Russia.
Also, Lenin had sent secret agents to the rest of Europe and even to some colonies of the capitalist world to incite the communist revolution.
Bolsheviks won the civil war 1918-1920, therefore the birth of the first communist country in the world USSR- the Union of Soviet  Socialist Republics.
There were 15 Socialist Republics(SRs )as  SR of Russia, SR of Ukraine, SR of Armenia, SR of Azerbaijan.

IMPACTS ON USA(1:40 PM):

There was a rise of the USA as an economic superpower.
The USA was already a top economic power by 1914.
European exports markets were captured by USA and japan as European countries were devastated.
The USA also gave loans to many European countries to fight the war.
Therefore western Europe came under the influence of the USA.
The USA played a lead role in negotiating the Treaty of Versailles.
League of Nations(LON) was a project of USA president Woodrow Wilson.
However, once the Republicans came to power, the USA reverted back to the policy of isolation, did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles, and did not join LON as it did not want to be a part of the political and military conflicts of Europe.
The world became more dangerous as new weapons were been the norm.
People’s outlook towards war changed after the high devastations. Public sentiments were anti-war.
This led to pressure on democratic governments to avoid wars. This led to the Policy of Appeasement during inter-war years which later aided in the rise of fascist rulers like Hitler, Mussolini, etc.

EFFECTS ON GERMANY (1:58 PM):

German Revolution (1918):

When Germany was about to lose world war 1, Kaiser abdicated the throne and the monarchy ended.
Socialist parties formed a government and surrendered in November 1918 by signing an armistice.
The constitution of this government was drafted in the city of Weimar, and hence it was called the government of the Weimar Republic. 
The Weimar Republic represented Germany in the Treaty of Versailles.

TREATY OF VERSAILLES (TOV) (2:04 PM):

Germany was humiliated and TOV was very harsh.
Weimar representatives were not even allowed to speak during the negotiations.
They could only submit their demands only in writing, most of which were not accepted.

No Arms-

Germany could have no tanks, submarines airplanes, and only six battleships were allowed and a maximum of 1 lakh soldiers.
Germany cannot have conscription.
Germany was hence disarmed and it lost the capacity of self-defense.
Rhineland was demilitarized to create a buffer between French and German armies so that France has enough early- warning in the case of future German attacks.

No colonies:

Germany lost all colonies- German Pacific islands were taken over by Japan, German East Africa was given to Britain and Belgium.
German Southwest Africa to South Africa (Under British Empire)
Cameroon and Togoland to France.
Alsace Loraine was returned to France.
The coal-rich Saar region (90 % German ethnic population) was kept under the League Of Nations administration for 15 years, after which there was to be a referendum where people will decide on joining France or Germany.
France had the right to use the coal of Saar for 15 years.

No Territories:

Some German territory was also given to  DBPL- Denmark, Belgium, Poland, and Lithuania.
Danzig, an important port city was brought under LON administration as the “Free City of Danzig”, so that Poland could have access to this port.
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland were made independent.

No money:

6600 million pounds war reparations. Most of the benefits were to go to France.
The war guilt clause legally put the responsibility of world war 1 on Germany.
The union between Austria and Germany (Anschluss) was barred.

IMPACT ON AUSTRIA HUNGARY (2: 50 PM):

Just before the end of world war 1, Austria and Hungary separated.
Treaty of Saint Germain was signed with Austria and the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary.
Now Austria and Hungary were reduced to a very small size as territory was taken to create new ethnicity-based nations.
For example- Poland( it had some territories from Austria Hungary, some from Germany, and some territories from Russia, which were held by Germany) Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia(It had some territories of Austria Hungary empire, Serbia, and Montenegro), and some territories to Romania.
Czechs and Slovaks were made part of one country to make an economically viable Czechoslovakia.

IMPACT ON OTTOMAN EMPIRE (2:56 PM):

Treaty of Severes:

Ottoman empire was reduced to a very small Turkey.
Arab territories were given to Britain and France.
Britain got- Trans Jordan, Palestine, Iraq.
France got Syria.
Some territories were given to Italy and significant territories were given to Greece including Turk populated areas of eastern Thrace and Smyrna on the Turkish mainland.

### Criticism of the peace treaties
### Principle of self-determination:
It was the basis of the creation of new nations in Europe taking away territories from central powers.
However, this principle was not followed for central powers and for Arabs and colonies.
Many Germans now lived outside Germany. Austria Germany Anschluss was barred.
Sudetenland of Austria- Hungary empire was given to Czechoslovakia, Saar, and Danzig to the League of Nations.
Many Turk-populated territories were given to Greece.
Arabs felt cheated as they were not given independence.
There was no self-determination for colonies as imperialism continued.

### Principle of economic viability
It was argued that the principle of self-determination was largely followed, and exceptions were made to have economic viability for new nations. For example- Sudetenland was rich and Danzig port given to LON for trade of Poland.
Due to its small size, Austria was not economically viable, and its economy suffered post world war 1. The union between Austria and Germany made economic sense but was still barred. That was because France wanted to keep Germany economically weak permanently.

### Principle of universal disarmament
It was a goal of LON, as an international organization to maintain world peace. It was the guarantor of the treaties of Versailles. However, it was only Germany that was disarmed, and therefore Germany lost the ability of self-defense.
*Therefore the treaty of Versailles humiliated Germany, was unfair and sowed the seeds of future conflicts which culminated in world war 2.*

### League Of Nations
It was created on the principles of collective security i.e.world powers would come to aid of victims of aggression to punish the aggressor.
However, LON did not have its own army. Also soon after its creation, the military contribution by members for collective security was made voluntary.
Post world war 1, nations wanted to avoid war and focus on war recovery. So the idea of collective security failed as aggressions by fascist powers later went unpunished.
LON was not truly representative as Germany and Russia were not made its members. This hurt the image of LON as it was not seen as an unbiased organization.
It also hurt the ability of LON to resolve disputes peacefully where Germany and Russia were involved.

## Peace treaties failed to achieve even short-term peace:

### Italian unhappiness/ Impact on Italy
Italian unhappiness/ Impact on Italy(3:40 PM):

Italy was not given the promised territories after world war 1. So there was anger in Italians over the Treaty of Versailles.
The economy was in turmoil due to high war expenditures and the burden of USA loans taken to fight World War 1.
There was high inflation and unemployment.
Also, there was a fear of the communist revolution as the support for the communists increased with economic turmoil.
In this context, Mussolini projected himself as the savior of capitalism and came to power in [[1922]] which saw the birth of Fascism.
Mussolini promised revenge and adopted an aggressive foreign policy.

### Corfu Incident
An Italian member of the boundary commission of LON investigating boundary disputes between Greece and Albania was killed in an incident.
Mussolini demanded compensation and started bombing Greece.
Britain and France wanted to avoid war, therefore they coaxed Greece to pay the compensation (Failure of LON).

### Fiume 1944

Fiume was under the joint administration of Italy and Yugoslavia.
Mussolini threatened Yugoslavia with war and took over Fiume.

### Turkish nationalism
Straits of Dardanelles were permanently opened by the Treaty of Versailles.
Turks rose under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and they ended the rule of  Khalifa and also defeated Greece to win back Turk populated areas- Eastern Thrace and Smyrna.

French occupation of Ruhr of Germany (1923):
