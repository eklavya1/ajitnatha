- • Zinc–air batteries are metal–air batteries powered by oxidizing zinc with oxygen from the air. These batteries have high [[energy]] densities.
 - • Zinc-air cells work like conventional batteries in that they generate electrical power from chemical reactions. But instead of packing the necessary ingredients inside the cell, zinc-air batteries get one of their main reactants-oxygen-from the outside air. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
 - • Zinc-air batteries are relatively inexpensive to produce and are up to five times cheaper than lithium-ion. 
 - • Unlike some batteries used in wireless devices, zinc-air cells contain no toxic compounds and are neither highly reactive nor flammable. In fact, they can be recycled, safely disposed of, or in some [[_cases moc]], recharged with new zinc.
