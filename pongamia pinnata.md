Oil extracted from the Pongamia Pinnata seeds is the best substitute for [[kerosene]] for lighting lamps in rural areas.
The oil extracted has yet not used on a commercial level, but due to an increase in awareness and growth in research, Pongamia can be developed as an alternative source of fuel
that can replace diesel from the market.
The oil extracted is commonly known as 'Karanja oil'.
Pongamia Pinnata is adaptable to arid zones, hence grows naturally in most of the arid regions of India.
Reasons for using Pongamia Pinnata as a source of bio-diesel:
	It has a good nitrogen-fixing ability.
	The plant has the ability to grow in waterlogged, saline, and alkaline soil, wasteland and can withstand harsh agro climates.
	Pongamia Pinnata seeds contain 30% - 40% oil and little amount of free fatty acids. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for approx. 63% and 23%, respectively, of the seed oil and Oleic acid, is the major fatty acid found in the P. Pinnata seeds.
