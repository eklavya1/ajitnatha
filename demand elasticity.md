- [[demand]] elasticity is *sensitivity of [[demand]] for a good or service due to a change in another factor.*
- economists measure demand elasticity to determine how consumer behaviour & spending patterns are affected when specific factors are considered.
- *a good that has a high demand elasticity for an economic variable means that consumer demand for that good is more responsive to changes in variable.*
- *conversely, a good with low demand elasticity means that regardless of changes in an economic variable, consumers don't adjust their spending patterns.*
## various factors which affect elasticity of demand of a commodity are:
### type of good
• a commodity for a person may be a necessity, a comfort or a luxury.
• when a commodity is a necessity/ basic like food grains, vegetables, medicines, etc., its demand is generally inelastic as it is required for human survival & its demand
elasticity is either low or inelastic.
• when a commodity is a comfort like a fan, refrigerator, etc., its demand is generally elastic as consumers can postpone its consumption.
• when a commodity is a luxury like ac, dvd player, etc., its demand is generally more elastic as compared to demand for comforts.
### availability of substitutes
• demand for a commodity with a large number of substitutes will be more elastic.
• on other hand, commodities with few or no substitutes like wheat & salt have less price elasticity of demand.
### income level
• elasticity of demand for any commodity is generally less for higher income level groups in comparison to people with low incomes.
• but, poor people are highly affected by an increase or decrease in price of goods. as a result, demand for lower-income groups is highly elastic.
### price
• one factor that can affect demand elasticity of a good or service is its price level.
• for example, change in price level for a luxury car can cause a substantial change in quantity demanded.
### number of uses
• if commodity under consideration has several uses, then its demand will be elastic.
### habits
• commodities, which have become habitual necessities for consumers, have less elastic demand.
