Members of the State Legislative Assembly have many authorities and privileges that are equivalent to those granted to members of Parliament, although these powers and functions are limited to that particular State.

Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are the six states that have a Legislative Council.
The J&K Legislative Council was abolished in 2019 as a result of the J&K Reorganisation Bill, which reduced the state of J&K to the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh.
