Contempt of court is the offence of *being defiant or disrespectful to the court of law*. Being impolite to legal authorities in the courtroom, or rebelliously failing to follow a court order may draw Contempt of Court proceedings. A judge can levy sanctions such as a penalty or prison for someone found guilty of contempt of court.
This was in news regarding comments made on social media against the CJI by Prashant Bhushan for which he faced criminal contempt of court. There are different aspects to this debate over contempt of court. While several countries have termed such laws as obsolete and archaic, the large number of contempt cases in Indian courts and the need to insulate and safeguard the judiciary are the reasons in favour of contempt laws.
In the age of social media, the balance between freedom of speech and anything that ‘scandalises’ the court has to be revisited. The Supreme Court and the High Courts derive their power from the constitution of India while the procedure is outlined in the Contempt of Court, Act, 1971.
The Law Commission has recommended that it should be restricted only to civil contempt.
