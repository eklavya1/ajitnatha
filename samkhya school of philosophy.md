Samkhya school of philosophy is the oldest school of philosophy and was founded by Kapil Muni who is supposed to have written the Samkhya Sutra
This school believed in dualism or dvaitavada, i.e. the soul and the matter are separate entities.
This concept is the basis of all real knowledge.
The Samkhya school went through two phases of development, i-e_ Original Samkhya view and the New Samkhya view.
Both the schools argued that salvation could be attained through the acquisition of knowledge.
Knowledge can be acquired through tiree main concepts: Pratyaksha (perception), Anumana (inference), and Shabda (hearing)_
This school has been famous for its scientific system of inquiry.
The final philosophy argued that Prakriti and Purusha are the basis of reality and they are absolute and independent.
As Purusha is closer to the attributes of a male, it is associated with consciousness and cannot be changed or altered.
Conversely, Prakriti consists of three major attributes: thought, movement and transformation.
These attributes make it closer to the physiognomy of a woman.
