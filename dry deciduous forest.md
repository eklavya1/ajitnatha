Dry deciduous forest covers vast areas of the country, where rainfall ranges between 70-100 cm.
On the wetter margins, it has a transition to the moist deciduous, while on the drier margins to thorn forests.
These forests are found in rainier areas of the Peninsula and the plains of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
