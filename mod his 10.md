# ii maratha war
• by [[1795]] - young madhav rao ii commits suicide, cuz of high-handed attitude of fadnis.
• this led to increased factionalism in maratha polity
• [[1796]]- bajirao ii becomes peshwa & he wants to get rid of fadnis
• which adds to the disunity among maratha sardars
• [[1800]]- death of fadnis
	• this further inc disunity
	• some sardars supported, some objected to bajirao ii as peshwa
• bajirao ii seeks help of eic in the 2nd maratha war
• (because of lack of modern polity, the system becomes personality driven)

result-
	1. bajirao ii signed subsidiary alliance [[1903]] eic now protects him
	2. eic won
	3. scindhia of [[gwalior]]
		a. was made to s.a. ([[subsidiary alliance]])
		b. lost all territory north of [[jamuna]] [[1803]] 
			i. (i.e. [[delhi]] under [[eic]]) 
			ii. (since [[1752]], delhi was under protection of [[maratha]]s
		c. lost his territory in [[gujarat]] (annexed) 1803
	4. orissa captured by eic
		a. bhonsle of [[nagpur]]
	5. s.a. (subsidiary alliance) with tributaries of maratha
		a. [[jats]]
		b. [[rajputs]]
		c. [[bundelas]]

--------
# iii maratha war
1. reason - bajirao ii wanted [[independence]]  from influence of eic
2. because he has been a [[puppet]] since [[1803]] (s.a. (subsidiary alliance)
3. he rallied maratha sardars against eic, led to 3rd war
4. [[peshwa]]'s territory annexed & [[peshwaship]] abolished
5. s.a. (subsidiary alliance) with holkar of indore + with bhonsle of nagpur (scindhia signed in 1803)
	a. [[1802]]- gaikwads of baroda signed s.a. in return for eic help in succession dispute
	b. significant territories of holkar & bhonsle annexed

==(e=e, weaken the land holding power, you weaken the opponent.)==
[[e=e]]
- monetary power is one of the most important component of a ruler. with its loss, you also loose the physical component of power.

to summarize-

anglo-maratha war 
[[1775]]-82
[[1803]]-05
[[1817]]-19

1. weak peshwas led to decline in the centralised authority among marathas which bred disunity
2. mistake of marathas
	a. for selfish interests, certain maratha leaders sought help of eic, therefore allowed eic an opportunity to interfere & ultimately bring marathas under their control
3. marathas 没有 any 力, regional allies
	a. cuz of policy of loot 和 plunder & territorial disputes _related_ [[loot and plunder policy]] [[mongol]] [[aryan]] [[mahmud ghazni]]
4. since [[1750]] onwards, eic 开始 maintaining 自 army 
	a. moreover this [[army]] was modern and technically updated, this gave an advantage to the brits [[abdali]] [[genghis khan]] [[india’s ancient past#^98863b]] [[united states of america]]
