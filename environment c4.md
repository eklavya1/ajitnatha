# ******************************

# Water cycle
(1.17 PM)
- or hydrological cycle
- [[water]] is cycled in three forms ice, water(l), & water vapor.
- [[ocean]]s contain more than about 70% of water.
- remaining water is found in polar ice, mountain glaciers, surface waters, groundwater.
- important processes in water cycle are evaporation, cloud formation, condensation, precipitation.
- Respiration: C6H12O6+6O2 =6CO2+6H2O. 
- Transpiration: loss of excess water as water vapor from stomata of plants.

# Oxygen cycle
(1.25 PM)
- it's linked to carbon cycle.
- Photosystthis releases oxygen which is used up in respiration.
- Formation of [[stratosphere]]ric [[ozone]] in [[atmosphere]](25-30 km): [[oxygen]] breaks in presence of UV rays to give ozone.
- Oxygen is found in minerals such as sulfate, phosphate, etc.
- Oxygen is found in ores like hematite, [[bauxite]], silica, calcite, etc, found in earth's crust.
# sedimentary cycle
## Phosphorus cycle
(1.33 PM)
- it's an [[important]] element for living organisms.
- it's found in bones & teeth of [[animal]].
- it's also found in nucleic acids like DNA & RNA.
- Unlike carbon cycle & nitrogen cycle atmospheric component is lacking in phosphorus cycle.
	- ie it's only a land-sea cycle
- reserve pool of phosphorus cycle in [[earth]]'s [[crust]].
- Phosphorus from rocks becomes part of [[soil]] through [[weathering]].
- From soil, it's taken up by plants which convert it into organic matter.
- plants are then eaten by animals.
- When animal dies bacteria decomposes animals to release phosphorus back, which leads to creation of rocks.
- tectonic upliftment brings rocks back on surface & thus cycle continues.
- use of chemical fertilizers such as ammonium phosphate in agriculture adds phosphorus to soil.
- Phosphate found in [[soil]] through agricultural run-off reaches oceans & marine bodies.
- This is taken up by marine organisms. 
- Then death of marine organic leads to sedimentation which further leads to mineralization.
- Then it enters into earth's crusts thus carrying cycle forward.
- Guano deposits (bird dropping) contain phosphorus. guano deposits are found in Ecuador in [[south ç¾Žå›½ tk]]. _related_ [[coprolite]]

## Sulfur cycle
(2.00 PM)

Sulfur is found in living organisms in form of proteins(cysteine amino-acid).
Enzymes also contain sulfur.
Sulfur is found in rocks like ores(Pyrite ores, etc).
through weathering, sulfur enters soil.
This sulfur is absorbed by plants.
these plants are eaten by animals.
Then animal dies & Sulfur breaking bacteria release Sulfur back to soil.
sulfur is also released by bacterial action into atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide gas.
Through mineralization, sulfur again becomes part of rocks & cycle continues.
Natural sources of sulfur: 
Volcanic eruption, hot geysers, sulfur springs, thermal vents, etc.
Anthropogenic sources:  
Release of SO2 by thermal power plants.
Use of hydrocarbons in vehicles, smelting, refinery, etc.
Burning of fuelwood for cooking.
SO2 & H2S gas reacts with rainwater & cause acid rain.
sulfur in soil reaches marine organisms through agricultural runoffs.
This sulfur is taken up by marine organisms & becomes part of marine food web.
When these marine organisms die, they are deposited on bottom of ocean as sediments.
Then through mineralization sulfur enters earth's crust.
process of rock formation follows & these rocks are brought back to surface, continuing cycle again.

# Biological diversity
(2.28 PM)

it's scientific study of variation found in all living organisms in all forms & complexities.
it's also a study of all differences found within species, äº†/äºº species, & äº†/äºº ecosystems.
Type of bio-diversity:
Genetic diversity:
it's studied at genetic level within species based on differences found in genes & DNA.
For example:
Leopard: Common leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard. 
Tiger: Royal Bengal tiger, Amur tiger(Siberia), Javan tiger, African tiger, Caspian tiger.
Lion: African lion(Savana grasslands), Asiatic lions(Gir).
Mango: alfanso, malda, langda, banganpalli etc. 
Species diversity:
Differences are found äº†/äºº various types of species.
For example Tiger, Lion, Leopard, etc.

# Ecosystem/community diversity:
it's differentdiå¯º types of species composition found äº†/äºº various types of ecological systems.
For example:
Tropical rainforest(amazon rainforest, western ghats) versus alpine forest.
Thar desert versus Sahara desert.

# Importance of biodiversity
(2.52 PM)

Biodiversity values:
Food, medicines, timber, etc.
Ecological values: Food web, Nutrient cycling, etc.
Aesthetic & recreational values: literature & eco-tourism.
Spiritual, Religious, cultural, & traditional values like beliefs, faiths, etc.
Knowledge values: scientific knowledge we drive from nature.
Ethical value: to protect environment for example Chipko movement.
Ecosystem services:
Provisional services: food, water, forest produce, oxygen, etc.
Regulating services: cycling of wastes, climate moderation, control of flood, etc.
Supporting services: providing habitat to living organisms, nutrient cycle, etc.
Cultural services: festivals like Bihu, Pongal, Onam, etc.
These ecosystem services are based on finding of millennium ecosystem assessment(MEB) report.

# economics of ecosystem & biodiversity(TEEB)
(3.27 PM)

TEEB concept was brought up by Pawan Sukhdev in 2007.
aim of TEEB is monetary valuation of ecosystem service & biodiversity values in terms of "green domestic product"(natural capital).
it's a quantitative tool to capture, evaluate & demonstrate ecosystem services & biodiversity values in monetary terms for decision making.
it's also a method of green accounting. 
TEEB was initiated by G-8, in developing countries like India, China, South Africa, Brazil, etc in Potsdam in 2008.
it's hosted by UNEP.

# Biodiversity loss
(3.44 PM)

Habitat loss:
Mining, deforestation, infrastructure projects, etc.
Invasive alien species: introduced in agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, by humans or other species that migrate naturally.
Climate change: 
Polar bears(melting of arctic ice).
Croal reef belching(great barrier reef).
Effect on migratory species.
Envirmonertal pollution:
Acid rain affecting forest ecosystem & water bodies.
River pollution affecting dolphins etc.
Genetic pollution:
Uncontrolled hybridization(interbreeding & cross-breeding).
GM varieties of crops for example BT- cotton.
Over-exploitation of genetic resources:
Illegal hunting & poaching of wildlife & killing of animals etc.

# Biodiversity conservation
(4.04 PM)

In-situ conservation:
it's conservation within natural habitat of wild animals & plants.
For example various types of sanctuaries, various types of national parks, biosphere reserves, community reserves, conservation reserves, protected forests, reserved forests.
Ex-situ conservation:
it's conservation of species outside natural habitat.
Conservation of plants: herbarium, botanical gardens, seed banks(cryo-preservation) like Svalbard in Norway & Changla bank in Ladakh.
Conservation of animals: captive breeding center, zoological park, DNA banks(LACONS in Hyderabad, IVRI lab in Bareilly).

topic for next class: national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.
