yeasts represent a very diverse group of microorganisms, & even strains that are classified as same species often show a high level of genetic divergence.
yeasts biodiversity is closely related to their applicability.
biotechnological importance of yeast is almost immeasurable.
yeasts have a wide range of applications mainly in food industry (winemaking, brewing, distilled spirits production, & baking) & in biomass production (single-cell protein scp).
more recently, yeast has also been used in biofuel industry & for production of heterologous compounds.
obviously, their main application arises from metabolic capacity to carry out transformation of sugars into ethyl alcohol & carbon dioxide under anaerobic conditions.
moreover, a large number of secondary flavor compounds are created which implies organoleptic attributes of particular food products.
however, it would be misguided to trivialize their metabolic capacities only to fermentative activity.
main factors influencing yeast metabolism are oxygen availability & type of carbon source.
in food industry, saccharomyces cerevisiae is genus of yeast most frequently used, whereas candida,
endomycopsis, & kluyveromyces are crucial for SCP production.
