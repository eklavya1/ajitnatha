10. PS1793 它 fixed د LR permanently

12. post-1892 د disappointment 的 ica 1892 led to change 的 demand من limit[[polity|e]]d self-政府 to self-政府 like [[Canada dd]], [[australia]] ----- there ain theory
# indian council (amendment) [[acts 行为]] 1892 (lord cross act)
1. viceroy - lansdowne 8894
2. 第一 time a grain/element introduced - ie indirect elections 里 lc (ilc+plc)
3. ILc 过 expanded 被 有 few 更 members (1861- 6-12 更 members 和 half must be non-officials)
4. 10 -16 members 能 non-officials
5. some non-officials members were to be supposedly indirectly elected
6. grievance \ criticism- 它 过 selection 和 不 election
7. local bodies- municipalities, district boards, chambers 的 commerce, universities . They would send a list 中 themselves 和 from this [[viceroy]] would select some as off members , 所以 不 有1的 的 % control
8. 力 的 lc-
		1. bills 和 resolution是 (expresses will\ sense\ opinion 的 د legislative body)
		2. opposition 不 有 力 to bring 只 resolution + opposition could also 不 demand a vote on a resolution brough to lc 被 د 政府
		3. 所以 policies 的 政府 could 从不 be challenged
		4. 政府 was 给 力 to legislative even wout referring to د legislature 和 所以 lc 的 functions were at best recommendatory 和 不 mandatory

# weakness 的 moderates
- inc was 不 a truly representative org 为 印度 人  _related_ [[newsroom series#^b11acd]] | [[]] | [[]] 
- there was 全 exclusion 的 non-elites
- 西 educated professionals dominated they came من middle class, 所以 poorer not represented 
		- lawyers
		- laoshi
		- doctors
		- traders
		- [[bankers]]
		- writers
		- men 的 press
- region based eliteness
- certain members came من 三 presidencies while 其他 的 regions were under-represented
- within presidencies [[bombay]] accounted 为 half 的 د members
- low bengali members cause 的 parallel associations [[1876]] 的 的 [[surendranath bannerjea tk]]
- until 1905, 高 caste hindus dominated [[indian national congress]], 所以 [[muslim]]s 也 不 there
# impact
1.  د claim 的 being representative 的 都 印度 人
2.  effectiveness 的 [[indian national congress]] programmes their demands was diluted
3.  commitment
		1.  最多 were 只 part time politicians 和 有 lucrative legal practice
		2.  there was 不 organizational 气度 的 [[indian national congress]] on د ground 和 它 was 更 的 an annual conference 的 三 days than a political party
		3.  limited goal 的 self 政府 ie they did 不 even aspire 为 self 政府 under british rule 和 只 要 to remove undesirable aspects 的 [[british]] rule, surendranath bannerjea 说 - "我们 要 remove د unbritish rule 和 不 brit rule"
		4.  د 第一 [[president]] 说- "[[indian national congress]] 是 loyal to 和 a well wisher 的 british", 他们 believed 里 د benevolence 的 brit rule, 那 印度 人 不 是 ready 为 self 政府
4.   methods
		1.   sending prayers 和 petitions (formal request ) + articles 里 د newspaper📰 + passing resolution (expression 的 opinion) 但 不 action on streets to implement د party program
		2.   只 mind, 但 不 body (不 executive capacity 才能)
		3.   所以 د extremists criticized above as strategy 的 [[mendicancy]], however 他们 不 有 其他 的 choice, since brits would 有 banned [[indian national congress]] 和 他们 couldnt 有 done anything cause 文化 的 mass action had not developed
5. criticism 
		1. tool up pro-[[zamindar]] stand 和 不 pro-peasant stand, this was cause 的 their elite background 比如 - opposed [[bengal]] tennacy 行为 1885, pro-extension 的 ps [[1793]]
		2. took pro-moneylenders stand, opposed [[punjab]] 土地 alienation bill 的 1899 which sought to protect 土地 ownership 里 case 的 default 被 peasants on loans taken
		3. they did 不 take up pro-working stand where 印度 capitalists were involved 比如 - opposed factory reforms 哪 provide minimum age 的 work 和 would have prevented child labor (wages, safety at work, etc)
		4. took up stand that only 印度 [[capitalism 资本主义]] 能 end poverty, 所以  那 reflected their pro-capitalist 里 ideology
# moderates initiated project 的 nation building
1. 他们 bridged د regional differences 和 brought د regional leaders 一起 
		1. [[1885]] [[indian national congress]] session - inc adopted goal 的 [[development]] 和 consolidation 的 national 统一 
		2. [[indian national congress]] sessions were held at diff regions each 年 + pres 的 that session was 不 to be من 那 region, 那 帮 里 breaking regional barriers + 帮 里 development 的 common viewpoints 中 regional leaders who were now 更 aware 的 issues 的 其他 的 regions, 所以 an 都 印度 leadership was 里 د making 被 [[indian national congress]]
		3. [[1888]] resolution 那 不 resolution would be passed if an overwhelming majority 多数 的 [[hindu]] 或 muslim representative 的 [[indian national congress]] 是 opposed to 那 resolution
		4. [[1889]] [[indian national congress]] resolution on [[expansion]] 的 lc had a minority clause 哪 stated 那 wherever hindus, muslims, christians [[christianity 🕇 ✠]] , parsis, [[sikhs ☬]] 是 里 minority, there seats 里 lc should  be reserved 里 proportion 的 % 的 minority (少数民族) community 里 人口 (minority % 的 reserved seats= % 的 人口  的 minority)
		5. sessions 的 inc were held like sessions 的 parliament ie 民主 functioning was ther 知道, 所以 开 was harbinger 的 modern politics 和 也 took up د project 的 indian nation 里 د making
		6. drain theory 或 经济 economic critique was major/main contribution 的 moderates 
# drain theory 被 moderates
- developed 被 ==rc dutt== (比如 -ics)
- ==他 xie 书 - "经济 历史  的 印度 " ==[[1901]] #pre 
- [[dadabhai naraoji]]- later 变得 memb 的 parliament
- [[mg ranade]] `post-dated` -07:10 PM 11/9/2021
- this eroded د moral authority 的 د british rule ie moderates proved 那 brit rule 是 为 [[_economics 经济 MOC]] exploitation 的 印度 + 他们 intellectually defeated د case 为 benevolence 的 br rule (post 1892)
-  他们 proved 那 britishers converted 印度 from exporters 的 finished goods like cotton cloth to importer 的 finished goods 和 exporter 的 raw material, 印度 不 get fair price even 为 د raw material exports 和 further earned 被 converting 印度 to an export market
-  home charges- expenses 的 印度 officials 里 london were paid 为 被 印度
-  salaries 的 a costly bureaucracy 因为 的 lack 的 印度nization 的 services
-  military expenditure 的 british 印度 军 
-  FDI (外 direct investment)
		-  ROI (ret on invst) went outta 印度 
		-   د 外 商业 人 benefitted from so called industrialization/[[development]] 的 印度 via rail-路 和 canal construction
		-   guaranteed interests on FDI 里 railways
		-   guarantee interests on FDI 里 railways - there was a clause 哪 provided 为 5% ROI, if د brit 商业 decided to pull out a railway project 的 99 年 的 lease, 这 meant 那 even if د project was 不 给 a ROI د brit 商业 would still gain 5% assured returns, 这 led to drain 的 财富 + construction 的 railway lines wout 商业 sense
		-   absence 的 protective tariffs to protect 或 safeguard indigenous industry
		-   exchange (交换) rates were such 这 brit exp benefitted 和 imports costed less
# rise 的 extremist leaders 里 inc
- failure 的 moderates to extract 只 concession من british 给 way 为 to rise 的 extremist leaders within [[indian national congress]]
- cultural [[nationalism]] 里 form 的 印度 revivalism was 给 a political turn 被 extremists leaders, د utility was 那 orthodoxy 里 religion was popular 中 人
- curzonian administration - raised د anger 中 印度 人 哪 帮 里 strengthening د extremist leaders
- religion 里 [[Indian National movement]] (early nationalism)  - giving political shape to cultural [[nationalism]] 
		- 里 1890s, there was rise 的 文化  [[nationalism]] 里 form 的 印度 revivalism
		- religion 变得 imp tool 为 organizing, mobilizing 人 , 因为 它 是 emotional issue 和 它 brought out د lazy 人 on to د streets
		- [[events]]- 
				- rukha bai case  (1884-88)
				- death 的 phulmoni (11 年 [[girl]], 因为  sexual abuse)
				- 岁 的 consent bill 的 [[1891]]
				- here bal gangadhar tilak 和 poona sarvajanik sabha took orthodox stand (anti reform stand), 他 用  他  的 [[newspaper]] ie kesari #pre (里 marathi) 和 maharatta (里 english)
				- 里 [[1890]] , 有 cow protection movement where [[bal gangadhar tilak]] formed gau rakshak sabhas 所以 poltically recruited cow into [[Indian National movement]], 因为 的 allegation 的 brits being pro-muslim, during cow riots 的 [[1893]]
				- political recruitment 的 god ganpati 和 shiva (1893,1892) 被 [[bal gangadhar tilak]]
				- ganpati pooja was a personal affair, until tilak 里 1893 开 ganpati festivals where 大 gatherings took place, nationalistic songs were sungs 被 100s 的 singers, tilak asked hindus to avoid moharrams 和 attend ganpati festivals ---->被 1905 this festival was  celebrated 都 across [[maharashtra]], vir savarkar used to write nationalistic songs 为 د festival
						- [[shivaji]] festival ([[1896]]) = to celebrate coronation 的 shivaji as chatrapati , who upheld self respect 的 hindus
						- event 的 killing 的 plague commissioner rand 里 1897 被 chapekar brothers #pre 
				- 1896- 有 famine 里 [[maharashtra]]+1897 plague 里 poona
				- rand 变得 unpopular , 他 用 harsh methods to force 人 into hospitals 
				- tilak organized famine 和 plague relief
				- tilak made a speech where 他 valorized [[shivaji]] 为 killing afzal khan 里 1659 + poem "shivaji utterances" #pre was published 里 kesari, after 这 chapekar bros killed rand 里 1897, tilak was imprisoned 为 18 months, he famously then 说 - "[[swaraj]] 是 wo 的 生right 和 I shall 有 它 ", tilak had nowhere directly 给 a call for killing 的 rand
				- tilak played an imp role 和 his festivals 变得 imp tools 为 spread 的 nationalistic ideas
				- 所以 religion was always a part 的 印度 nationalism since د early phase
				- his negative (消极) point was alienation 的 muslims 和 lower caste hindus, 因为 这 过 د upper caste leaders who were 里 charge
				- post 1893 riots 和 a soft stand 的 moderates led to near zero participation 的 muslims 里 [[indian national congress]]
				- `消极 - seeds 的 communalism were sown side-by-side 的 seeds 的 nationalism`
