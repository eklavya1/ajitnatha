Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended the interim ways and means advances (WMAs) limit to state governments to help them tide over the financial stress posed by the second wave of COVID-19.
Under the RBI Act, 1934, WMAs are the temporary advances given by the RBI to centers and States to tide over any mismatch in receipts and payments. Borrowings through WMA are to be repaid within three months and usually offered at the repo rate.
There are two types of WMAs — normal Ways and Means Advances; and Special Drawing Facilities (SDF) against [[government]] securities held by States as collateral.
Any amount drawn by a [[State]] more than the normal WMA is an overdraft.
There is a State-wise limit for the funds that can be availed via WMA.
These limits depend on many factors, including total expenditure, revenue deficit, and fiscal position of the State.
WMA limits are revised periodically and the previous utilization rates are considered while determining revised limits.
The rate of interest applicable for normal WMA funding from RBI is the repo rate.
The govemments are, however, allowed to draw amounts above their WMA limits.
The interest on such overdraft is 2 percentage points above the repo rate.
The interest levied for special WMAs or Special Drawing Facility (SDF) is one percentage point less than the repo rate due to the backing of government securities. After the state has exhausted the limit of SDF, it gets normal WMA.
