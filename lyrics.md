https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ojniol06iY
Honey got a sexy all steamin
She givin hotness a new meanin
Perfection mama you gleamin
Inception you got a brother
dreamin dreamin
Damn baby I'm feignin
I'm trynna holler at you, I'm screamin
Let me love you down this
evenin
**Love you love you ya you know
you are my demon**
Girl we could form a team and
I could be the king you could be
the queen and
My mind's dirty and it don't
need cleanin

I love you long time so you
know the meanin
Oh baby I can't come down so
please come help me out
You got me feelin high and I
can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
