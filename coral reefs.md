- deep-sea corals are defined as corals that live at depths greater than 50 meters, but most species live in depths several hundred meters deep, in cold, dark, rocky habitats, often far from shore- unlike shallow-water coral reefs, which are limited to warm tropical waters, deep-sea corals are found throughout world's oceans, from tropical to polar regions. 
- like their shallow counterparts, deep-sea reefs are created by stony corals that form large geological structures over thousands of years-
- while diversity of corals that build reefs in shallow waters is very high & includes hundreds of species, there are only 6 species of deep-sea stony corals tlat create reefs. hence, statement 2 is incorrect
- shallow-water corals rely on photosynthetic algae that live within corals & provide their hosts witl nutrition.
- however, algae cannot survive where there is no light, so deep-sea corals need to rely on alternate sources of food to obtain their nutrition, either by feeding on organic material falling from surface or by feeding on small plankton.

- coral reefs are built by & made up of thousands of tiny animals—coral "polyps"—that are related to anemones & jellyfish.
- polyps are shallow-water organisms that have a soft body covered by a calcareous skeleton.
- polyps extract calcium salts from seawater to form these hard skeletons.
- polyps live in colonies fastened to rocky seafloor.
- tubular skeletons grow upwards & outwards as a cemented calcareous rocky mass collectively c/a corals.
- when coral polyps die, they shed their skeleton [coral] on which new polyps grow.
- cycle is repeated for millions of years leading to accumulation of layers of corals [shallow rock created by these depositions is c/a reef].
- these layers at diff stages give rise to various marine landforms. 1 such important landform is c/a a coral reef.
- coral reefs over a period of time transform or evolve into coral islands (lakshadweep).
- corals occur in diff forms & colors, depending upon nature of salts or constituents they are made of.
- small marine plants (algae) also deposit calcium carbonate contributing to coral growth.
