Science and Technology ( ABH ) Class 12

A brief overview of the previous class

Aditya L1 Mission (1:25:00 PM)

Aditya means ‘Sun’, the first solar mission of ISRO.
L1: Lagrange Point 1 and Halo orbits. 
James Webb Telescope has been launched at L2 Point.
Aditya L1: India’s first dedicated scientific mission was to study the sun, around the Lagrangian point L1.
It has the following objectives: 
It will provide observation for Sun chromosphere, photosphere, and outer corona, in different frequency bands.
It will study the particle flux emanating from the sun, and reaching the L1 orbit.
It will also measure the variation in magnetic field strength at the halo orbit.
It will study the origin of solar storms and their path through the interplanetary space from the sun to the earth.
Corona is an aurora of plasma that surrounds the sun and other stars, it extends millions so kilometres into space and is most easily seen during the total solar eclipse.
Lagrangian points are 5 special points where the combined gravitational forces of two larger bodies provide the necessary centripetal force for a third smaller body to complete its orbit. 
Such orbits are called halo orbits.
The L1 point has a major advantage of continuously viewing the sun without any interference. 
L1 is about 1.5 million kilometres from earth towards the sun.
The L2 point is ideal for astronomy. Which is also about 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth, away from the sun.

Launch Vehicles (2:41:00 PM):

These are used to carry manned or unmanned missions to space.
They have the following major components: 
Engine
Control and command systems.
Payload box.
Rocket fuel, propellant. 
Solid fuel: HTPB, hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene, the solid fuel can easily be stored and transported, and they are safer and cheaper.
However, they are less efficient than liquid fuel, and once the fuel is ignited resulting thrust cannot be regulated or turned off.
Liquid Fuel: UDMH: Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and N2O4, also Monomethyl hydrazine+MoH (mix of Nitrogen oxides).
In liquid fuel, the fuel flow to the engine can be controlled, the energy density of liquid fuel is high.
However, they are very expensive and require proper maintenance because of difficulty in storage and transportation.
Launch vehicles often use a combination of different rocket engines and fuel.

Launch vehicles of ISRO: (3:09:00 PM)

Past: SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle), Augmented SLV.
Present: PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle).
PSLV has a payload capacity of 1750 kg.
GSLV (Mark-2 and 3)
GSLV MK-2 has a payload capacity of 5000kg for Low Earth Orbit and 2500 kg for GTO.
GSLV Mk3 was used to launch the Chandryaan-2. 
SSLV: Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) of ISRO, is a small-lift launch vehicle.
Future: Reusable Launch Vehicle, Scramjet.

Space Debris: (3:28:00 PM)

Due to various rocket launchers, destroying the rockets, anti-satellite tests, etc. has created a huge amount of debris in space.
Some of the smaller ones are not dangerous (they are of the size of sand).

Remove Debris Mission: 

Led by the Surrey Space Centre from the University of Surrey.
Net capture: It involves a net that will be deployed at the target.
Harpoon Capture: This will be launched at a target plate made of ‘representative satellite panel materials.’
Vision-based navigation: Using cameras and LIDAR, the platform will send data about debris back to the ground for processing.
De-orbiting process: As it enters the earth’s atmosphere, the spacecraft will burn up, leaving no debris behind.
