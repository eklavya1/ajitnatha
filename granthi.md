- A **granthi** (Punjabi: ਗ੍ਰੰਥੀ, IPA: [ˈɡɾəntʰi]) is a person, female or male, of the Sikh religion who is a *ceremonial reader of the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]*, which is the Holy Book in Sikhism, often read to worshipers at Sikh temples called a Gurdwara. The name Granthi comes from the Sanskrit granthika, which means a relater or narrator. Any Sikh individual appointed the title of being a Granthi is considered a principal religious official of Sikhism. Although they are considered religious officials in Sikhism, they are not considered to be the equivalent of a priest, as the belief is that there are no such religious intermediaries.
