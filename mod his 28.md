	1/3rd reservation in center legislature assembly.
	Reservation In Muslim majority provisions until there is a universal adult franchise.
	Residuary power with provinces.
	All these amendments were however rejected.

# INC Calcutta session 1928:
Nehru report adopted by INC.
If dominion status is not given in one year then the goal of the INC will be Poona swaraj and INC will launch the civil disobedience movement.
Resolution for constructive work was passed: anti-untouchability, swadeshi-education, khadi, Anti-liquor campaign, and removal of disabilities for women. but did not include Hindu-Muslim unity.

1/3rd seats in the Central legislature assembly.
Muslim majority provinces.
Reservation in Muslim majority provinces.
Residual power to provinces.
Provincial autonomy  (own budget for provinces)
Federal constitutions and not unitary in nature.
No change in the constitution without the consent of the state.

# Irwin statement 1929: Diwali declaration
 - #pre 
- After the Calcutta session of INC British wanted to placate Indian leaders.
- proposed round table conference and discussion of dominion status demand.
- The intent of the British is to give dominion status in the future.
- Dominion status implicit in the Montagu statement 1917:
- The policy of the British is to increase the participation of India in every branch of government.
- To gradually develop self-governing institutions.
- The longer-term goal of the British is responsible self-government within the British empire.
- For this British proposed round table conferences:
- 1st RTC: INC did not participate.
- 2nd RTC: INC participated after the Gandhi-Irwin pact.
- 3rd RTC: INC did not participate.
- The problem with Irwin's statement was that there was no timeline for dominion status.

## Impact of Irwin statement 1929:
Delhi manifesto 1929 by INC:
	Round table conference should act as constitutional assembly drafting a constitution for dominion of India instead of RTC  discussing there whether and when to given dominion status to India.
The majority of Indian representatives should be from INC.
Amnesty in Meerut conspiracy case and bomb in center legislature assembly case.

# Lahore session 1929 of INC
- Presided by Jawahar Lal Nehru and stated that now the goal of the Indian national congress will be Purna swaraj.
- 1st RTC was boycotted by INC as the Delhi manifesto was rejected by Irwin.
- The authority was given to Mahatma Gandhi to launch the civil disobedience movement. at the appropriate time.
- INC gave a coll for resigning from council immediately.
- IT was decided that 26 January 1930, will be celebrated as independence day by reading out an independence pledge.
- Some sections were not united in favor of the civil disobedience movement as:
	- The Depression of 1929 had impacted Indian trade and capitalists were unsure of the civil disobedience movement.
	- There was no Hindu-Muslim unity and the Muslim members of INC were unsure of launching a movement.
	- Muslim league called Civil Disobedience Movement a ploy of INC to established Hindu raj.
	- Communists opposed the Civil disobedience movement.

# Mahatma Gandhi gave 11 point demand to the British:
Reduce military expenditure.
Reduce civil servant's salaries.
Total prohibition.
Release prisoners not convicted of murder.
Reform CID and bring it under popular control.
Reduce exchange rate.
Protective tariff for cotton.
Reverse coastal tariff for Indian shipping industries.
50% reduction of land revenue.
Bringing land revenue rate under legislative control.
Abolish sat tax and government monopoly over salt.
The goal was to unite all classes and link independence to specific grievances.

# Civil disobedience movement
## Causes:
- Rejection of 11 point demand of Gandhiji by Irwin.
- The great depression 1929: the crash of the price of expert cash crops(cotton, jute). the price of wheat and rice also decreased thus the earning reduced but the land revenue remained the same.
- Moneylenders stopped lending but there was no change in demand for land revenue, this forced people to sell their land.
- 1927 : Capitalists formed the federation of the Indian chamber of commerce and industry (FICCI).
- 1928-29: Peak period of labor unrest due to rising communist influence.
## why focus on salt?
It won't lead to government repression as no impact government finances.
It will unite all especially the poor section of the society.
It will not alienate non-INC forces as served no vested interest.
2 stage plan by CWC:
## 1st stage:
Dandi march in march 1930:
from Sabarmati ashram to Dandi coast for breaking of salt law.
C Rajagopalchari marched from Tiruchirapalli to Vedaranniyam.
K.Kallanpan in Malabar cost from Calicit to Poyannur.
Andhra: camps of salt satyagraha.
Assam: Sylhet to Bengal.
Illegal manufacturing of salt and boycott of foreign cloth and liquor.
Lawyer and government servant to resign.
Boycott courts.
## 2nd stage:
Non-payment of revenue in Ryotwari areas. 
Non-payment of chowkidar tax in zamindari areas.
Violation of forest laws in central provinces.
the Dharsana satyagraha in Gujarat May 1930:  Gandhiji planned a raid on Dharsana salt works and got arrested. later the raid was led by Sarojini Naidu and Gandhiji's son Manilal. 
Assam protest: cunningham circular 1930-31 forced parents to give assurance of good behavior of their children.
## positives of CDM:
Initial violence did not lead to the immediate withdrawal of movement.
It was an all India movement. 
New massive capitalist support especially traders.
large scale women participation.
urban and rural areas were both impacted.
## Negatives of CDM:
No major worker participation as CPI boycotted the movement.
No Hindu-Muslim unity.
Middle-class youth not inspired by mild CDM
the movement was withdrawn due to rising radicalism and instances of violence.
the movement was withdrawn via the Gandhi-Irwin pact 1931.

# The Gandhi-Irwin pact 1931
1st RTC was a failure due to the absence of INC therefore British wanted reconciliation.
As part of the pact following decisions were made:
Civil Disobedience Movement to be suspended and INC to participate in 2nd RTC.
Release of political prisoners not charged with violence.
Government to cancel fine and return confiscated land.
Right to make salt for personal use.
Right to picket peacefully.
Withdrawal of emergency ordinances.
Rejected the commutation of the death sentence of Bhagat Singh. 

# Karachi session 1931 (special session)
Approved Gandhi-Irwin pact.
Fundamental right resolution.
National economic program.

# 2nd Round table conference:

talks failed due to the following issues:
the separate electorate for the minorities not just the Muslims but also the depressed class.
the government refused to accept the demand of the Purna swaraj.
the Gandhiji resumed the CDM.

# 2nd phase of civil disobedience movement

The government banned the INC in 1932 and Gandhiji was arrested.
Low response of people in 2nd phase as they felt betrayed by the withdrawal of the first phase.

# Communal award 1932

the separate electorate for depressed classes.
congress neither rejected it nor accepted it.
Gandhiji said that this will make untouchability permanent.

# Poona Pact: 
Between Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar after Gandhiji started fast unto death.
communal ward was rejected.
increase in reservation for depressed classes from 71 to 147 seats in the provincial legislative assembly.
18% reservation for depressed classes in the central legislative assembly.

# Government of India act of 1935
Dyarchy at the center and provincial autonomy.
Divided powers between the center and the provinces(Federal List, Provincial List, Concurrent List).
Provided for the federal structure that is India to be a union of British India and princely states.
But this will come into operation only when at least half of the princely sated agrees to join the union of India by signing the instrumented of accession.
Provisions related to the center were never implemented.
Bicameral legislature(lower house and council of states)
30-40% could be the nominees of princes.
Life of council of state to be permanent with 1/3rd member retiring every year.
Federal assembly to have a life of 5 years.
Direct election to the council of states and indirect election to the federal assembly.
The Viceroy was vested with residual powers.

The topic for the next class: the freedom struggle to continue.
