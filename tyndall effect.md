- • The Tyndall effect is light scattering by particles in a colloid or in a very fine suspension. Because of the small size of colloidal particles, we cannot see them with naked eyes. But, these particles can easily scatter a beam of visible light. This scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect after the name of the scientist who discovered this effect.
 - • Tyndall effect can also be observed when a fine beam of light enters a room through a small hole. This happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of water, dust, and smoke in the air.
 - • Tyndall effect can be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets of water, which act as particles of colloid dispersed in the air.
 - • Tyndall effect can be seen in shining a beam of a flashlight into the glass of milk. Hence option 2 is correct.
 - • Another example of the Tyndall effect is the blue-colored iris. The translucent layer over the iris causes the scattering of the blue light making the eyes looks blue.
 - • Dispersion of light refers to the splitting of light into various components namely Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red (VIBGYOR).
