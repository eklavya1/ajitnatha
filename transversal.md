- A line that intersects two or more lines at distinct points is called a transversal.

- In mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, given a family of sets, here called a collection C, a **transversal** (also called a cross-section) is a set containing exactly one element from each member of the collection. When the sets of the collection are mutually disjoint, each element of the transversal corresponds to exactly one member of C (the set it is a member of).  If the original sets are not disjoint, there are two possibilities for the definition of a transversal:
- One variation is that there is a bijection f from the transversal to C such that x is an element of f(x) for each x in the transversal.  In this case, the transversal is also called a system of distinct representatives (SDR).: 29 
- The other, less commonly used, does not require a one-to-one relation between the elements of the transversal and the sets of C. In this situation, the members of the system of representatives are not necessarily distinct.: 692 : 322 In computer science, computing transversals is useful in several application domains, with the input family of sets often being described as a hypergraph.
