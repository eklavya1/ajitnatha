	- normal conditions
		- near [[south 美国]] coast, [[wind]]s blow offshore & blows the surface water away from the [[continents]]. To replace this water, cool bottom water upwells
		- [[air]] above this cool water ☵ is stabilised & convection is suppressed
		- the water flows westward as southe[[trade|ast t]]rade [[geo 22|winds]] blow towards western pacific region
		- it is heated & rises, flows eastward in the upper [[troposphere]] & descends down along eastern pacific [[ocean]] to complete the circulation
		- this causes high [[pressure]] & low [[temperate climate]] in eastern [[pacific 海洋]] &
		- low press & high temp in western pacific [[ocean]].
		- the resulting convective cell is called as walker circulation. in this normal condition, eastern pacific coast experiences [[draught]] with western pacific having good rainfall
