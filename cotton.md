Cotton is one of India's most important fibre and cash crops and plays a dominant role in the industrial and agricultural economy of the country.
It provides the basic raw material (cotton fibre) to the cotton textile industry.
There are four cultivated species of cotton viz. Gossypium arboreum, G.herbaceum, G.hirsutum and G.barbadense.
The Ministry of Textiles has launched the 1st ever brand and logo for Indian Cotton on 2nd World Cotton Day.
India's premium Cotton would be known as 'Kasturi Cotton' in the world cotton trade.
The branding, Kasturi Cotton, would initially be applied to long-staple cotton that is grown in India and meets prescribed standards.
The Kasturi Cotton brand represents whiteness, brightness, softness, purity, uniqueness and Indianness. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
India is the largest cotton producer and the largest consumer of cotton in the world. Hence, statement I is not correct.
