- Daylight Saving Time, also called summer time, is a `system for uniformly advancing clocks,` so as to extend daylight hours during conventional waking time in the summer months.
- The reason for daylight saving time has long been to save energy. The time change was first instituted in the United States during [[world war 1]]. Even during the [[Arab oil embargo]], when Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) stopped selling petroleum to the United States, it even enacted a trial period of year-round daylight saving time in an attempt to save energy #doubt . But the evidence for energy savings is slim.
- Regions farthest away from the equator and closer to the poles get the most benefit from the DST clock change, because there is a more dramatic change in sunlight throughout the seasons. DST is generally not observed near the [[equator]], where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it.
