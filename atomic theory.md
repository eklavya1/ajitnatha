around 500 bc, indian philosopher maharishi kanad, 1st time postulated concept of indivisible part of
matter & named it 'pramanu.'
in 1808, john dalton used term 'atom' & postulated atomic theory to study of matter.
salient features of dalton's atomic theory
ion
all matter is made of very minuscule particles k/a atoms.
atom is indivisible particle, which cannot be created or destroyed through a chemical reaction.
hence statement 1 is incorrect.
all atoms of element are identical in mass & chemical properties whereas, atoms of diff elements
have diff masses & chemical properties.
to form a compound, atoms are combined in ratio of small whole numbers.
in a given compound, relative number & kinds of atoms are constant.
a charged particle is k/a ion; it could be either a negative charge or a positive charge.
o positively charged ion is k/a a 'cation'. hence statement 2 is incorrect.
negatively charged ion is k/a 'anion.'
molecular mass
o molecular mass of a substance is calculated by taking sum of atomic masses of all the
atoms in a molecule of a respective substance. hence statement 3 is correct.
law of conservation of mass
o during a chemical reaction, sum of masses of reactants & products remains unchanged, which
is k/a 'law of conservation of mass.' hence statement 4 is incorrect.
