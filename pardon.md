Pardon means absolving a person completely of the crime and letting him go free.
It amounts to turning the clock back. `sands of time` [[prince of persia]]
It completely absolves the convict from all the sentences, punishments, and disqualification.
The conviction and punishment will be done away with.
This power is to be exercised in very special circumstances only.
Only when a person has exhausted all the judicial remedies. but this is not an appeal against the order of the court.
