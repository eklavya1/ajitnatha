The Satavahanas ruled over parts of western India and the Deccan (c. second-century BCE-second century CE).
They were the first Deccanese dynasty to build an empire in daksinapatha—i.e., the southern region.
At the height of their power, the Satavahanas held distant areas of western and central India.
Their capital cities varied at different times. Pratishthana (Paithan) and Amaravati were their capitals.
Simuka was the founder of the Satavahana Dynasty.
Satavahana power was revived by Gautamiputra Shatakami (reigned c. 106—130 CE), the greatest ruler of the family.
o His conquests ranged over a vast territorial expanse stretching from Rajasthan in the northwest to Andhra in the southeast and from Gujarat in the west to Kalinga in the east.
The Nasik and Nanaghad inscriptions provide insights into the reign of Gautamiputra Shatakami. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.
Yajna Sri Satakarni (c. 152-181 CE.), also known as Gautamiputra Yajna Sri, was an Indian ruler of the Satavahana dynasty.
o He was the brother of Vashishtiputra Satakarni.
o He is considered to be the last great king of the Satavahana dynasty.
o He regained some of the territory lost to Shakas under Vashishtiputra Satakami.
o He defeated the Western Satraps and reconquered their southem regions in western and central India.
The Satavahana started to decline after Yajna Sri Satakarni, while the Western Satraps would continue to prosper for another two centuries.

Important features of the Satavahana dynsaty -
They issued mostly coins of lead, which is prevalent in the Deccan.
• They also issued potin, copper and bronze money.
• These coins were also helpful in knowing the economic conditions of that period.
• The Satavahanas were the first native Indian kings to have issued their own coins which had the rulers' portraits on them.
• Gautamiputra Satakarni started this practice which he imbibed from the Western Satraps after vanquishing them.
They are considered the first rulers to make land grants to the Brahmanas.
o Satavahana kings started the tradition of making tax-free land grants to Buddhists and Brahmanas to gain religious merit. This practice became more prominent in succeeding periods.
o In the Satavahana phase, many temples and monasteries were cut out of the solid rock in the north-westem Deccan or Maharashtra with great skill and patience.
The two common structures were the temple which was called chaitya and the monastery which was called the vihara.

• Satavahanas show traces of a matrilineal social structure.
