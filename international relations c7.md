india’s engagement with afghanistan prior to recent taliban takeover (03:23 pm)

india-afghanistan shares close cultural & political ties.
india was 1st non-communist country to recognize communist govt in afghanistan
despite its apprehensions, india recognized mujahideen govt
following 9/11 & usa-led war in afghanistan that deposed taliban from kabul in 2001, relations b/w india & afghanistan have only grown stronger.
afghanistan chose india to be 1st country to sign a strategic partnership agreement in 2011 despite usa & pakistan is willing to do so.
since 2001 nature of india’s engagement with afghanistan has been limited to state-building efforts.
reasons –
to assuage pak’s concern with respect to india in afghanistan.
usa chose pakistan as it’s a non-nato major ally in its global war against terror for geographical access (long durand line) & logistic purpose.

evidence of india’s engagement (03:34 pm)
evidence of india’s engagement (03:34 pm)

so far india has invested 3.5 billion dollars in economic aid to afghanistan apart from 1 billion dollars of bilateral trade that india has with country.

india’s state-building efforts, contribution to afghans economic development which covers a large part of country have won india large goodwill among afghan people.

evidence of india being at margin of international diplomacy on afghanistan (03:51 pm)
evidence of india being at margin of international diplomacy on afghanistan (03:51 pm)

india has been excluded from afghan peace processes. india was conspicuous by its absence in 6+2+1 meeting held in un secretariat.
this meeting was held regarding regional efforts to support peace in afghanistan.
it included 6 neighbouring countries of afghanistan namely iran, china, pakistan, tajikistan, turkmenistan, & uzbekistan; 2 global players namely usa & russia, & 1 in afghanistan itself.
growing normalization of countries with taliban regime – russia & iran maintained their embassies in kabul, turkmenistan send a ministerial delegation to discuss connectivity with taliban, uzbekistan accorded visiting deputy pm of taliban full protocol & discussed important matters with him is indicative of growing global recognition of taliban regime.
global powers be it usa which has led a bilateral discussion, russia which opened moscow process (india didn’t participate in 1st moscow process but was unofficially represented in 2nd moscow process).
troika+ engagement – usa, russia, china, & pakistan
failure of govt of india to directly engage with india. for a long india didn’t recognize taliban & insisted on afghan-owned & afghan-controlled process of a bilateral negotiation b/w afghanistan & taliban. india in fact failed to engage with taliban even when taliban indicated its intention to engage with india (taliban after abrogation of article 370, taliban distanced itself from pakistan’s criticism of india)

topic for next class – continuation of india-afghan relations.
