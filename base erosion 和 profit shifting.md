- Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to corporate tax planning strategies used by multinationals to "shift" profits from higher-tax jurisdictions to lower-tax jurisdictions, thus "eroding" the "tax-base" of the higher-tax jurisdictions.[5][6] The [[Organisation]] for Economic Co-operation and [[Development]] ([[OECD]]) define BEPS strategies as "exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules".
