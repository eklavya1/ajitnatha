- prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. temperate grassland regions include the pampas of argentina, brazil and uruguay, and the steppe of ukraine, russia and kazakhstan. lands typically referred to as "prairie" tend to be in north america. the term encompasses the area referred to as the interior lowlands of canada, the united states, and mexico, which includes all of the great plains as well as the wetter, hillier land to the east.

in the u.s., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of north dakota, south dakota, nebraska, kansas, and oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of montana, wyoming, colorado, new mexico, texas, missouri, iowa, illinois, indiana, wisconsin, and western and southern minnesota. the palouse of washington and the central valley of california are also prairies. the canadian prairies occupy vast areas of manitoba, saskatchewan, and alberta. prairies contain various lush flora and fauna, often contain rich soil maintained by biodiversity, with a temperate climate and a varied view.
