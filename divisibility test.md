## by 2
- if last digit - even, then the number is divisible
## by 3
- if sum of digits is divisible by 3 = then the number is divisible
## by 4
- if last 2 digits - multiple of 4, then the number is divisible
## by 5
- if last digit - 0 or 5, then the number is divisible
## by 6
- if the no. is divisible by 2 & 3, then its also divisible by 6 !!
- check divisibility for 2 & 3, voil√† !
## by 7
## by 8
## by 9
- just like divisibility of 3, add all numbers and see if its divisible by 9 if yes then its divisible otherwise not
