- in military terminology, a missile is a guided airborne ranged weapon capable of self-propelled flight usually by a jet engine or rocket motor. missiles are thus also called guided missiles or guided rockets (when in rocket form). missiles have five system components: targeting, guidance system, flight system, engine and warhead.  missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles (ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, anti-tank, etc.), surface-to-air missiles (and anti-ballistic), air-to-air missiles, and anti-satellite weapons.

airborne explosive devices without propulsion are referred to as shells if fired by an artillery piece and bombs if dropped by an aircraft. unguided jet- or rocket-propelled weapons are usually described as rocket artillery.

historically, the word missile referred to any projectile that is thrown, shot or propelled towards a target; this usage is still recognized today.
