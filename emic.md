- In anthropology, folkloristics, and the social and behavioral sciences, **emic** () and etic () refer to two kinds of field research done and viewpoints obtained:
- *emic, from within the social group* (from the perspective of the subject)
- and *[[etic]], from outside* (from the perspective of the observer).
