1. no five-year plan was implemented during this period due to *political instability*.
2. only annual plans were made for the period between [[1990]] and [[1992]].
3. in [[1991]], india faced a crisis in foreign exchange (forex) reserves, left with reserves of only about US $1 billion. at that time dr. [[manmohan singh]] launched india's free-market reforms that brought the nearly bankrupt nation back from the edge. it was the beginning of [[privatization]] and [[liberalization]] in india.
