The State of Hyderabad was founded by Qamar-ud-din Siddiqi, who was appointed Viceroy of the Deccan, with the title of Nizam-ul- Mulk, by Emperor Farrukhsiyar in 1712.
He established a virtually independent state but returned to Delhi during the reign of Emperor Mohammad Shah.
In [[1724]], he has reappointed Viceroy of the Deccan with the title of Asaf Jah.
He founded the Asaf Jah dynasty. His successors were known as the Nizams of Hyderabad.
Asaf Jah ruled the Deccan with a firm hand, crushed the rebellious and powerful zamindars, and established a strong administration.
He put his nominee, Anwar-ud-din, on the throne of Arcot.
After he died in 1748, Hyderabad became easy prey to powerful neighbors.
European trading companies started interfering in the domestic politics of Hyderabad for their selfish gains.
The last ruler of the Asaf Jahi dynasty, Mir Osman Ali Khan is credited for various reforms in education and development.
He set up Osmania University, State Bank of Hyderabad, South India's first Airport- The Begumpet Airport, etc.
