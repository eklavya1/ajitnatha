## Determination of MSP
in formulating the recommendations in respect of the level of minimum support prices and other non-price measures, the commission takes into account, apart from a comprehensive view of the entire
structure of the economy of a particular commodity or group of commodities, the following factors:-
cost of production
changes in input prices
input-output price parity
trends in market prices
demand and supply
inter-crop price parity
effect on industrial cost structure
effect on the cost of living
effect on the general price level
international price situation
parity between prices paid and prices received by the farmers.
effect on issue prices and implications for subsidy

It is a form of market intervention by the [[Government]] of [[India]] to insure agricultural producers against any sharp fall in farm prices.
The minimum support prices are announced by the Government of India at the beginning of the sowing season for certain crops.
It is announced by GOI on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).
MSP is price fixed by the Government of India to protect the producer - farmers - against excessive falls in price during bumper production years.
	The minimum support prices are a guaranteed price for their produce from the Government.
	The major objectives are to support the farmers from distress sales and to procure food grains for public distribution.
	In case the market price for the commodity falls below the announced minimum price due to bumper production and glut in the market, govt. agencies purchase the entire quantity offered by the farmers at the announced minimum price.
Minimum support prices are currently announced for 24 commodities including seven cereals ([[paddy]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[jowar]], [[bajra]], [[maize]] and [[ragi]]); five pulses (gram, arhar/tur, moong, urad, and lentil); eight oilseeds (groundnut, rapeseed/mustard, toria, soybean, sunflower seed, sesamum, safflower seed and nigerseed); copra, raw [[cotton]], raw [[jute]], and de-husked [[coconut]].
Such minimum support prices are fixed at the incentive level, so as to induce the farmers to make the capital investments for the improvement of their farm and to motivate them to adopt improved crop production technologies to step up their [[production]] and thereby their net income.
In the absence of such a guaranteed price, there is a concern that farmers may shift to other crops causing a shortage in these commodities.
