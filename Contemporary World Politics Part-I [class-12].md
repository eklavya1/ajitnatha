# Contemporary World Politics Part-I [class-12]

* Author: [NCERT]()

The end of the Cold War is usually seen as the beginning of the contemporary era in world politics which is the subject matter of this book. — location: [11]()

---
These were accompanied by a real ideological conflict as well, a difference over the best and the most appropriate way of organising political, economic, and social life all over the world. — location: [43]()

---
the Allied Forces, led by the US, Soviet Union, Britain and France defeated the Axis Powers led by Germany, Italy and Japan, ending the Second World War (1939-1945). — location: [52]()

---
The First World War had earlier shaken the world between 1914 and 1918. — location: [54]()

---
Critics of the US decision to drop the bombs have argued that the US knew that Japan was about to surrender and that it was unnecessary to drop the bombs.They suggest that the US action was intended to stop the Soviet Union from making military and political gains in Asia and elsewhere and to show Moscow that the United States was supreme. US supporters have argued that the dropping of the atomic bombs was necessary to end the war quickly and to stop further loss of American and Allied lives. Whatever the motives, the consequence of the end of the second world war was the rise of two new powers on the global stage. With the defeat of [[Germany]] and Japan, the devastation of [[Europe]] and in many other parts of the world, the United States and the Soviet Union became the greatest powers in the world with the ability to influence events anywhere on earth. — location: [57]()

They were also important for ideological reasons. The loyalty of allies suggested that the superpowers were winning the war of ideas as well, that liberal democracy and capitalism were better than [[socialism]] and communism, or vice versa. — location: [140]()

[[mod his 26|Russia]] was now accepted as the successor state of the Soviet Union. It inherited the Soviet seat in the UN Security Council. [[mod his 26|Russia]] accepted all the international treaties and commitments of the Soviet Union. — location: [445]()

---
there may be more general lessons to be drawn from this very important case. — location: [455]()

---
Why did the system become so weak and why did the economy stagnate? The answer is partially clear. The Soviet economy used much of its resources in maintaining a nuclear and military arsenal and the development of its satellite states in Eastern Europe and within the Soviet system (the five Central Asian Republics in particular). This led to a huge economic burden that the system could not cope with. At the same time, ordinary citizens became more knowledgeable about the economic advance of the West. They could see the disparities — location: [459]()

---
This was called ‘the largest garage sale in history’, as valuable industries were undervalued and sold at throwaway prices. — location: [571]()

---
The old system of social welfare was systematically destroyed. The withdrawal of government subsidies pushed large sections of the people into poverty. The middle classes were pushed to the periphery of society, and the academic and intellectual manpower disintegrated or migrated. A mafia emerged in most of these countries and started controlling many economic activities. Privatisation led to new disparities. Post-Soviet states, especially [[mod his 26|Russia]], were divided between rich and poor regions. — location: [580]()

---
The Central Asian Republics are areas with vast hydrocarbon resources, which have brought them economic benefit. Central [[Asia]] has also become a zone of competition between outside powers and [[oil]] companies. The region is next to [[mod his 26|Russia]], China, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and close to West Asia. After 11 September 2001, the US wanted military bases in the region and paid the governments of all Central Asian states to hire bases and to allow airplanes — location: [604]()

The First Gulf War revealed the vast technological gap that had opened up between the US military capability and that of other states. The highly publicised use of so-called ‘smart bombs’ by the US led some observers to call this a ‘computer war’. Widespread television coverage also made it a ‘video game war’, with viewers around the world watching the destruction of Iraqi forces live on TV in the comfort of their living rooms. — location: [760]()

One airliner each crashed into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Centre in New York. A third aircraft crashed into the Pentagon building in Arlington, Virginia, where the US Defence Department is headquartered. The fourth aircraft, presumably bound for the Capitol building of the US Congress, came down in a field in Pennsylvania. — location: [787]()

---
The bedrock of contemporary US power lies in the overwhelming superiority of its military power. American military dominance today is both absolute and relative. In absolute terms, the US today has military capabilities that can reach any point on the planet accurately, lethally and in real time, thereby crippling the adversary while its own forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. — location: [838]()

---
The US today spends more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. Furthermore, a large chunk of the Pentagon’s budget goes into military research and development, or, in other words, technology. Thus, the military dominance of the US is not just based on higher military spending, but on a qualitative gap, a technological chasm that no other power can at present conceivably span. — location: [842]()

---
Where US military capability has thus far been shown to have serious weaknesses is in policing an occupied territory. — location: [852]()

---
Imperial powers through history have used military forces to accomplish only four tasks: to conquer, deter, punish and police. — location: [850]()

---
It is the naval power of the hegemon that underwrites the law of the sea and ensures freedom of navigation in international waters. Since the decline of British naval power after the Second World War, the multi-oceanic US Navy has played this role. — location: [865]()

---
As we know, the US is present in all parts of the world, in all sectors of the world economy and in all areas of technology. The US share of the world economy remains an enormous 28 per cent. — location: [877]()

The idea that business is a profession that depends upon skills that can be taught in a university is uniquely American. — location: [887]()

---
This third sense of hegemony is about the capacity to ‘manufacture consent’. — location: [893]()

---
Hegemony arises when the dominant class or country can win the consent of dominated classes, by persuading the dominated classes to view the world in a manner favourable to the ascendancy of the dominant class. — location: [894]()

---
The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military power and economic prowess, but also on its cultural presence. Whether we choose to recognise the fact or not, all ideas of the good life and personal success, most of the dreams of individuals and societies across the globe, are dreams churned out by practices prevailing in twentieth-century America. — location: [905]()

---
‘good life’ that were not available in their own country. During the Cold War, the US found it difficult to score victories against the Soviet Union in the realm of hard power. It was in the area of structural power and soft power that the US scored notable victories. — location: [912]()

“Talking shop? Yes, there are a lot of speeches and meetings at the U.N., especially during the annual sessions of the General Assembly. But as Churchill put it, jaw-jaw is better than war-war. Isn’t it better to have one place where all… countries in the world can get together, bore each other sometimes with their words rather than bore holes into each other on the battlefield?” — location: [1790]()

The US can and does use this power to “split” the rest of the world and to reduce opposition to its policies. — location: [2092]()

---
In responding to the threat of war, a government has three basic choices: to surrender; to prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level; and to defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives and to turn back or defeat the attacking forces altogether. — location: [2239]()

---
Governments may choose to surrender when actually confronted by war, but they will not advertise this as the policy of the country. Therefore, security policy is concerned with preventing war, which is called deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. — location: [2242]()

---
Traditional security policy has a third component called balance of power. — location: [2245]()

---
A good part of maintaining a balance of power is to build up one’s military power, although economic and techno-logical power are also important since they are the basis for military power. — location: [2250]()

---
Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. — location: [2352]()

Western geopolitical thinking about resources has been dominated by the relationship of trade, war and power, at the core of which were overseas resources and maritime navigation. Since sea power itself rested on access to timber, naval timber supply became a key priority for major European powers from the 17th century onwards. The critical importance of ensuring uninterrupted supply of strategic resources, in particular oil, was well established both during the First World War and the Second World War. — location: [2783]()

---
Resource geopolitics is all about who gets what, when, where and how. — location: [2782]()

---
However, oil continues to be the most important resource in global strategy. — location: [2793]()

The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. — location: [2795]()

The ability of ideas, capital, commodities and people to move more easily from one part of the world to another has been made possible largely by technological advances. The pace of these flows may vary. For instance, the movement of capital and commodities will most likely be quicker and wider than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. — location: [3011]()
