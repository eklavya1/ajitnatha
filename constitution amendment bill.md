The Constitution of India provides the power of amending the constitution to Parliament in Article 368 of Part XX of the Constitution.
It can be initiated only in either house of the Parliament, not in State Legislature.
The bill can be introduced either by a minister or by a private member and *does not require prior permission of the President*.
The bill must be passed in both the House by a special majority (two-thirds of the members of the House present and voting).
In case of disagreement between the two houses, there is no provision to summon a Joint Sitting of parliament.
After duly passed by both the houses, the bill is sent to the President for assent and he can neither withhold his assent to the bill nor return the bill for reconsideration.
After the President's assent, the bill becomes law.
