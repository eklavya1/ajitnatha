Rajmannar Commission was set up by the then DMK Government of Tamil Nadu in 1969 under the Chairmanship of Dr P.V. Rajamanar. It was appointed to look into the question regarding the relationship that should subsist between the Centre and the States in a federal set-up. It submitted its report in 1971. It demanded readjustment of the VII schedule and residuary power to the states. Its other important recommendations are given in the following:
	The setting of an Inter-State council immediately
	Finance commission to be made a permanent body
	Deletion of Articles 356, 357, and 365 which dealt with the Presidentâ€™s rule
	*Abolition of All-India Services (lAS, IPS, and IFS)*
	Planning Commission to be replaced by a statutory body
	
*The Central government completely ignored its recommendations.*
