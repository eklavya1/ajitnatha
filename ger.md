- Jera (also Jeran, Jeraz) is the conventional name of the j-rune ᛃ of the Elder Futhark, from a reconstructed Common **ger**manic stem *jēra- meaning "harvest, (good) year".

The corresponding letter of the Gothic alphabet is Gothic 𐌾, named 𐌾𐌴𐍂 (jēr), also expressing /j/.

The Elder Futhark rune gives rise to the Anglo-Frisian ᛄ /j/, named gēr /jeːr/, and ᛡ /io/, named ior, and to the Younger Futhark  ár rune ᛅ, which stands for /a/, as the /j/ phoneme disappears in late Proto-Norse.

Note that ᛆ also can be a variation of dotted Isaz used for /e/; e.g. in Dalecarlian runes.
