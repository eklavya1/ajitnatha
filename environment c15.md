Environment Class 15

## Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
(2:06 PM)

If any kind of project such as Mining will cause air, water, and land pollution. It can also affect the wildlife. Even it can impact human who lives in those areas.
Example of the Thermal power plant: Burning of coal results in pollutants such as CO2, Fly Ash.
Nuclear Power Plant that creates radiation pollutants.
Infrastructure Projects such as dams, ports, highways.
EIA is a process of assessment, evaluation of impact not only in present but also in the future.
Dilemma: Whether we want the project or not. One area we want the socio-economic development. Other is the protection of the Environment. EIA connects both and tries to make the balance between the two.
EIA works on the principle of sustainable development. We need development but not one the cost of the environment.
In India initially in the 1950s when we started the river valley project then we took the EIA but in an informal way. In a formal way, EIA started in India in 1986 with the Environment Protect Act, 1986 as the base for it. Under it, the EIA rules were notified first in 1994. Then it was revised in 2006 and 2020.

Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is a process or a study which-

Predicts the effect of a proposed industrial/infrastructural project on the environment.
Prevent the proposed activity or project from being approved without proper oversight or taking adverse consequences into account.
It compares various alternatives for a project and seeks to identify the one which represents the best combination of economic and environmental costs and benefits.
EIA: Assessment or study
Prediction of potential impacts on the environment.
Prevention of loss to environment (Mitigation Strategy) or there has to be environmental management Plan (EMP).
Comparison of alternatives. It should be the best combination of environmental and economic cost and benefits.

## EIA
(1:38 PM)

Proposed project: It requires land acquisition
It requires land acquisition for that we have LARR Act, 2013. Here we conduct a Social Impact Assessment (SIA).
After the land acquisition, we require project development. Here we need an EIA study as per EPA, 1986. It will result in the EIA report.
Then at the last stage, it is provided approval or it denies the approval.
Any project requiring environmental clearance first needs to undergo a thorough screening and scoping process by the regulatory authorities and thereafter a draft EIA report is sent for public consultation.
Public consultation takes place at two levels. One before the project development and one before the proposal.
Stakeholders: The first stakeholder is the project developer. The second stakeholder will be local communities. The third stakeholder is the government authorities at different levels who prepare and review the EIA report and give approval.
The last public consultation is done for the participatory approach.

## Environmental Clearance Process in India
(1:52 PM)

Environmental clearance in India is carried out under the notified EIA rules under Environmental Protect Act 1986.
Presently, environmental clearance is given under the EIA rules, 2006. Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change has come out with the draft EIA rules, 2020, which will replace 2006 rules with the new mechanism.
As per the EIA rules 2006, environmental Impact Assessment is required for: (a) Any new economic activities or projects. (b) Expansion or modernization of existing projects. (c) Any change in product mix in a manufacturing unit.
Under the EIA rules 2006, there are four stages of Environmental clearance in India- screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal.
Screening is done as per the nature of the project.
Scoping decides what parameters needed to be studied.
Discussion of the EIA report is done under public consultation.
At the stage of appraisal, the review of the EIA report is done.

## SCREENING          

In this stage, the projects are categorized into category A and category B. Where all the projects under category A need to undergo the process of the EIA.
Category B projects are further classified into Category B1 and Category B2 on the basis of their scope and potential impact and only the project under category B2 are exempted from the cumbersome process.
Screening is required for Category B projects only.
All Category A projects are approved by the Central EIA authority, whereas category B1 projects are approved by the State EIA authority.
All the Category A projects are big projects with a high impact on the environment and humans.
Examples are Nuclear Parks and infrastructure, large infrastructure projects, oil and gas exploration projects such as the Krishna Godavari project, etc.
The statutory body, Central EIA Authority (CEIAA) acts under the MoEFCC.
Examples of the categories B are Cement plants, small thermal power plants, chemical units, etc.
At the state level, the State EIA Authority will work.

## SCOPING             

At this stage parameters to assess environmental impacts according to the terms of reference (ToR) are prepared, depending on the nature and category of the project.
Initial preliminary EIA study is carried out based on these parameters. Based on baseline data, and the EIA report is prepared.
The whole exercise is carried out by a trained third-party consultant hired and paid by the project developer.

## PUBLIC CONSULTATION

A public hearing is conducted on the EIA report submitted by the project developer.
The place, date, and time for the public hearing are advertised.
The local community participates in a public hearing which is supervised by the State Pollution Control Board of the state or central pollution control board of the union territories.
Of video recording of the entire discussion is made and a written opinion of the participating local community is also recorded.

## APPRAISAL

In this stage, the review of the EIA report and public hearing documents is done by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC).
Based on the decision-making by the EAC, the project is approved or rejected.
If the project is rejected, the project developer has to redesign the project and submit a new EIA report for environmental clearance.
If the project is approved, the project developer can start the project and has to submit a progress report every six months.

Comparison of EIA Rule 2006 and 2020               (3:21 PM)

Particulars


EIA Rule, 2006


EIA Rule, 2020

Period for the public consultation


45 days (One and half months)


40 days

Monitoring period (progress report has to be submitted by the project developer)


Every six months


Once in a year

Environmental Clearance


Power has been decentralized between state and central government.

Projects have been categorized in Category A and B (B1 and B2)


Decentralization of power between state and central government.

The Projects has been categorized in Category A and B (B1 and B2)

Environment Clearance process


Four stages of Environmental clearance- screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal.

Category A- Central EIA Authority

Category B1- State EIA Authority

Category B2- Exempted




For Category A and B1 project five stages of Environmental clearance in India- scoping, preparing draft EIA report, public consultation, preparation of final EIA report, and appraisal.

For the B2 project: Requires appraisal has to be placed before the Appraisal committee.

(1) There will be appraisal and approval of the Environmental Management Programme (EMP).

(2) Verification of its completeness by the appointed authority.

(3) Grant/ rejection of clearance.

Provision for approval of prior environmental clearance


Not applicable


(1) Provision of prior Environmental Clearance.

(2) An appeal can be made to the NGT against prior environmental clearance.

## Issue and Problems
(3:55 PM)

It takes a long time for the clearance (Almost 200 days to get clearance).
Delaying in getting the clearance due to Red Tapism (Bureaucratic Delay).
Corruption at higher-end (Collusion between government and developer).
Collusion between the developer and EIA consultant (Manipulation of the data in EIA Report).
Lack of comprehensiveness to understand the technical aspects of the EIA report.
EIA report not in the regional language.
Delay in the availability of EIA report to the local community affected by the project.
Law and order situation during the public hearing.
Closed-door meetings and lack of transparency in the appraisal process.

### SOLUTION
(4:10 PM)

e-portal for the EIA (PARIVESH).
Quality check on the EIA consultants and blacklisting of consultants for wrongdoing.
Summary report, preferably in regional language, of EIA report.
Transparency in Appraisal.
Inclusion of members of civil society in the EAC.
Eligibility qualification of the members of the EAC.

The topic for the next class discussion: Climate Change, CC impact, IPCC, etc.
