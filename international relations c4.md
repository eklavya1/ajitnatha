a brief review of previous class has been given. (1:14 pm)

## india & phase of non-alignment-phases
india & phase of non-alignment-phases (1:20 pm):

## phase-i(1947-62)
phase-i(1947-62):

it's during this phase policy of non-alignment has been followed in a true sense i.e, india was truly non-aligned with respect to 2 blocs.
this phase comes to end with sino-indian war.

## phase-ii (1962-1990)
phase-ii (1962-1990):

it was now realized that policy of non-alignment has failed to secure core national interests of country ie., to protect territorial integrity of country.
in 1948 war with pakistan, india lost pok as well as gilgit-baltistan region to pakistan.
in 1962 war, india lost aksai chin to china.
while foreign policies are expected to secure country's national interests, a country's goals defined in terms of national interests, india's policy of non-alignment has conspicuously failed in doing so.
also, development of pakistan-china-us axis created concerns for india
as a consequence, india signed peace friendship & cooperation treaty with soviet union in 1971.
thus, though india continued with policy of non-alignment, it had a pro-ussr tilt so much so that during this phase, it came to symbolize reflexive anti-americanism.

## phase-iii(1990 onwards)
phase-iii(1990 onwards):

following structural changes in international politics(disintegration of ussr, usa as then single superpower) & structural changes in domestic, economic, & political structure(new economic policy), raison d etre(reason for existence) of policy of non-alignment was questioned.
there was no real support for a policy of non-alignment either from congress party or bjp, then-dominant parties of india. it was left parties that continued to emphasize policy of non-alignment.
today, in age of complex interdependence, when multi-polarity is upon us, policy of non-alignment cannot be prime construct of india's foreign policy. however, it continues to be description of country's foreign policy more b/c of inability of indian political elite to come out as grand a strategy as policy of non-alignment.
strategic/political community has come out with successive formulations to replace idea of non-alignment namely:
strategic autonomy -soon acquired connotation associated with policy of non-alignment i.e., reflexive anti-americanism.
multiple alignments-indian civil society presented a document c/a nam 4.0-it suggests that non-alignment in present times is in fact practiced through seeking multiple alliances. however, at times symbolizes opportunism.
issue-based coalitions/partnerships-it also did not gain necessary construct.
advancing prosperity & influence: present external affairs minister jaishankar chose to describe this as india's international partnership.

## introduction of nam
introduction of nam (1:59 pm):

nam embodies principles of multilateralism, non-intervention, sovereign equality, & self-determination.
nam has consistently advocated peaceful co-existence, democratization of international system; equitable & sustainable development among other things.

## evolution of nam
evolution of nam(2:03 pm):

it evolved out of concerted efforts of individual non-aligned states to build a common front against superpower domination & new imperialism.
5 countries led foundation of nam-india (nehru), indonesia (sukarno), ghana(kwame nkrumah), egypt(naseer), & yugoslavia (tito).
it's evolved through a series of conferences- asian relations conference in  new delhi in 1947, bandung conference in 1955 in indonesia, 1st nam summit was held in belgrade(yugoslavia) in 1961.
in 1961, there were 25 founding/participating countries. at present, nam comprises 120 member countries, 17 observer countries, & 10 observer organizations. pakistan joined nam in 1979.

## features of nam
features of nam(2:17 pm):

it does not have a formal constitution or a permanent secretariat.
administration of nam is non-hierarchical & rotational.
presidency rotates b/w member countries & continues until next summit.
decisions are made by consensus which requires substantial agreement but not necessarily unanimously.
conditions for membership: a country should not be a member of multi-lateral military alliances concluded in context of great power rivalry; a country should not have a bilateral military agreement with great powers or a member of regional defense pacts; a country should not have conceded military to a foreign power; country should consistently support for a national movement.

## achievements of nam
achievements of nam(2:41 pm):

1960s-goal was support for national freedom struggle for nations in asia & africa. this was only successful phase of nam-golden phase of nam.
1970s-establishment of new international economic order-expected to be just to countries of south.
1980s- nuclear disarmament.
1990s-reason for existence of nam has been questioned.
certain founding members such as egypt suggested that nam should be dissolved. however, majority of member countries including india were of opinion that relevance of nam was not limited to its opposition to bloc politics. it also symbolizes aspirations such as building a  just/democratic world order based on sovereign equality, south-south cooperation, & strengthening international law & world politics. nam continues to remain relevant even after end of cold war.
however, soon it was realized that business as usual approach will not suffice. there is a need to revitalize nam. therefore in havana summit of 2006, new agenda was adopted.
a few of agendas are:
to promote multilateralism.
to oppose excessive hegemonic domination of usa.
to promote north-south & south-south cooperation.
present status of nam: nam is facing a crisis of relevance & it's in a state of comatose. reasons for this state are:
end of cold war & bloc politics.; lack of substantial achievements.
lack of solidarity among member countries-lack of internal solidarity prevents member countries from offering a counter to great powers-be it usa or erstwhile ussr or present day's china which seeks global dominance.
lack of institutionalization-not having a formal constitution or a separate secretariat was part of deliberate choice so that organization retains dynamic nature & is not caught up in bureaucratic processes. however, lack of institutionalization has become 1 of its major weaknesses. it affects work of nam in period intervening 2 summits.
several of member countries are not truly non-aligned. india, for instance, during 70s & 80s was tilted towards ussr & presently has been co-opted by west. nam getting radicalized under leadership of iran, cuba, etc.
yugoslavia does not exist anymore while egypt is no longer interested. indian pm has not attended 2 consecutive nam summits in venezuela & azerbaijan. modi became 1st indian pm to not attend a nam summit.
however, recent virtual summit in context of covid pandemic was attended by indian pm. today, nam does not have leadership or direction to move forward.

## has nam lost relevance for india?
has nam lost relevance for india?:

present administration makes no illusion of a loss of interest in nam. however, nam continues to be of relevance to india.
it's biggest grouping of developing countries outside un general assembly.
though india is in club of new elites like g-20 & brics, it continues to be a developing country.
india is home to world's largest poor & malnourished children. in some parts of country, there exists acute poverty which is comparable & yet times more than that of sub-saharan countries.
india has aspirations of gaining a permanent unsc seat & nam countries can act as voting groups in support of india in un general assembly.
nam offers a natural platform for india platform. nam is source of soft power for india.
these developing countries can serve as markets for india.
though pursuit of close relations with usa is cited as primary reason for india losing interest in nam, india, & us have a fundamental contradictory position on certain issues & agendas. for ex, with respect to trade in intellectual properties.

## relevance of india to nam
relevance of india to nam (4:02 pm):

it's a matter of fact that india needs nam & nam needs india.
india can provide leadership, direction, & resources to nam.
india is more likely only country that can moderate nam platform & act as a bridge b/w countries of north & south. therefore, it can develop nam as a platform for south-south as well as north-south cooperation.
thus, nam is important platform in pursuit of india's national interests.
