Amoghavarsha I:
o Amoghavarsha I (800—878) C.E. was a Rashtrakuta king, the greatest ruler of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, and one of the great kings of India.
o He ruled for a long period of 64 years.
o He had lost control over Malwa and Gangavadi.
o Yet his reign was popular for cultural development.
o He was a follower of Jainism.
• Jinasena was his chief preceptor.
o He was also a patron of letters and he himself wrote the famous Kannada work, Kavirajamarga.
o He had also built the Rashtrakuta capital, the city of Malkhed or Manyakheda.
Amoghavarsha apparently renounced his throne and became a disciple of Jinasena in the early 9th century.
