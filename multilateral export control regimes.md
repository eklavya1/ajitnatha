Recently, Philippines has signed a deal with BrahMos Aerospace Private Ltd. for supply of a shore-based anti-ship variant of BrahMos supersonic cruise missile.
This is first export order for missile, a joint product of India and Russia.

MECR are voluntary and non-binding agreements created by major supplier countries that have agreed to co-operate in their effort to prevent and regulate transfer of certain military and dual-use technology.
It aims at preventing proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).
They are independent of United Nations.
Their regulations apply only to members and it is not obligatory for a country to join.
India is now a member of three of four MECRs, except Nuclear supplier Group.
There are currently four such regimes under MECR:
• Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), for control of nuclear-related technology.
• Australia Group (AG) for control of chemical and biological technology that could be weaponized.
• Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) for control of rockets and other aerial vehicles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction.
• Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies.
