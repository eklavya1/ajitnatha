# Law of Gravitation
(1:03 PM)
Any two objects in the Universe having mass attract each other by the force of â€˜gravitationâ€™.
The magnitude of the force is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them. 
### Escape Velocity
It is the minimum velocity required by an object to overcome the gravitational field of a bigger object. For earth, escape velocity is 11.2 km/second.
# Star
Star is a lump of dust and gas having its own light.
# Planet
(1:14 PM)
It should revolve around the Sun.
It should have enough gravity to attain a spherical shape.
- It should have enough gravity to clear off its surroundings.
	- ([[pluto]] fails this criterion, it has a sizable/massive moon).
# Asteroid
Rocky objects.
They revolve around Sun.
Found between Mars and Jupiter.
E.g. Bennu: NASAâ€™s OSIRIS-Rex Mission is sent to Asteroid Bennu.
1/600 chances of colliding with earth, hence NASA is studying it.
Ryugu asteroid has been mined by Japanâ€™s Hayabusa-II (which means it has brought back the mined material from this asteroid). 
Near-Earth Objects: Some asteroids are found on the path of Earthâ€™s orbit. 
Trojan (Beyond Jupiter): Those found beyond the orbit of planet Jupiter.  
# Comets
Comets are icy objects having: â€˜nucleusâ€™ (made up of dust) and a tail (made up of gases).
Gases include Methane, Ammonia, Carbon dioxide, etc.
The tail of the comet is temporary, is evident only when it is near the sun.
Near the sun, the tail of the comet catches fire, due to the flammable gases present.
Comets are of two types: Short-period comet (origin - Kuiper belt) and Long-period comet (origin - Oort Cloud).
Meteoroids: These are chunks of asteroids/comets.
Meteors: When they enter the earthâ€™s atmosphere and burn due to friction (often seen as shooting stars).
Meteorites: A meteoroid that lands upon the Earthâ€™s surface. (E.g. Crater Lake/Lonar Lake of Maharastra)
# The life cycle of the Small Star
(1:39 PM)
Dust and gas get accumulated over a huge area (in an area of 1 to 10 light-years it happens in billions of years).
First Phase (Nebullar Phase, womb): This phase is known as the nebula phase.
Dust particles are small, but in abundance. 
Hydrogen atoms combine to produce Helium (fusion), hence producing stellar energy and neutrinos.
The second phase (Infant Phase): Protostar (the star will be in the inception phase)
Third Phase: Main-sequence star (Youth phase of star) E.g. our Sun is a main-sequence star. 
Fourth Phase: More than 90% Hydrogen is used. Fusion reaction intensifies. This is known as Red Giant (star is bigger in size). 
Final stage: Planetary nebula comes out when star collapses and dense object is left (White Dwarf).
# Life Cycle of Big Star
(1:54 PM)
Gas and dust will accumulate.
The size for a big star, the area will be more than 10 light-years (of the gaseous nebula).
All stages are the same up to mainline star formation (similar to small star).
It will eventually become Red SuperGiant.
After Hydrogen is over, it will consume Helium.
Eventually, He, Carbon, Oxygen, and up to Silicon and finally Iron.
In big star, we are getting Iron. 
Since Iron is the heaviest, it will sit at the core.
Fe (innermost), Si, C/Oxygen, Be, etc.
It will collapse (The Iron core will collapse), it will result in a Supernova explosion. 
The medium star will die as a neutron star.
The large star will become a black hole. 
Stages: Nebula-Protostar-Main Sequence Star- (Red Giant or RedSuper Giant), then small will become white dwarf, the medium will turn into a neutron star, larger ones will end up as black holes.
# Chandrashekhar Limit
(2:08 PM)
If the mass of the core is less than 1.44 mass of sun: It is going to die as White Dwarf.
If the mass of the core is between 1.44 to 3 times that of the sun: It is going to die as Neutron Star.
If the mass of the core is above 3 times that of the sun: It is going to die as a Black Hole.
# White Dwarf
(2:15 PM)
It is formed when a small star collapses at the carbon/oxygen core. 
This collapse is so intense that every electron in each atom reaches the first orbit, due to which volume decreases and hence density increases. 
This state in quantum mechanics is called degenerate gas. 
White Dwarfs are dense glowing objects in the universe, without any fusion mechanism.
# Neutron Star
These are formed due to the death of medium stars. 
When a star collapses at the iron core, all electrons in each atom enter the nucleus, where they feed upon the protons to give neutrons. Because of this, only neutrons are left in the star, that is why they are called neutron stars. 
These are also called as â€˜pulsarsâ€™ because they accelerate any particle entering their magnetic field. 
One tablespoon of a neutron-star material will weigh millions of tons.
# Supernova Explosion
These are extreme events in the cosmic realm, where a huge amount of energy is emitted and also elements heavier than iron, e.g. Uranium, Gold, etc. are formed. 
# Black Hole
(2:28 PM)
It is a very big object in the Universe, where the gravitational pull is so much, that even light cannot come out of it. 
The gravitation is so much because the entire mass of the black hole is concentrated at a one-dimensional point called â€˜singularityâ€™ 
Any object falling in the black hole loses its dimensions and attains one dimension or singularity, this process is called as â€˜spaghettificationâ€™. 
These are dead remains of a big star, that warps space-time infinitely. 
# Galaxy
(2:46 PM)
It is a collection of dust and gas, billions of stars and their staller systems all bound together by gravity via a black hole.
It means at the center of every galaxy, there is a black hole.
# Kuiper Belt
Kuiper Belt is a great ring of debris, found beyond Neptune.
It is an asteroid-like belt, but much bigger in size. 
These are remains of our solar system. 
Kuiper Belt is house to comets.
# Oort Cloud
At the distant edges of the Kuiper Belt, icy objects are found, known as Oort Clouds. 
The size of Oort Cloud may be bigger than the mountains on earth. 
# Heliosphere & Hydrogen Wall
When solar winds emanate from the sun, it forms a bubble/balloon-like sphere, 
This extends beyond the eight major planets, it goes much beyond Neptune.
This bubble is called as â€˜heliosphereâ€™.
This solar wind/heliosphere is unable to penetrate an area of hydrogen known as a hydrogen wall. This also marks the end of our Solar system. 
# Exoplanets
Planets beyond our solar system. 

# Goldilocks Zone
(3:05 PM)
Search for Earth-like planets in outer space. 

# Force Carriers
Strong Force (Force Carrier: Gluon), Range: 10^-15 meters (nucleus), application: Quarks.
Weak Force (Force Carrier: W and Z bosons) Range: 10^-13, Application: Beta Decay.
Electromagnetic Force: (Force carrier: Photons) Range: Infinite, Application: Electronics.
Gravitational Force: (Force Carrier: Gluon). Range: Infinite, Application: Solar System, Galaxies.

# Beta Decay
Beta-plus Decay: The number of protons is more than neutrons. Proton breaks into: Positron+Neutron+Neutrino
Beta-negative Decay: Neutron breaks into: Proton+electron+Antineutrino.

# Antimatter
(3:21 PM):
Antimatter shares all the property with the matter, like mass, but has opposite charge or sub-atomic characteristics, like spin.
Both matter and anti-matter were formed during the Big bang. 
But today antimatter is rare in our galaxy. 
But they can be found in other stars and galaxies. 
When matter and antimatter come close to each other, they annihilate flashing a lot of energy. 
E.g. Positron, anti-hydrogen, etc.

# Dark Matter
(3:42 PM)
It is a matter that does not interact even with light. 
That is why it is very difficult to locate a dark matter.

## Evidence of Dark Matter: 
High galactic orbital velocity than expected.
Gravitational lensing more than expected. 
Dark World (Dark matter + Dark energy).
Composition of Universe (100):
Out of 100 units of the Universe: 
27 is dark matter.
68 is dark energy.
Only 5 is visible matter and energy. (4 is Hydrogen & Helium, 0.5 is Stars and Galaxies, 0.3 is neutrinos, 0.2 is heavy elements).

# Bose-Einstien Consdensate
The 5th State of Matter
At zero Kelvin (-273 Degrees Celsius), the solid particles start to behave like waves. At such a state, every atom will lose its property (super unexcited supercooled stage) and will behave like a wave.

The topic for the next class: Dark Energy, Big Bang, etc.
