	- In Second Plan ([[1956]] - 61) the strategy of resource allocation to broad sectors as agriculture & Industry was based on two & four sector Model prepared by Prof. P C Mahalanobis. The Second plan was conceived in an atmosphere of economic stability. It was felt agriculture could be accorded lower priority. The Plan Focused on rapid industrialization- heavy & basic industries and advocated huge imports through foreign loans. The Industrial Policy 1956 was based on the establishment of a socialistic pattern of society as the goal of economic policy. 
***************************************
- • Third Five Year Plan: At its conception, it was felt that the Indian economy has entered a “take-off stage”.  Therefore,  its aim was to make  India a  'self-reliant'  and  'self-generating economy. Based on the experience of the first two plans  (agricultural [[production]] was seen as a limiting factor in India’s economic [[development]]),  [[agriculture]] was given top priority to support the exports and industry. The  Plan was a thorough failure in reaching the targets due to unforeseen [[events]]   -   Chinese aggression (1962), Indo-Pak [[war]] ([[1965]]), severe drought [[1965]]-66. Due to conflicts, the approach during the later phase was shifted from [[development]] to defence   &   [[development]].
 - • Three Annual Plans (1966-69) euphemistically described as Plan holiday. Failure of the Third  Plan that of the [[devaluation]] of the rupee (to boost exports)  along with the inflationary recession led to the postponement of the Fourth FYP. Three Annual Plans were introduced instead. Prevailing crisis in [[agriculture]] and serious food shortage necessitated the emphasis on [[agriculture]] during the Annual Plans.
 - • Fifth Five Year Plan: It proposed to achieve two main objectives: 'removal of poverty' (Garibi Hatao) and 'attainment of self-reliance. Promotion of high rate of growth, better distribution of income and significant growth in the domestic rate of savings were seen as key instruments The Minimum Needs Programme (MNP) was introduced in the first year of the Fifth Five Year Plan (1974–78), to provide certain basic minimum needs and improve the living standards of people. It aims at the "social and economic [[development]] of the community, particularly the underprivileged and underserved [[population]]".It also promoted equality as from now poor will be able to get basic needs. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.
 - • The Twenty Point Programme was initially launched by Prime Minister Indira [[Gandhi]] in 1975 (during the Fifth Five Year Plan (1974-49). It was subsequently restructured in 1982 and again in 1986. With the introduction of new [[policies]] and programmes, it has been finally restructured in 2006 and it has been in operation at present. The basic objective of the 20-Point Programme is to eradicate poverty and to improve the quality of life of the poor and the underprivileged [[population]] of the country. The monitoring of the programme at the centre has been assigned to the Ministry of [[Statistics]] and Programme Implementation. Hence
