The Rajamannar Committee ([[1971]]) recommended the deletion of Articles 356 and 357 from the constitution of India.
The necessary provisions for safeguards against arbitrary action of the ruling party at the Centre under Article 356 should be incorporated in the constitution.
The Rajamannar Committee emphasised that the governor of the state should not consider himself as an agent of the centre but play his role as the constitutional head of the State.
