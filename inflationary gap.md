it's a macroeconomic concept that measures difference b/w current level of real gdp & gross domestic product (gdp) that would exist if economy was operating at full employment.
for gap to be considered inflationary, current real gdp must be higher than potential gdp.
inflationary gap exists when demand for goods & services exceeds production due to factors such as higher levels of overall employment, increased trade activities, or increased govemment expenditure.
however, foll policies or decisions cn be taken by govt to reduce inflationary gap such as reductions in govt spending, increase in tax rate, increasing interest rate increases, transfer payment reductions, & issuing bonds & securities.
dated g-secs are long-term securities that carry a fixed or floating coupon (interest rate) which is paid on face value, on a half-yearly basis. generally, tenor of dated securities ranges from 5 years to 40 years. issuing fresh dated securing will reduce available money & demand in market consequently. therefore it'll lead to a reduction in inflationary gap.
