- a congregational mosque or friday mosque (arabic: مَسْجِد جَامِع, masjid jāmi‘, or simply: جَامِع, jāmi‘; turkish: cami), or sometimes great mosque or grand mosque (arabic: جامع كبير, jāmi‘ kabir; turkish: ulu cami), is a mosque for hosting the friday noon prayers known as jumu'ah. it can also host the eid prayers in situations when there is no musalla or eidgah available nearby to host the prayers. in early islamic history, the number of congregational mosques in one city was strictly limited. as cities and populations grew over time, it became more common for many mosques to host friday prayers in the same area.
