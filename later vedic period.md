## polity & administration during later vedic period
samiti was larger general assembly of people & it was different than sabha in terms of function & composition. sabha was a smaller selected body, which functioned as lower court.
due to increase in complexity of society & political structure, some new officials were appointed by state namely:
• suta (charioteer),
• sangrahitri (treasurer),
• bhagadugha (collector of taxes),
• akshvapa (accountant)
• gramini (head of a village),
• sthapati (chief judge),
• takshan (carpenter),
• kshatri (chamberlain), etc.

o administrative machinery was highly organized & became an efficient instrument for ruling over a large kingdom.
legal institutions became more focused. king administered justice & wielded rod of punishment.
petty offences were left to "village judges."
punishments for crime were rather severe.
for evidence, eye-witness was more important than informer.
law was also very clear on question of inheritance of property, ownership of land, etc.
father's property was inherited by sons alone.
daughters could inherit it only if she was only child or there were no male issues.

# later vedic culture
aryans further moved towards east in later vedic period.
satapatha brahmana refers to expansion of aryans to eastern gangetic plains.
several tribal groups & kingdoms are mentioned in later vedic [[literature]].
one important development during this period is growth of large kingdoms.
kuru & panchala kingdoms flourished in beginning.
after fall of kurus & panchalas, kingdoms like kosala, kasi, & videha came into prominence.
famous ruler of kasi was ajatasatru.
later vedic texts also refer to three divisions of india — aryavarta (northem india), madhyadesa (central india), & dakshinapatha (southern india).
# political organization
historian romila thapar characterizes developments in first millennium bce as movement from lineage to state.
larger kingdoms were formed during later vedic period.
many jana or tribes were amalgamated to form janapadas or rashtras in later vedic period.
hence royal power had increased along with increase in size of kingdom.
legitimization of kingship became important with performance of various sacrifices such as rajasuya (consecration ceremony), asvamedha(horse sacrifice), & vajpeya (chariot race).
kings also assumed titles like rajavisvajanan, ahilabhuvanapathi, (lord of all earth), ekrat, & samrat (sole ruler).
importance of samiti & sabha had diminished during later vedic period.
# family
household became more structured & organized.
family was patriarchal with patrilineal descent.
relations within family were hierarchical. polygyny (taking many wives) was prevalent.
varnashrama system came into practice, which is division of life into 4 stages. they are brahmacharya, gruhasta, vanaprasta & sanyasin
# women
status of women declined as society became more structured & patriarchal family became more important.
though women had participated in rituals in rig vedic period, they were excluded in later vedic period.
