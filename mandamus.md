It is a command issued by a court to an authority directing it to perform a public duty imposed upon it by law.
Mandamus can be issued when the [[Government]] denies to itself a jurisdiction which it undoubtedly has under the law, or where an authority vested with a power improperly refuses to exercise it.
The function of the mandamus is to keep the public authorities within the limits of their jurisdiction while exercising public functions.
Mandamus can be issued to any kind of authority in respect of any type of function â€” administrative, legislative, quasi-judicial, and judicial.
Mandamus is used to enforce the performance of public duties by public authorities.
Mandamus is not issued when the Government is under no duty under the law.
When an authority fails in its legal duty to implement an order of a tribunal, a mandamus can be issued directing the authority to do so.
Thus, when the appellate transport tribunal accepted the applications of the petitioner for grant of permits, mandamus was issued to the concerned authority to issue the permits to the petitioner in terms of the tribunal order.
Mandamus is issued to enforce a mandatory duty which may not necessarily be a statutory duty.
