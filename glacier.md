glaciers are a bulk of ice moving under its weight.
it forms in areas where amassing of snow goes beyond its ablation over many years.
they are sensitive indicators of changing climate.
they are generally seen in snowfields.
this largest freshwater basin covers around 10% of land surface of earth.
out of total water on earth, 2.1% is in glaciers while 97.2% is in oceans and inland seas.

condition of glacier formation:
1. mean annual temperatures are close to freezing point.
2. winter precipitation produces significant accumulations of snow.
3. temperatures throughout rest of year do not result in complete loss of previous winter's snow accumulation.

according to topography and location of glacier, it can be categorized as mountain glacier (alpine glaciers) or continental glacier (ice sheets).
continental glacier moves outward in all directions whereas mountain glacier moves from a higher to a lower altitude.
