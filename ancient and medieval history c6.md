bhagwati sutra (jain text)
16 mahajanapadas:

initially, kashi & kosala were quite powerful but over period, magadh became most powerful mhajanapada.

rise of magadh as most powerful mahakjanapada

capital of magadh [[rajagriha]] was surrounded by _five mountains_ which in turn provided natural safety of capital.
magadh was situated on confluence of many rivers which in turn promoted trade & commerce through river channels.
himalayan rivers brought silt & [[moraine]] which in turn increase fertility in magadh area.
magadh was heavily forested which was a great source of medicinal plants & very good quality timber.
magadh was abode of iron reservoir with which they created very good quality tools & it further facilitated their growth.
society of magadh was unorthodox & rulers were enterprising.

history of magadh

haryanka dynasty: (founder- bimbisar- 554 bc-492 bc)

bimbisar followed policy of matrimonial alliances to further deepen his ties with powerful kingdoms such as he married-
mahakosala devi from kashi
chillana from licchavi (chillana was daughter of licchavi king chetak)
khema from madra (punjab area)
bimbisar militarily annexed anga mahajanapoada & placed it under his son ajatshatru.
bimbisar sent his famous physician jivaka to cure avanti ruler chanda pradyota who was suffering from jaundice.
bimbisar & ajatshastru were contemporaries of buddha.
ajatshatru in 492 assassinated his father bimbisar to become next ruler.
important events during ajatshatru: 
soon after accession to throne, he had to fight with kashi & licchavi.
later, kashi ruler prasenjit accepted peace with ajatshatru but licchavi continued their struggle.
as such, ajatshatru thoroughly defeated licchavis & completely destroyed their capital vaishali.
in this war, ajatshatru used 2 innovative war engines:
rathmusla- it was a chariot & revolving mace wat attached to it.
mahashilakantaka- it was a flexible platform to catapult stone.
ajatshatru was a follower of buddha.
after mahapranirvana (death of buddha), his follower persuaded ajashatru to convene a buddhist council as such 1st buddhist council was convened in 483 bc at rajgriha under patronage of ajatshatru.
two important buddhist texts were compiled in this council i.e 
suttapitaka- original teachings of buddha
vinayapitaks: rules & regulations to be followed by buddhist monks.
ajatshatru decided to shift his capital from rajgriha to patliputra.
udayan: udayan was last important ruler who constructed beautiful city of patliputra.
last ruler, nagadasak was assassinated by his own minister shishunaga.

shishunaga dynasty (412 bc)

shishunaga completely annexed province of avanti & he also shifted capital from patliputra to vaishali.
kalashok (kakvarnin) was last & most important ruler of this dynasty. 
during kalashok's tenure, 2nd buddhist council (383 bc) was convened at vaishali.
assembly was presided by a buddhist monk sabakami.
major development of 2nd council was division of buddhism into 2 sects i.e
sthavirvadin's
mahasanmghika's

nanda dynasty:

kakvarnin was assassinated by a person named mahapadama nanda who founded nanda dynasty in magadh in 344 bc.
mahapdama nanda took a resolve to eliminate all kshatriya from magadh.
because of his aggressive strand, he was also k/a 'ekrat' or 'ugrasena'.
he also annexed kalinga which later became free again.
dhana-nada was most powerful & last ruler of this dynasty.
he went on to create 1 of strongest armies of that time.
greek accounts mention dhana-nanda as 'aggrames'.
at this point in time, ruler of macedonia alexander started his campaign of eastern countries.
in 326 bc, alexander fought with indian ruler of jhelum porous in battle of hydaspes.
alexander defeated porous in this battle but impressed by his bravery, he re-instated porous & made him his ally.
after this, alexander decided to attack magadh but his soldiers warned him of strength of dhana-nanda & requested some time to recuperate & rejuvenate.
as such, alexander paid heed to his army men.
although dhana-nanda was saved from a fight with alexander, he was defeated by chandragupta maurya.

mauryan dynasty (321 bc)

chandragupta was able to defeat dhana-nanda due to active support of vishnugupt, also k/a kautilya or chanakya.
political mechanization devised by kautilya against nanda rulers is mentioned in historical work "mudrarakshak" written by vishakhadhatta.
chandragupta after establishing mauryan empire, in 305 bc fought with greek governor of alexander seleukos nikator.
again, with support of kautilya, chandragupta defeated nikator after which a friendship treaty was signed b/w nikator & c.maurya.
terms & conditions in treaty:
nikator gave area lying west of river indus, sindh, & kabul to chandragupta.
nikator also gave hand of his daughter helina to chandragupta.
chandragupta gifted 500 elephants to nikator.
nikator requested chandragupta to accept a greek ambassador-megasthenes in his court.
in greek accounts, chandragupta is referred to as "sandrocottus"
chandragupta accepted jainism under influence of jaina monk "bhadrabahu".
there was a severe famine in magadh after which chandragupta decided to shift to a place c/a "sharavanbelagola" in karnataka.
