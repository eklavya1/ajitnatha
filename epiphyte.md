epiphyte is an organism dt grows on surface of a plant & derives its moisture & nutrients from air, rain, water (in marine environments) or from debris accumulating around it. plants, on which epiphytes grow, r called phorophytes. Epiphytes take part in nutrient cycles & add to both diversity & biomass of ecosystem in which they occur, like any other organism. They r an important source of food for many species. Typically, older parts of a plant will hv more epiphytes growing on dm. Epiphytes differ from parasites in dt they grow on other plants for physical support & do not necessarily affect host negatively. An organism dt grows on another organism dt is not a plant may be called an epibiont. Epiphytes r usually found in temperate zone (e.g., many mosses, liverworts, lichens, & algae) or in tropics (e.g., many ferns, cacti, orchids, & bromeliads). Epiphyte species make good houseplants due to their minimal water & soil requirements. Epiphytes provide a rich & diverse habitat for other organisms including animals, fungi, bacteria, & myxomycetes.Epiphyte is one of subdivisions of Raunki√¶r system.

term epiphytic derives from Greek epi- (meaning 'upon') & phyton (meaning 'plant'). Epiphytic plants r sometimes called "air plants" because they do not root in soil. However, there r many aquatic species of algae dt r epiphytes on other aquatic plants (seaweeds or aquatic angiosperms).
