vihƒÅra generally refers to a buddhist monastery for buddhist renunciates, mostly in the indian subcontinent. the concept is ancient and in early sanskrit and pali texts, it meant any arrangement of space or facilities for dwellings . the term evolved into an architectural concept wherein it refers to living quarters for monks with an open shared space or courtyard, particularly in buddhism. the term is also found in ajivika, hindu and jain monastic literature, usually referring to temporary refuge for wandering monks or nuns during the annual indian monsoons. in modern jainism, the monks continue to wander from town to town except during the rainy season (chaturmas), and the term "vihara" refers to their wanderings.vihara or vihara hall has a more specific meaning in the architecture of india, especially ancient indian rock-cut architecture. here it means a central hall, with small cells connected to it, sometimes with beds carved from the stone. some have a shrine cell set back at the centre of the back wall, containing a stupa in early examples, or a buddha statue later. typical large sites such as the ajanta caves, aurangabad caves, karli caves, and kanheri caves contain several viharas. some included a chaitya or worship hall nearby. the vihara originated as a shelter for monks when it rains.
