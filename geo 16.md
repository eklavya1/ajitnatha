# summary

geography class 16

a brief recap of previous class

measurement of earthquake.

earthquake waves are recorded by instrument c/a seismograph.
record produced from a seismograph is c/a seismogram.
intensity of earthquake:
it's evaluation of severity of earthquake.
it's a subjective assessment of visible damage caused during earthquake.
it may decrease away from epicenter.
it's measured by modified mercalli scale & it has a range b/w 1 to 12.
magnitude of earthquake:
it's measure of amount of energy released during earthquake.
it's measured by ritcher scale & it has a range of 1 to no upper limit.
it's a logarithmic scale, with each unit being 10 times more in magnitude than previous one. 
effects/impacts of earthquake
loss of life.
infrastructural damages.
floods.
fire accidents.

tsunami

it's a japanese word for harbor waves.
they are also c/a seismic sea waves. 

causes of tsunami generation: 

it's generated due to vertical displacement of a column of seawater. it can be due to: 
earthquakes along normal & reverse fault.
volcanic eruption along with seafloor or coast.
landslides, subsidence along oceanic floor
large meteorite impact in ocean.

stages in existence of a tsunami.

generation:
any reason that is causing vertical displacement of water
propagation in deep waters:
speed of wave will be very high & amplitude will be very low.
therefore, tsunami will not be visible in open ocean & will not cause any damage.
propagation in shallow waters:
as waves approach coast, depth of water decreases, speed of waves also decreases, & amplitude increases.
due to low speed of water, water piles up near coast resulting in generation of very high waves near coast which is c/a  shoaling effect.
landfall.

exogenetic movements

these are earth movements caused due to various forces from outside earth's surface.
source of energy for all exogenic movements are solar energy & gravity.
it involves degradation & aggradation.
aggradation: it involves action of various processes that cause deposition on surfaces in order to bring uniformity of grade.
degradation (or denudation): it's combined action of various processes that cause wearing away of earth's surface & causes a general lowering & leveling out of surface. it involves weathering, transportation, & erosion.

weathering

it's total effect of various processes that cooperate in bringing about decay & disintegration of rocks involving no large-scale transportation. weathering is in-situ & does not involve transportation of degraded rock materials.
factors affecting weathering
rock type & structure: it includes rock massiveness, crystal structure, presence of fractures, bedding plane, porosity, etc. ex: sedimentary rocks are weathered faster than igneous rocks.
slope & aspect: steep slope will greatly aid weathering, as disintegrated material will immediately flow down. slopes which are exposed to wind, rain, & sunlight are more prone to weathering.
temperature: considerable range of temperature both diurnal & annual subjects surface layer to expansion & contraction. temperature also increases rate of chemical reactions.
water: presence of water decides chemical reactions. also, when water is added & removed, it adds mechanical stress on rock & causes a split.
organism: it includes actions of roots of plants, decomposing vegetation, & burrowing animals.

types of weathering

three main types: mechanical (or physical), chemical & biological
difference b/w mechanical & chemical weathering: explained through a table in class
types of mechanical weathering
crystal growth: when water freezes, it expands & finds its way in cracks & pores & wedges apart rock fissures & joints. it's frost shattering in case of arid regions & freeze-thaw in case of glacier regions.
exfoliation: rapid expansion & contraction of surface rocks weaken shell creating fissures causing rock shell to peel off
pressure release: confining pressure from weight of overlying rocks is released. this causes rock to expand leaving development of fractures i.e. pressure release.
block disintegration: where rocks disintegrate as diff blocks
granular disintegration:  where rock is degraded as small granules
