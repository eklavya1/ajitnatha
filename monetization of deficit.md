it involves financing of such extra expenses with money, instead of debt to be
repaid at some future dates. so, it's a form of non-debt financing. as a result, under
monetization, there is no increase in net (not gross) public debt. hence, statement 1 is
correct.
it cn occur only through 1 of 2 modalities:
direct monetization
indirect monetization
## direct monetization (dm)
• under this method, rbi prints new currency & purchases govt bonds directly from primary market (from govemment) using this currency.
• as a result, this supports spending needs of govemment.
## indirect monetization (1m)
• in this method, deficits are monetized as govt issues bonds in primary market & rbi purchases equivalent amount of govt bonds from secondary market in form of open market operations (omo).
monetization of deficit was in practice in india till 1997, whereby central bank automatically monetized govt deficit through issuance of ad-hoc treasury bills.
in 1994 & 1997, 2 agreements were signed b/w govt & rbi to completely phase out funding through ad-hoc treasury bills.
later on, with enactment of fiscal responsibility & budget management (frbm) act, 2003, rbi was completely barred from subscribing to primary issuances of govemment. it was agreed that henceforth, rbi would operate only in secondary market through omo (open market operations) route..
