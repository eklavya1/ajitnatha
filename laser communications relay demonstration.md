NASA has launched its new Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD).
It is the agency's first-ever laser communications system.
The LCRD will help the agency test optical communication in space.

LCRD is a technology demonstration that will pave the way for future optical communications missions.
The LCRD payload is hosted onboard the US Department of Defense's Space Test Program Satellite 6 (STPSat-6).
It will be in a geosynchronous orbit, over 35,000km above Earth.
