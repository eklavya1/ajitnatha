demand-pull inflation exists when aggregate demand for a good or service outstrips aggregate supply.
if aggregate demand rises faster than productive capacity, then firms will respond by putting up prices creating inflation.
it is most common cause of inflation.
causes of demand-pull inflation:
a growing economy:
	when consumers feel confident, they spend more & take on more debt.
	this leads to a steady increase in demand, which means higher prices.
lower interest rates:
	a cut in interest rates causes a rise in consumer spending & higher investment.
	this boost to demand causes a rise in aggregate demand & inflationary pressures.
devaluation in exchange rate increases domestic demand (exports are cheaper, imports are more expensive).
	devaluation will also cause cost-push inflation (imports are more expensive).
government spending:
	when govemment spends more freely, prices go up.
more money in system:
	an expansion of money supply with too few goods to buy make prices increase.
cost-push inflation occurs when overall prices increase (inflation) due to increases in cost of wages & raw materials (inputs).
