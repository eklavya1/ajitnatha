- cabinet is a smaller body consisting of 15 to 25 ministers.
- includes cabinet ministers only. thus, it's a part of council of ministers.
- meets, as a body, frequently & usually once a week to deliberate & take decisions regarding transaction of govt business. thus, it has collective functions.
- it exercises, in practice, powers of council of ministers & thus, acts for latter.
- directs council of ministers by taking policy decisions that are binding on all ministers.
- supervises implementation of its decisions by council of ministers.
- was inserted in article 352 of constitution in 1978 by 44th constitutional amendment act.
- thus, it did not find a place in original text of constitution.
- now also, article 352 only defines cabinet saying that it's council consisting of prime minister & other ministers of cabinet rank appointed under [[a75 Other provisions as to Ministers]] & does not describe its powers & functions.
- in other words, its role in our politico-administrative system is based on conventions of parliamentary govt as developed in britain.
- it enforces collective responsibility of council of ministers to lower house of parliament.

- [44th amendment of indian constitution - indian polity notes](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/44th-amendment-act/)
- any changes in basic structure of constitution cn be made only if they are approved by people of india by a majority of votes at a referendum in which at least fifty-one per cent of electorate participated. article 368 is being amended to ensure this.

- 44th amendment act of 1978 reversed provision made by 42nd amendment act that allowed govt to amend constitution on its wish by article 368. 44th amendment act nullified this unjustified power to govt.

- *right to property was removed* from list of fundamental rights (article 31) & was made a legal right under article 300a.

- *proclamation of emergency cn be issued only when security of india or any part of its territory is threatened by war or external aggression or by armed rebellion*. internal disturbance [[indira gandhi]] not amounting to armed rebellion would not be a ground for issue of a proclamation.

- *an emergency cn be proclaimed only on basis of written advice tendered to president by cabinet.*

- right to liberty is further strengthened by provision that law for preventive detention cannot authorise, in any case, detention for a longer period than 3 months, unless advisory board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention.

- right of media to report freely & without censorship proceedings in parliament & state legislatures.
