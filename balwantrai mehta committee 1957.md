### recommendations
1. establishment of a three-tier panchayati rajsystem – gram panchayat at village level, panchayat samiti at block level & zila parishad at district level. these tiers should be organically linked through a device of indirect elections.
2. village panchayat should be constituted with directly elected representatives, whereas panchayat samiti & zila parishad should be constituted with indirectly elected members.
3. all planning & development activities should be entrusted to these bodies.
4. panchayat samiti should be executive body while zila parishad should be advisory, coordinating & supervisory body.
5. district collector should be chairman of zila parishad.
6. there should be a genuine transfer of power & responsibility to these democratice bodies.
7. adequate resources should be transferred to these bodies to enable them to discharge their functions & fulfil their responsibilities.
8. a system should be evolved to effect further devolution of authority in future.
