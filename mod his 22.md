3. census- brits 开 census 里 印度 , 比如- census 的 [[1872]] revealed was that muslims formed 20% 的 印度 人口 , 里 [[punjab]], 他们 were 里 多数, 和 roughly half 的 bengal 人口. 里 census, 印度 人 had to mention their religion + brits published [[statistics]] on education 和 employment , religion wise, 这↑a sense of belonging to a religious community at an 都 印度 level + deprivation- muslim 有 low share 里 education 和 employment, 最多 were poor peasants

					- the upper caste hindu gentry wanted to maintain its dominance after british withdrawal from india, sensing this muslim bloc had to take relevant countermeasures. also before british arrival, muslims were the de facto and de jure rulers and now they had found themselves to be a numerical as well as administrative minority. so this fear must have added fuel to fire

Additional Details regarding Swadeshi Movement (1905-11)
## Swadesh Bandhab Samiti
- led by AK Dutt.
- Engaged in Constructive Swadeshi for mobilising the masses in favor of Swadeshi Movement by engaging them in following activities:
	- Lantern lectures; Songs & Poetry; Physical & Moral Training (*in line with focus on physical training of Swami [[Vivekananda]]); Social Work like famine relief for those affected by hunger; [[Organisation]] of schools; training in Swadeshi crafts; and organisation of Arbitration Courts for swadeshi dispute resolution.

## Barisal Samiti
- It held Barisal Conference in 1906 where Surendranath Bannerjea and [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] distributed badges of Bande Mataram. The police suppressed it before the procession could begin. Barisal Samiti worked among the poor muslim peasants. Thus, efforts were made to engage muslim peasants.

Revolutionary Terrorism
## Barrah Dacoity 1908
- a swadeshi dacoity in [[Dhaka]], East by Dacca Anushilan Samiti under Pulin Behari Das where residence of Zamihdar of Barrah was looted.

## Alipore Conspiracy Case
- a failed attempt at life of Magistrate Kingsford by Prafulla Chaki and Khudiram Bose during which two english [[women]] were killed instead.
 - This led to many arrests including of [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] who was defended by CR Das in court. On acquittal Aurobindo shifted away from Indian National Movement to pursue spiritualism.
- Tilak in his publication Kesari condemned the violence, however, defended the two men on grounds that the British should understand that oppression would ultimately lead to violence. He was charged on grounds of [[sedition]] and imprisoned for 6 years in Mandalay, [[Burma]]. It was [[Jinnah]] who defended him in the court.

## Nasik Conspiracy Case
- District Magistrate Jackson was shot at by Kanhere. In [[1910]], Vinayak Savarkar was deported to Andaman for life.

> The following conspiracy casæ are not part of the Swadeshi Movement and thus are listed to prevent confusion in Prelims examination:

## Delhi Conspiracy Case 1912

 - It was a failed assassination attempt against Viceroy Hardinge ([[1910]]-1916) in Delhi planned by [[Rash Behari Bose]] on occasion of a ceremony on account of transfer of capital to Delhi from Bengal.
- [[Rash Behari Bose]] evaded arrest till 1915 and then escaped to Japan where later he would be instrumental in initiation of the INA.

## Meerut Conspiracy Case 1929
- This case was a ploy by the government to crack dqwn on the communist leaders like S.A. Dange who were arrested and tried teetheir communist revolutionary activities (specifically on charges of attacking د sovereignty of the crown).
 - The communists at that time were engaged in inciting strikes in railways and a conspiracy to setup a branch of Zomintern in India. [[comintern]] was an [[organisation]] with headquarters in USSR having goal of  spread of the communist revolution.
- The trial increased the popularity of the Communist Party of India ([[CPI]]) as the communists used the courtroom as a platform for their propaganda.

## Lahore Conspiracy Case 1928
- Here the British Police officer John Saunders was mistakenly shot dead by Bhagat Singh in December 1928. The real target was James Scott who had personally assaulted Lala Lajpat Rai during anti-Simon [[Commission]] protests. The Sher-e-[[Punjab]] died due to injuries in November, 1928.
- [[Bhagat Singh]], Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged after trial in 1931 while Chandrashekhar Azad was killed in an encounter the same year.
