- **marble** is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite.
- Marble is typically not foliated, although there are exceptions. In [[geology]], the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone, but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone.
- Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material.
