it's organic polymers that conduct electricity. such compounds may have metallic conductivity equal to metals or semiconductors.
it cn offer high electrical conductivity but does not show similar mechanical properties to other commercially available polymers.
biggest advantage of conductive polymers is their processability, mainly by dispersion.
an indian scientist, mrinal thakur has been nominated for 2003 nobel prize in chemistry for his discovery of non-conjugated conductive polymers
two americans — alan heeger & alan macdiarmid — & a japanese, hideki shirakawa, won chemistry nobel in 2000 for their discovery of conductive polymers
recent development
new nanostructured forms of conducting polymers particularly, augment this field with their higher surface area & better dispersibility.
## applications
specially designed organic polymer cn emit light when electric current is passed through then so they have been incorporated into commercial displays & batteries eg. oled tv.
these photodiodes are more energy-saving & generate less heat than light bulbs also flexible displays cn be made using them.
they are also promising in organic solar cells, printing electronic circuits, actuators, supercapacitors, chemical sensors & biosensors, flexible transparent displays,
electromagnetic shielding, & possible replacement for popular transparent conductor indium tin oxide.
eg. polyaniline is widely used for printed circuit board manufacturing — in final finish, for protecting copper from corrosion & preventing its solderability
it's also used on computer screens, protecting user from electromagnetic radiation, & as a corrosion inhibitor
another use is for microwave-absorbent coatings, particularly radar-absorptive coatings on stealth aircraft.
## limitations
there have had limitations due to manufacturing costs, material inconsistencies, toxicity, poor solubility in solvents, & inability to directly melt process.
