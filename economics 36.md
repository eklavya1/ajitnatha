a brief overview of previous class & on other relevant topics - 09.08 am
## govt budgeting
09.26 am
- budgeting techniques have evolved over period of [[time]] to become more meaningful than merely accounting for [[future]].
- in modern [[time]]s, budgeting is not just about keeping record of expenses or planning for their efficiency. it's more concerned with attainment of outcomes.
- outcome budgeting is implemented through various methods, amongst them, foll are relevant in [[india]]n context. 
### zero-based budgeting (zbb)
- gb refers to method of budgeting in which each [[expenditure]] by govt is re-analyzed everywhere before fresh allocation is made.
	- merely b/c some schemes had allocated expense in previous year does not make it eligible for fresh allocation in present year.
- it will be assessed on its performance with respect to prera]]vious year's [[expenditure]] & expected outcomes before being approved again.
### gender budgeting (gb)
- it's not merely separate allocation on basis of gender. rather, GB is analytical exercise carried out to assess diffial impact that any [[expenditure]] or scheme will have on diff genders.
- it's gender incorporative analysis of budgetary allocations.
- for ex - when govt allocates some [[budget]] for improvement of law & order, it's analyzed how much impact will it have on improvement of safety of women (∴ gender-specific allocations become just 1 part of gender budgeting).

### [[expenditure]] function
- govt incurs expense to perform its sovereign duties which include [[expenditure]] for improvement of welfare of people at bottom.
via [[[[expenditure]]]], govt intends to provide public goods. 
### taxation function
- through taxation, [[government]] intends to collect revenue to provide those public goods & it does so in manner that redistribution of [[wealth]] 
takes place in [[society]].
### stabilization function
- govt has multiple macroeconomic targets to be met such as reduction in [[unemployment]] & control of prices.
- via its policies of [[expenditure]] & taxation, it tries to achieve these macroeconomic objectives. 
## growth & investment models
09.46 am
- these are broad ways to achieve objectives of govt budget.
- investment models include specificity within growth models. it talks about how diff objectives are achieved.
- in investment models, govt decides how & where to spend money in order to perform its responsibilities. 
### theoretical models of investment
#pneumonic *rlh*
1. rostow model
2. lewis model
3. harrod-domar model

#### rostow model
[[rostow model]]
- it simply talks about [[investment]] in highly productive sectors but did not mention any place for specific sectors for [[production]].
- [[economy]] goes through 5 stages of growth -
1. initial agrarian society,
2. development of basic services such as [[transportation]] that will lead to more innovation & industries
3. preconditions to take off,
4. take-off for [[growth]] that is [[economy]] is growing at much faster pace,
5. drive to maturity, [[age]] of high [[consumption]]. [[peter zeihan]] [[george friedman]]
#### lewis model
[[lewis model]]
- it's simply based on assumption of unlimited supply of [[labor]].
- ∴, wages would be low & hence [[country]] must invest in [[labor]]-intensive [[industry]] rather than [[capital]]-intensive industry so that it can exploit its competitive advantage. 
- [[premature deindustrialization]]- reason for this is that output produced with mix of labor & capital is not optimal. in this, less output will be produced & some other country will replace & take over by applying this optimal mix. industry in country will decline *before reaching its optimum level of output.* 
#### harrod-domar model
- [[harrod-domar model]]
- it's based on improvement in [[investment]] & [[saving]]s. it tells that country will grow fast when there are more [[saving]]s, from those savings country must invest & all investments must be efficient.
	[[laos]]hi shuo - [[india]] at [[time]] of [[independence]] had people with no savings so [[government]] had to step in to provide capital for [[investment]]

[[incremental capital output ratio]] (ICOR) must be as low as possible. ∴, it talks about savings, investments, & ICOR.
it was applied in [[india]] through nehru-mahalanobis model along with some modifications b/c [[india]] had no savings from public & hence [[money]] of govt was used for [[investment]] in manner that ICOR is reduced.
now, investment of govt is channelized through ppp (public-private partnership) mode in modern [[time]]s. [[=entrepreneurial state book]]
