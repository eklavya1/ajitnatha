Faizabad (Hindustani pronunciation: [fɛːzaːbaːd]) is a city in the Faizabad district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which forms a municipal corporation with the city of Ayodhya. It was the headquarters of Faizabad district and Faizabad division until 6 November 2018, when the Uttar Pradesh cabinet headed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath approved the renaming of Faizabad district as Ayodhya.  Faizabad is situated on the banks of river Saryu about 130 km east of state capital Lucknow. It was the first capital of the Nawabs of Awadh and has monuments built by the Nawabs, like the Tomb of Bahu Begum, Gulab Bari.
