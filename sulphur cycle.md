[[sulphur]] is one of most abundant elements on earth. It is a yellow, brittle, tasteless, odourless non-metal. Sulphur is present in all kinds of proteins. Plants directly absorb sulphur-containing amino acids such as methionine, cystine, & cysteine.
Sulphur is released into atmosphere by burning of fossil fuels, volcanic activities, & decomposition of organic molecules.
On land, sulphur is stored in underground rocks & minerals. It is released by [[precipitation]], [[weathering]] of [[rock]]s & geothermal vents.

sulfur cycle is a biogeochemical cycle in which sulfur moves between rocks, waterways & living systems. It is important in [[geology]] as it affects many minerals & in life because sulfur is an essential element (CHNOPS), being a constituent of many [[protein]]s & cofactors, & sulfur compounds can be used as oxidants or reductants in microbial respiration. global sulfur cycle involves transformations of sulfur species through different oxidation states, which play an important role in both geological & biological processes.

Steps of sulfur cycle are:

Mineralization of organic sulfur into inorganic forms, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), elemental sulfur, as well as sulfide minerals.

Oxidation of hydrogen sulfide, sulfide, & elemental sulfur (S) to sulfate (SO2−4).

Reduction of sulfate to sulfide.

Incorporation of sulfide into organic compounds (including metal-containing derivatives).These are often termed as follows:

Assimilative sulfate reduction (see also sulfur assimilation) in which sulfate (SO2−4) is reduced by plants, fungi & various prokaryotes. oxidation states of sulfur are +6 in sulfate & –2 in R–SH.

Desulfurization in which organic molecules containing sulfur can be desulfurized, producing hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S, oxidation state = –2). An analogous process for organic nitrogen compounds is deamination.

Oxidation of hydrogen sulfide produces elemental sulfur (S8), oxidation state = 0. This reaction occurs in photosynthetic green & purple sulfur bacteria & some chemolithotrophs.  Often elemental sulfur is stored as polysulfides.

Oxidation in elemental sulfur by sulfur oxidizers produces sulfate.

Dissimilative sulfur reduction in which elemental sulfur can be reduced to hydrogen sulfide.

Dissimilative sulfate reduction in which sulfate reducers generate hydrogen sulfide from sulfate.
