Diphtheria is a serious infection caused by strains of bacteria called Corynebacterium diphtheria that make toxins (poison). It can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, and even death.
The diphtheria toxin causes inflammation of heart muscle (myocarditis) and this can lead to death if not treated with Diptheria antitoxin and proper antibiotics.
Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease â€” the toxoid vaccine elicits an immune response against the toxin which is encoded by a tox gene of the pathogen.
The increasing diversity of the bacterium species, the emergence of variant toxin genes and the progression of antimicrobial resistance may lead to an increase in the incidence of diphtheria.
