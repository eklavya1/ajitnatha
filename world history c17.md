socialism in china: (13:04)

first phase: 1949-58: 

ussr like policies: 
heavy industries.
five-year plans.
collectivization (persuasion).
had great results.
100 flowers campaign results: 
demand fr capitalistic measures like ussr.
complaints, indiscipline of party, etc.
cadres by managers (workers).
mao realizes & implements: 
focus on heavy industries.
communism is still nt secure, 
and ussr model threatens communism.
mao zedong criticized ussr fr revisionism. 
that is revising basic principles of marxism to suit own needs. 
as ussr _ nikita 1953, introduced capitalist measures & nikita talked about peaceful coexistence with capitalist west. 
now ussr stopped giving aid to china. 
and rivalry b/w ussr & china began fr leadership of communist world. 
and finally, in 1971, china aligned with us against ussr. 
and in return, it was allowed to take unsc seat by us.
which, until now was disputed b/w mainland communist china & govt in exile in taiwan (1947-1971, china seat was vacant).

great leap forward, 1958 (13:23)

essence: agrarian socialism.
gradual industrialization.
focus on agriculture.
light industry was focused.
decentralization of industrialization.
6 lakh backyard steel furnaces.
commune in china had about 75000 people.
hence bigger land, mr number of people.
they created a structure, hierarchy, etc.
it had elements of democratic socialism.
above were focus areas of plan of great leap forward (glf).
commune was innovation of glf.
it was bigger than a collective wch had roughly 1500-2000 people, while commune had 75000 people. 
each commune was allocated 30 to 40 technicians, plus some doctors & some party cadres. 
idea was dt commune wd act as a unit of local self-govt.
therefore bringing element of democratic socialism, i.e. decentralization of power to grassroot level.
commune wd schools, set up creches, set up small hospitals/primary healthcare centers, & develop small infrastructure projects like roads, small irrigation systems, etc.
impact of glf: 
in a short time, there were negatives, as 1st sub-point. 
due to reduced focus, on industrialization, gdp growth suffered. 
end of private property due to collectivization & communes took away incentives fm peasants, wch hurt agricultural production, i.e. lack of profit motive hurt agricultural growth.
it takes years & even decades, e.g. only by 1937, 90% of land was collectivized in ussr).
also due to geographical factors, there were bad harvests in short term. 
ds led to great famine of 1959. 

long-term effects of great leap forward: (13:54)

however, in long term, there were positives of glf: 
china had largest population & yet it was able to better deal with challenge of unemployment due to its focus on labour-intensive industry & agriculture.
in long term, there were no major famines in china.
as glf focused on agriculture sector. 
focused on light industry prevented light industry shortages. 
and it contributed positively to standard of living (in ussr it was opposite).
rural masses felt empowered in china due to local self-governance func of communes.
there was no mass migration fm rural to urban areas. 
as was case in other countries wch underwent industrialization. 
ds is because, focus wasn't on rapid & heavy industrialization, wch is urban-centric.
agriculture has mr roles fr women, & therefore, women enjoyed better status (educated & employed).
rural masses had access to basic services, & they were educated & employed.
in long term, dt is by 1976, china was able to develop a decent heavy industry via gradual industrialization.
for ex, it had a strong machine-building industry, a good steel sector, a good oil industry, & a base fr being a nuclear power.

cultural revolution (1966-69) 14:07 

what? use of force to keep glf on marxist lines.
why? short-term negatives of great leap forward. opposition to mao increased.
due to short-term failures of glf, opposition to mao within ccp increased.
and pressure was built on him to change basic aspects of glf.
cultural revolution was mao’s response to his critics. 
mao & gang of 4 (supporters of mao, led by mao’s wife) gave a call to party cadre & students to go to masses & campaign in favour of mao.
and argue in favour of glf.
therefore it was a propaganda campaign to keep glf on marxist lines. 
political opponents within ccp were suppressed. 
for ex, deng xiaoping was sent to countryside fr 4 years, & his son was tortured.
supporters of mao soon went out of control as they attacked violently anyone who disagreed with their campaign. 
and soon there was widespread violence & loot. 
finally, in 1969, mao had to withdraw fm cultural revolution. 
many were arrested & punished. 
mao was cleared of all blame.
economy suffered, however, mao was able to keep glf on marxist lines. 
therefore maoism survived in china.

deng xiaoping: 14:24 

market socialism: it means market/capitalism in economy; & socialism in polity (ccp).
idea of socialism in market:
profits of psus & tax revenue are shared with poor sections.
ability to do this: monopoly in political sphere.

reformes by deng xiaoping: (15:07)

sent specialists to singapore, to study sezs.
in 1980s: sezs were op nd where chinese cd open pvt. companies.
china joined imf, & world bank in 1980s. 
import of modern equipment happened.
1978: family businesses were allowed. 

profit motive: (15:15)

bonus, piece wage rates, profit-sharing schemes, etc. 
financing, planning, etc, were decentralized & given to communes. 
more money to communes fr state procurement was given.
tax rates on communes were lowered. 

reforms (1984):

agricultural reforms: 

communes were broken, & ownership remained _ collective control.
end to state being only buyers of produce.
end to administered prices of agricultural commodities.

industry (reforms): 15:27 

privatization of some unavailable psus.
psu operation _ market competition. 
1990: shanghai stock exchange was opened.
company law allowed diff types of companies (1993).
gradually psus removed their dependence on state budget fr their financing & become self-sufficient. 
bank loans: 
till mid-90s, most loans were taken by psus, however, loans to pvt. sectors were given later on, wch reflected creditworthiness of private companies.
in 2001 china joined wto: & agreed to follow international rules of trade.

market socialism: (15:37)

focus on market socialism on private growth, high taxes, & use of ds post-growth.
proceeds fr social goods. 
management: laws allow chinese govt to take a greater role in management of private companies.
call fr nationalization: 
left wingers (2018) demand end of private companies as capitalism has served its purpose of delivering growth. 
call fr democratic socialism: as private companies grow as some argue fr joint management by workers & employees.

why one-party system survived in china? (15:44)

what exists in china today is nt socialism, bt a one-party system in polity & capitalism in economy. 
with state being a dominant player in economy. 
in 1989, communism failed in eastern europe & ussr bt it survived in china (which is a one-party system). 

leadership of deng xiaoping: (15:47)

deng was clear about his commitment to ops (a one-party system).
democracy wall 1978: 
after 1976, struggle in ccp fr power, plus, supporters of deng began posting messages on walls in diff cities. 
plus, in 1978, all these walls were demolished except 1 in beijing, home constituency of deng.
plus, now messages became mr radical, demanding democratic reforms. 
deng cracked down hard on his own supporters & md clear his commitment to ops.
on other hand, mikhail gorbachev wasn't dt committed to one-party system. 
in 1989, tienanmen square: 
gorbachev was on a state visit to china, & thousands of protestors had gathered demanding democratic reforms.
and, deng felt insulted & whole world expected dt communism wd fall in china, as it was falling elsewhere. 
puls, deng again cracked down hard & deployed army.
it was a turning point & deng’s actions ensured survival of ops in china, while ussr disintegrated.
deng was a much mr effective leader & efficiently balanced left & right-wing as compared to gorbachev.
also, there was no opponent like boris yeltsin. 
china was ethnically homogenous. 
while mr than 47% population in russia was ethnically diff. 
which increased political tensions in ussr.
somehow china did reforms in a periodic manner. 
and chinese communism proved to be mr flexible to change. 
1949-1958: focus on industrialization & collectivization.
plus, 1958 to 1976: glf, with a focus on agriculture & rural development. 
1976 onwards capitalism. 
whereas ussr began reforms properly only in 1985, wch was too late. 
china was able to ensure food security, employment, & basic services, & gradually improve its standards of living. 
plus, lsg func of communes empowered rural masses. 
china wasn't _ pressure of leading cold war against us & its allies. 
and therefore, its economy wasn't drained on account of cold war. 

topic fr next class is: cold war.
