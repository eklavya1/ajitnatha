kangchenjunga, also spelt kanchenjunga and khangchendzonga, is the **third highest mountain in the world**. its summit lies at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) in a section of the [[himalaya]]s, the kangchenjunga himal, which is bounded on the west by the tamur river, in the north by the lhonak chu and jongsang la, and in the east by the teesta river. it lies in the border region between the sikkim state of [[india]] and [[nepal]], with three of the five peaks, namely main, central and south, directly on the border, and the peaks west and kangbachen in nepal's taplejung district.until 1852, kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the great trigonometrical survey of india in [[1849]] showed that mount everest, known as peak xv at the time, is the highest. allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that kangchenjunga is the third highest mountain.kangchenjunga was first climbed on 25 may [[1955]] by joe brown and george band, who were part of the 1955 british kangchenjunga expedition. they stopped short of the summit following the promise given to the chogyal of sikkim that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate. the mountain is off-limit to climbers from the indian side. in 2016, the adjoining khangchendzonga national park was declared a [[unesco]] world heritage site.
