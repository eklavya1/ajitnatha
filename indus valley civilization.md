The Indus people sowed seed in the flood plains in November, when the floodwater receded, & reaped their harvest of wheat and barley in April, before the advent of the next flood. They produced wheat, barley, rice, peas, sesame, mustard and rice.
Foodgrains were stored in huge granaries in both Mohenjodaro and Harappa. Probably, cereals were received as taxes from peasants and stored in granaries for the payment of wages as well as use during emergencies.
No hoe or ploughshare has been discovered, but the furrows discovered in the pre-Harappan phase at kalibangan show that the fields were ploughed in Rajasthan in the Harappan period. The Harappans probably used the wooden ploughshare.
We do not know whether the plough was drawn by men or oxen. Stone sickles may have been used for harvesting the crops.
The Indus people were the earliest people to produce [[cotton]].
Because cotton was first produced in this area the Greeks called it - [[sindon]], which is derived from Sindh.
Ragi or finger millet is not known so far to any of the Harappan sites in north India.

It marks the beginning of the history of India.
It flourished around 2500 years ago in the westem part of Asia which comes in contemporary Pakistan and Western India.
It is also known as the Harappan Civilization because Harappa was the first site to be excavated in 1921 under the supervision of Daya Ram Sahni.
The known extent of IVC is up to Suktagendor in Baluchistan in the west; Alamgirpur (UP) in the east; Daimabad (Maharashtra) in the South; and Manda (Jammu & Kashmir) in the north.
It is the home to the largest of the four of its contemporary urban civilizations namely Mesopotamian or Sumerian Civilization, Egyptian Civilization, and Chinese Civilization.
While Indus Valley Civilization is on the banks of Indus, Egyptian Civilization flourished on the banks of the river Nile, Mesopotamian Civilization flourished on the banks of Tigris or Euphrates river and Chinese Civilization flourished on the banks of Hwang Ho river.
Since it belongs to the Bronze/Chalcolithic age, it is also known as the Bronze Age Civilization.
In the 1920s, the excavations were carried out in the Indus Valley regions, where ruins of the old cities were found. The first city to be unearthed was Harappa.
In 1924, John Marshall, the then Director-General of the Department of Archaeology announced the discovery of the Indus Valley Civilization.
Town planning is the most important and distinguishing feature of the Harappan Civilization. Hence, it was called an urban civilization.
Towns were divided into parts namely citadel and lower town. Citadels were occupied by members of the ruling class and the lower town was inhabited by the common people.
Another important feature of IVC is the drainage system. Drains were built of burnt bricks and covered by stone lids.
Chanhudaro is an archaeological site belonging to the post-urban Jhukar phase of the Indus valley civilization. It was the only Indus city without a citadel.
