In September 2021 , the Union Cabinet approved the Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman or PM-POSHAN for providing one hot cooked meal in Govemment and Govemment-aided schools with a financial outlay of Rs 1.31 trillion.
The scheme replaced the national programme for mid-day meals in schools or Mid-day Meal Scheme.
It has been launched for an initial period of five years (2021-22 to 2025-26).
Primary (1-5) and upper primary (6-8) schoolchildren are currently entitled to 100 grams and 150 grams of food grains per working day each, to ensure a minimum of 700 calories.
It also covers students of balvatikas (children in the 3-5 year age group) from pre-primary classes.
The scheme has a provision for supplementary nutrition for children in aspirational districts and those with a high prevalence of anaemia.
It does away with the restriction on the part of the Centre to provide funds only for wheat, rice, pulses and vegetables.
Tithi Bhojan is a community participation programme in which people provide special food to children on special occasions/festivals.
