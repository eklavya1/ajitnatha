The outlawed Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) has claimed responsibility for the recent low-intensity IED blast

The HNLC, which demands a sovereign Khasi homeland in Meghalaya, is a breakaway faction of the Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council (HALC), the first militant tribal outfit of the state, formed in the mid-1980s.
*'Hynniewtrep' refers to the Khasi and Jaintia communities, and 'Achik' to the Garo community.*
The HNLC is seen as representative of Khasi identity and pride, and most of the top leadership is based out of Bangladesh.

The Khasi people are an ethnic group of Meghalaya in north-eastern India with a significant population in the bordering state of Assam, and in certain parts of Bangladesh. The Khasi people form the majority of the population of the eastern part of Meghalaya, and is the state's largest community, with around 48% of the population of Meghalaya. They are among the few Austroasiatic-speaking peoples in South Asia. A cultural tradition of the Khasi people is that they follow the matrilineal system. Under the Constitution of India, the Khasis have been granted the status of [[Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribe]].
