[[polity 09|sc]] ([[1948]]) - linguistic commission post independeence- to study reorganization 国 on a linguistic basis


jvp committee 的 د congress


# **dhar commission** 
there was a demand from diff regions, mainly [[south india]], for reorganization of states on linguistic basis. consequently, in june 1948, govt of [[india]] appointed linguistic provinces commission under chairmanship of s.k.dhar to study feasibility of organizing states on linguistic basis.

commission, later on, rejected linguistic basis of reorganization of states & recommended reorganization of states on basis of foll criterias :
1. geographical contiguity
2. financial self-reliance
3. administrative viability
4. potential for development 

# jvp committee 
(jawaharlal nehru, vallahbhai patel, pattabhi sitaramayya)
report submitted by dhar commission led to much resentment among people. as a result, in jaipur session of 1948, congress appointed a 3 member committee to consider recommendations of dhar commission. this committee also rejected linguistic factor of reorganization of states. *this committee recommended reorganization of states on basis of security, unity & economic prosperity of nation.*

however, indian govt was forced by death of [[potti sriramulu]] to create 1st linguistic state, k/a andhra state, by separating telugu speaking areas from madras state. potti sriramulu became famous for undertaking hunger strike in support of formation of indian state for telugu-speaking population of madras presidency; he lost his life in process. his death sparked public rioting, & indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru declared intent to form andhra state 3 days following.

why linguistic criteria was rejected by dhar commission & jvp committee-
- may have promoted secession/breaking up of india
- hindrance to national unity [[george friedman]] [[superpower]]
- might have promoted parochial interests
