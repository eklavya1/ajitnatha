	- Radioisotopes decay at a constant rate, the time required for original Isotopes to reduce to its half is called the half-life
	- Every living organism has both (C-12 and C-14 ) in them. C-14 being unstable goes for beta decay
	- This decay is compensated by the nutrition of the organism because of which the C-12 to C14 ratio mirrors the environmental level. But when organisms die this ratio is no longer the same.
	- This difference is exploited by the researchers to know the age of fossil
	- Asked in Upsc 2008 - Radioactivity is measured by Geiger-Muller; Semiconductor device, scintillation #pre
