fog is a cloud of small water droplets that is near ground level & sufficiently dense to reduce horizontal visibility to less than 1,000 metres (3,281 feet).
when temperature of air mass containing a large quantity of water vapour falls all of a sudden, condensation takes place within itself 
on fine dust particles.
so, fog is a cloud with its base at or very near to ground.
 b/c of fog & mist, visibility becomes poor to zero.
fog is forrned by condensation of water vapour on condensation nuclei that are always present in natural air.
this results as soon as relative humidity of air exceeds saturation by a fraction of 1%.
in highly polluted air nuclei may grow sufficiently to cause fog at humidities of 95% or less.
in urban & industrial centres smoke provides plenty of nuclei which help formation of fog & mist. hence, option 2 is correct answer.
such a condition when fog is mixed with smoke is described as smog.
growth of drops may be helped by absorption of certain soluble gases, notably sulfur dioxide to form dilute sulfuric acid.
only difference b/w mist & fog is that mist contains more moisture than fog.
in mist, each nuclei contains a thicker layer of moisture.
mists are frequent over mountains as rising warm air up slopes meets a cold surface.
fogs are drier than mist & they are prevalent where warm currents of air come in contact with cold currents.
fogs are therefore, mini clouds in which condensation takes place around nuclei provided by dust, smoke, & salt particles.

	- when [[warm oceanic currents]] meets [[cold oceanic currents]], it leads to fog formation ---> harmful for sea traffic ---> [[titanic]] [[tragedy]] happened in this area cuz of fog
	- [[fish bank]] are found in large numbers where cold & warm [[oceanic currents]] meet
