Dalton's law (also called Dalton's law of partial pressures) states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total  pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. This empirical law was observed by John Dalton in 1801 and published in 1802. Dalton's law is related to the ideal gas laws.
