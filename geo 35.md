* exception - along [[kerala]] coast , it's emergent as opposed to submergent coast of entire western coastal plains
* indicator of emergent coast - presence of `sandbars`

# drainage system of india
- æ™‚ - `04:48 pm 18/8/2021`
## evolution of himalayan drainage
- widely accepted theory regarding himalayan drainage proposes existence of a single [[river]] all along entire stretch of himalayas flowing from east to west c/a as  `indo-brahm` or [[shivalik river]] or [[tethys river]]  (not sea !) which drained into [[gulf of sindh]]
## himalayan drainage
- this earlier drainage system was `disturbed` by 3 main events
	1. more rising of western himalayas
	2. upliftment of [[potwar plateau]] & [[delhi ridge]]
	3. downthrusting of [[malda gap]] _05:18 pm 18/8/2021_
- this divided entire river into 3 `tier systems` ie
	1. indus & its tributaries
	2. ganga & its tributaries
	3. brahmaputra & its tributaries
## evolution of peninsular drainage
- æ™‚ - `05:39 pm 18/8/2021`
- it's influenced by 3 major events
	1. submergence of western part of peninsula which disturbed symmetrical pattern of [[river]]s
	2. upliftment of [[himalaya]] which caused northern part of [[vindhyan range]] to tilt towards north & formation of rift valleys of [[narmada river]] & [[tapi river]]
	3. gradual tilting of peninsular block to southeast direction causing slope towards [[bay of bengal]] drainage
- differences b/w himalayan & peninsular drainage systems
