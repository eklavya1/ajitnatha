- • Direct seeding of [[rice]] refers to the process of establishing a [[rice]] crop from seeds sown in the field rather than by transplanting seedlings from the nursery. 
 - • Unlike conventional transplanting, in DSR, there is no nursery preparation or transplantation and the seeds are instead directly drilled into the field by a tractor-powered machine.
 - • Advantages of Direct Seeding of [[Rice]] technique:
	 - ◦ Saving in water up to 25%.
	 - ◦ Enhanced fertilizer use [[efficiency]] due to the placement of fertilizer in the root zone.
	 - ◦ Early maturity of crops by 7-10 days helps in timely sowing of succeeding crops.
	 - ◦ Reduction in methane emissions and global warming potential.
	 - ◦ Little disturbance to soil structure.
	 - ◦ Enhanced system [[productivity]].
	 - ◦ About three labourers are required to transplant one acre of paddy in a single day. Since transplanting is not required in DSR, this reduces labour costs.
 - • Disadvantages:
	 - ◦ Non-availability of herbicides.
	 - ◦ The seed requirement for DSR is also high, 8-10 kg/acre, compared to 4-5 kg/acre in transplanting.
	 - ◦ The laser land levelling is compulsory in DSR which is not so in transplanting.
	 - ◦ The sowing needs to be done timely so that the plants have come out properly before the monsoon rains arrive.
