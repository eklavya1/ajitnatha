Presidency University, Kolkata, formerly known as Hindu College and Presidency College, is a public state university located in College Street, Kolkata.
Established in [[1817]], it is probably the oldest institution in India to have no religious connection.
The establishment of the Hindu College in 1817 was a major event in the history of Bengal.
It played an important role in carrying forward the reformist movement that had already emerged in the province.
A radical movement for the reform of Hindu Society, known as the Young Bengal Movement, started in the college.
