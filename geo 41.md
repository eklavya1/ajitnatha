agriculture in india(1.16 pm)

# land use categories in india:
there are 4 categories of agriculture usage & 4 of non-agriculture usages.
## non-agricultural uses:
[[forest]] land: land covered with forest.
settlements: where human being lives & works.
barren & wastelands: land that cannot be brought under cultivation with presently available [[technology]]. like ravines, [[desert]] areas, etc.
permanent pasture & tree crops: land used for grazing.
## agricultural uses:
- net sown area: this represents total area that is under cultivation in any particular year. area sowed more than once in same year is counted only once.
- gross cropped area: total area under cultivation where area which is sown multiple times is counted multiple times.
- current fallow: land that has left fallow(uncultivated) for less than 1 year.
- follow other than current fallow: left fallow for 1 year to less than 5 years.
- culturable wastelands: cultivable but left fallow for more than 5 years.
- trends in land use:
- areas in decreasing order of use: net sowed forest>forest>area in non-agriculture use>barren & wasteland.
- forest area has increased, net sown area has increased slightly, area in non-agriculture area has increased & current fallow has also increased.
- area under barren & wasteland has decreased, pasture land has decreased & culturable fallow other than current fallow has also decreased. 
- cropping intensity= (gross cropped area/net sown area)x100. #todo 
# green revolution
- (1.41 pm)
- revolution in indian agriculture for high productivity.
- before independence [[agriculture]] was completely neglected. thus there was low [[production]] & [[productivity]].
- after [[independence]], there was increase in population creating a shortage of food crops.
- basic idea of green revolution started in `3rd fyp`.
- it was carried out in diff phases but overall same methodologies were used.
- various input used:
- *high yield variety(hyv) of seed*:

*advantages*:
it grows faster: takes less time to attain maturity.
it grows as short bushes.
it grows more densely that increases productivity. that is per plant output is higher.

*requirements*(inputs):
a regular supply of water through [[irrigation]].
it also requires a regular power supply for irrigation.
it also requires regular use of chemical fertilizers.
they are more prone to pests thus regular use of pesticides is required.
captial to buy these inputs. this was provided by govt also.
msp for assured price was provided by govts.

phases:

`1st phase(1961-1968):`
it was experimental phase.
integrated agriculture development program: it was introduced in 8 districts of [[punjab]] & [[haryana]].
output was doubled in these districts.

`2nd phase(1968-1981):`
extended to entire state of haryana, punjab, & western up.
mainly in plain areas with easy availability of irrigation & capital.
production increased from 66 mt to 150 mt in these states.
mainly wheat crop was targeted in this phase.

`3rd phase(1981-1992):`
it targeted rice-growing states like west bengal, tamil naidu, & delta regions of krishna, godavari, mahanadi, etc.
production of rice was doubled.
implications:

positive:
	self sufficiently in food grains.
negatives:
	ecological implication:
		due to use of hvy, indigenous varieties of crops were totally neglected.
		decrease in biodiversity of crops.
		soil degradation.
		soil salinization.
		use of chemical fertilizers increases soil erosion.
		groundwater depletion.
		deforestation.
economical issues:
	neglect of dryland agriculture.
	an increase in inequality as richer farmer became richer & poor farmer couldn't afford capital inputs for green revolution.
social issues:
	social disparity within regions increased.
	intra-regional disparity also increased causing increase of landless laborers.
	there was increase in agricultural migration creating social tensions.
	increased use of drugs( due to sudden increase in income) & cancer(due to chemical fertilizers). movie- `udta punjab`
	internal security: [[khalistan movement]] gained momentum after green revolution.
# cropping seasons of india
(2.26 pm)

there are 3 cropping seasons in india: #pneumonic _krz 353_

	in some southern states, maize is grown in winter also.

*zaid season*:
	grown b/w monsoon & winter season.
	major crops: fruits, vegetables, & some oilseeds.
# cropping conditions
(2.47 pm)
- factors that determine cropping conditions are [[temperature]], [[precipitation]], & [[soil]]. #pneumonic _tps_ *time-21:00 date-2021-09-24* tapas in [[sanskrit]] = heat - tattoo of [[maroon 5]]

`mineral & energy resources`
(4.05 pm)

there are 2 types of minerals:
metallic: ferrous & non-ferrous.
non-metallic: organic & non-organic minerals.
important minerals:

`iron`:
it's used for steel making.
there are 4 types of iron ore in decreasing quality: #pneumonic mhls #pre 
*magnetite*: black in color.
*hematite*; red in color
*limonite*: brown in color
*siderite*: yellow/ grey in color
magnetite is igneous rest is sedimentary in nature.
major regions: eastern europe, lake superior in usa, brazil, australia, china, etc.

`tin`:
important regions: [[se asia]] is very rich in tin.

# energy resources
(4.33 pm)
`coal`:
it's formed due to anaerobic decomposition of vegetation when it goes subduction over a long period of time.
more carbon content better quality of coal. #pneumonic _coal ablp_ #pre 
	*anthracite*: best quality of coal with nearly 95% of carbon.
	*bituminous*: 80-45% of carbon content.
	*lignite*: 38%-45% of carbon content.
	*peat*: less than 38% carbon content.
regions: usa & russia are very rich in coal.
india has a good quantity of coal but quality is low.

`petroleum`:
it's formed due to submergence of organisms on continental shelf.
regions: north sea, gulf of mexico, middle east, north africa, etc.

`shale gas`:
[[geopolitics]] [[=unrivaled]] [[prisoners of geography]]
it's a natural gas that is trapped in shale formations.
it's found mainly in sedimentary basins.
