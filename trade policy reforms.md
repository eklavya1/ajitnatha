Reduction of tariff rates (Not Increasing the Tariff rates).
Dismantling of quantitative restrictions on imports and exports.
Quantitative restrictions on imports of manufactured consumer goods and agricultural products were also fully removed from April 2001.
Removal of licensing procedures for imports.
Import licensing in India is abolished except in the case of hazardous and environmentally sensitive industries.
Export duties have been removed to increase the competitive position of Indian goods in the international markets.
Before the trade and investment policy reforms were undertaken, India was following a regime of quantitative restrictions on imports to protect its domestic industries. This was encouraged through tight control over imports and by keeping the tariffs very high. However, these policies reduced efficiency and competitiveness which led to slow growth of the manufacturing sector.
Hence, liberalization of trade and investment regime was initiated to increase the international competitiveness of industrial production and also foreign investments and technology into the economy. The aim was also to promote the efficiency of local industries and the adoption of modern technologies.
