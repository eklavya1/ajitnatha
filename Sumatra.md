sumatra is one of the [[sunda islands]] of western indonesia. it is the largest island that is fully within [[indonesia]]n territory, as well as the sixth-largest island in the world at 473,481 km2 (182,812 mi.2), not including adjacent islands such as the simeulue, nias, mentawai, enggano, riau islands, bangka belitung and krakatoa archipelago.

sumatra is an elongated landmass spanning a diagonal northwestâ€“southeast axis. the indian ocean borders the west, northwest, and southwest coasts of sumatra, with the island chain of simeulue, nias, mentawai, and enggano off the western coast. in the northeast, the narrow strait of malacca separates the island from the malay peninsula, which is an extension of the eurasian continent. in the southeast, the narrow sunda strait, containing the krakatoa archipelago, separates sumatra from java. the northern tip of sumatra is near the andaman islands, while off the southeastern coast lie the islands of bangka and belitung, karimata strait and the java sea. the bukit barisan mountains, which contain several active volcanoes, form the backbone of the island, while the northeastern area contains large plains and lowlands with swamps, mangrove forest and complex river systems. the equator crosses the island at its centre in west sumatra and riau provinces. the climate of the island is tropical, hot, and humid. lush tropical rain forest once dominated the landscape.

sumatra has a wide range of plant and animal species but has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years. many species are now critically endangered, such as the sumatran ground cuckoo, the sumatran tiger, the sumatran elephant, the sumatran rhinoceros, and the sumatran orangutan. deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the 2013 southeast asian haze which caused considerable tensions between indonesia and affected countries malaysia and singapore.
