- In ecology, edge effects are changes in [[population]] or community structures that occur at the boundary of two or more habitats. Areas with small habitat fragments exhibit especially pronounced edge effects that may extend throughout the range. As the edge effects increase, the boundary habitat allows for greater biodiversity.

- Urbanization is causing humans to continuously fragment the land and thus increase the edge effect.  This change in landscape ecology is proving to have consequences.  Generalist species, especially invasive ones, have been seen to benefit from this landscape change whilst species requiring a specific niche of interior forest are suffering.  For example, the alpha diversity of edge-intolerant birds in Lacandona rainforest, Mexico, is decreasing as edge effects increase.
