[[2022-05-21]] 19:21 [Schumpeter’s Theory of Economic Development | Economics](https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/economic-development/schumpeters-theory-economic-development/schumpeters-theory-of-economic-development-economics/30174)
- Schumpeter’s theory of development assigns paramount role to the entrepreneur and innovations introduced by him in the process of economic development. According to Schumpeter, the process of production is marked by a combination of material and immaterial productive forces. The material productive forces arise from the original factors of production, viz., land and labour, etc., while the immaterial set of productive forces are conditioned by the ‘technical facts’ and ‘facts of social organization’. The Schumpeterian production function can, therefore, be written as –

Q = ƒ [k, r, I, u, ν) …(1)

Where, Q stands for the output, k for the Schumpeterian concept of “produced means of production”, r for natural resources, l for the employed labour force. The symbol u represents the society’s fund of technical knowledge and ν represents the facts of social organization, i.e., the socio-cultural milieu within which the economy operates.
