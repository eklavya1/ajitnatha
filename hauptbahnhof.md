- central stations or central railway stations emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century as railway stations that had initially been built on the edge of city centres were enveloped by urban expansion and became an integral part of the city centres themselves. as a result, "central station" is often, but not always, part of the proper name for a railway station that is the central or primary railway hub for a city.
