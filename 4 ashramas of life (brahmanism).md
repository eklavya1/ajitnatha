- o Around the time when Jainism and Buddhism were becoming popular, brahmins developed the system of ashramas.
- Brahmin, Kshatriya, and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (Brahmacharya).
- Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands.
