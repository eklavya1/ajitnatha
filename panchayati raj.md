a major portion of part ix of [[constitution]] deals with structural empowerment of PRIs but real strength in terms of both autonomy & [[efficiency]] of these institutions is dependent on their financial position (including their capacity to generate their own resources). ln general, panchayats in our [[country]] receive funds in following ways -
- grants from union [[government]] based on recommendations of central finance commission as per [[a280 finance commission]] of constitution.
- devolution from [[state]] government based on recommendations of state [[finance]] commission as per article 243-1.
loans/grants from state govemment.
programme-specific allocation under centrally sponsored schemes & additional central assistance.
internal [[resource]] generation (tax & non-tax).
gram sabha owns minor [[mineral]]s & revenue generation from them is also owned by them.
## additional information
local self-government has 2 core guiding principles i.e. decentralization & grassroots empowerment.
it is under 73rd & 74th constitutional amendments.
local self-government bodies are political entities.
these bodies are elected directly or indirectly by people & are managed by their representatives.
there can be no direct [[democracy]] as in direct democracy all decisions are made directly by people.
