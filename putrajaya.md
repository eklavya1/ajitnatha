- putrajaya (malaysian pronunciation: [putraˈdʒaja, putrəˈdʒajə]), officially the federal territory of putrajaya (malay: wilayah persekutuan putrajaya), is a - planned capital city which functions as the administrative capital and the judicial capital of malaysia. the seat of the federal government of malaysia was shifted in 1999 from kuala lumpur to putrajaya because of overcrowding and congestion in the former, whilst the seat of the judiciary of malaysia was later shifted to putrajaya in 2003. [[kuala lumpur]] remains as malaysia's national capital city per the constitution and is still the seat of the head of state (yang di-pertuan agong) and the national legislature (parliament of malaysia), as well as being the country's commercial and financial centre.

the establishment of putrajaya was the idea of the then-prime minister mahathir mohamad. the development of putrajaya began in august 1995 and it was completed at an estimated cost of us$8.1 billion. on february 1, 2001, putrajaya became malaysia's third federal territory, after kuala lumpur in 1974 and labuan in 1984. putrajaya is also a part of msc malaysia, a special economic zone that covers klang valley.
