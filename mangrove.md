mangroves are salt-tolerant trees that grow in tropical & subtropical coastal areas around world.
they often form vast impermeable thickets & serve as a buffer b/w marine & terrestrial environments.
mangroves occur worldwide in tropics & subtropics & even some temperate coastal areas, mainly b/w latitudes 300 n & 300 s, with greatest mangrove area within 50 of equator.
mangroves are salt-tolerant trees, also c/a halophytes, & are adapted to live in harsh coastal conditions.
they contain a complex salt filtration system & a complex root system to cope with saltwater immersion & wave action.
they are adapted to low-oxygen conditions of waterlogged mud but are most likely to thrive in upper 1/2 of intertidal zone.
mangrove biome, often c/a mangrove forest, is a distinct saline woodland or shrubland habitat characterized by depositional coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action.
physically, mangroves trap sediments with their many roots, helping to reduce erosion & improve water quality.
they also protect shorelines from damaging winds, waves, & floods & can reduce impact of storms.
mangroves are extremely important ecologically. they provide a habitat for a diverse array of terrestrial organisms & are nesting sites for many 
species of birds.
mangrove forest cover in india:
forest survey of india has been assessing mangrove forest cover using remote sensing since 1987.
current assessment shows that mangrove cover in country is 4,975 sq km [(1.2 million acres)], which is o. 15% of country's total geographical area.
west bengal has 42.45% of india's mangrove cover, followed by gujarat 23.66% & a&n islands 12.39%
andhra pradesh has 8.12% of india's mangrove cover while tamil nadu has just about 0.90%.

mangrove, any of certain shrubs & trees that belong primarily to families rhizophoraceae, acanthaceae, lythraceae, combretaceae, & arecaceae; that grow in dense thickets or forests along tidal estuaries, in salt marshes, & on muddy coasts; & that characteristically have prop roots—i.e., exposed supporting roots.
term mangrove also applies to thickets & forests of such plants.
respiratory or knee roots (pneumatophores) are characteristic of many species; they project above mud & have small openings (lenticels) through which air enters, passing through soft spongy tissue to roots beneath mud.
mangroves are extremely important to coastal ecosystems they inhabit.
physically, they serve as a buffer b/w marine & terrestrial communities & protect shorelines from damaging winds, waves, & floods.
mangrove thickets improve water quality by filtering pollutants & trapping sediments from land, & they reduce coastal erosion.
ecologically, they provide habitat for a diverse array of terrestrial organisms, & many species of coastal & offshore fish & shellfish rely exclusively on mangroves as their breeding, spawning, & hatching grounds.
 b/c of their high salt tolerance, mangroves are often among 1st species to colonize mud & sandbanks flooded by seawater, but increase in coastal development & altered land use led to a decline in global populations.
several species are listed as vulnerable or endangered on international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list of threatened species.
