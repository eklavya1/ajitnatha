## giffn goods
(1.13 pm)
[[giffin goods]]
some infrior goods
ex:
initially, income o family is rs. 1000.
family consumes 2 items potatoes & eggs.
price o potatoes is rs. 10 pr kg
price o egg is rs. 10 pr egg.
consumptn is 20 kg o potatoes & 20 eggs.
totl xpenditure= rs. 400
now, let us assume dt income is rs. 1500.
egg is a norml good & potato is infrior good.
so, consumptn o eggs'l increase.
now, price o eggs'l increase b/c income o households is increasing.
hence, mr quantty is beng demandd o eggs.
whn eggs bcm costly, thre cn be a situation, dt eggs bcm so costly dt they r less affordable thn before.
so, again, consumptn o potatoes'l increase & price'l also increase. it's violatv o law o demand.

## giffn goods
crtn goods n vry sp circumstances may sem t violat law o demand.
giffn goods r those infrior goods dt show behavior dt their quantty demandd increases whn thre is increase n their price n crtn sp circumstances.
illustratn o 1 such circumstance:
suppose at a givn level o income, a household consumes 2 goods, 1 norml & 1 infrior at sm rat & n sm quantty.
whn income o household increases, it's xpectd dt they'l consume mr o norml good & less o infrior good.
it may so hpn whn consumptn o norml good increases, its price increases as a result. increase n price may be t such xtent ds norml good becomes less affordable thn it ws before increase n income.
in such a situation, household may choose t substitut consumptn o ds norml good wd infrior good.
since consumptn o infrior goods now increases, threfore, its price is also xpectd t increase.
whn its price increases, ds leaves lessr amount o income available fr household t spend n norml good.
ds makes norml good evn mr unaffordable.
as a result, consumptn o norml goods is reducd furthr & is substitutd by infrior good. 
threfore, infrior good shows behavior dt its price is increasng & simultaneously its quantty demandd is also increasing, suggestng a violatn o law o demand.
