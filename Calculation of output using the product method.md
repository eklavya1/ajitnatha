#quran - 2|81|بَلَىٰ مَن كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيئَتُهُ فَأُولَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ

- [[2021-12-09]] `21:26` _related_ [[Value-added method]]
- To calculate the output, the value-added method is used.
- The rationale is the following:
	- [[GDP]] is defined as the value of final goods produced…
	- That is while calculating the [[output]]; we are concerned only with final goods as including intermediate goods will cause double counting.
	- Therefore, when it comes to GDP, we need to ensure that only final goods are identified to calculate the output.
- In a real-world [[economy]], separating the final goods and intermediate goods becomes very difficult.
- Firms produce goods - they may not know whether their good is being used as a final or intermediate good.
- As a result, separating becomes impossible and therefore the GDP estimation would be inaccurate.
- The value-added method overcomes this problem.
