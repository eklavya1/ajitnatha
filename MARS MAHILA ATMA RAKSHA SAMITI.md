- • Mahila Atma Raksha Samiti (MARS)  was founded in 1942, in the midst of the [[world war 2]] (1939-45) in the undivided Bengal on the eve of the Great Bengal Famine. 
 - • MARS had its origin in the Congress Mahila Sangha, formed in Calcutta in 1939 with the objective to prepare for defense against the Japanese occupation of Bengal. Later it became a mass organization closely linked to the Communist Party of India
 - • Rani Mitra Dasgupta, Manikuntala Sen and Renu Chakravartty were key leaders of MARS. But the organization also gathered prominent non-communist, liberal women like Rani Mahalanobis wife of Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis and Leela Mazumdar.
 - • MARS adopted three basic programs: 
 - ◦ Defense of the country,
 - ◦ Release of political prisoners and formation of a National Government, and
 - ◦ saving the population from starvation and death. The first two programs, particularly, the 'Release Gandhi' campaign of the MARS attracted a group of nationalist leaders and leading intellectuals.
 - • The third program was almost exclusively adopted for saving the people from the effects of the war and the famine. 
 - • The MARS organized hunger processions of women in Calcutta and the districts. The first-ever women's hunger procession in India was organized by a college student Alaka Majumdar.
