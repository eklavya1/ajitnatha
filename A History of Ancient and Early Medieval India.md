teaching is ultimately about the quality of communication between student and teacher. — location: [626]()

---
Historians and teachers invest far too much time and energy in telling students what to think, rather than how to think for themselves. Students need to learn to evaluate evidence and hypotheses, to relentlessly question and critique what they read or are told, and formulate and express their independent views. — location: [638]()

The privileging of certain processes over others is partly the result of the training and tendency of a historian to focus on what appear to be significant changes, and also due to the inherent nature and inadequacies of sources and available data. The fact is that whether we look at the archaeological or literary sources, we know much more about agricultural groups than hunter-gatherers, and much more about city-dwellers than village folk. — location: [648]()

History is essentially a discipline that inquires into the experiences of people who lived in the past. Historians often classify the past by dividing it into different periods. Labels are convenient, but they should be meaningful and consistent, and it is necessary to be aware of their limitations. — location: [831]()

Writing marked a new stage in human expression and communication. It opened new possibilities for storing and transmitting ideas and knowledge across distance and time. — location: [854]()

---
Its impact was complex and varied. Rulers used writing to advertise and exercise power, [[merchants]] to record business transactions, priests to preserve religious texts, and poets to give permanence to their creative expression. — location: [856]()

---
We can speculate about the precise impulses that led to the invention of writing, but all over the world (with a few exceptions) it coincided with the emergence of cities and states. For these reasons, historians consider the beginning of writing an important watershed in the story of ancient cultures. — location: [857]()

---
However, in a situation where relatively few people knew how to read or write, writing gave a certain power and privilege to those who knew it and denied it to those who did not. — location: [859]()

However, while the heartlands of great empires and kingdoms are well represented, many regions—for instance the North-East—are not. Such regions have to be brought into the ambit of history. — location: [975]()

There is a close relationship between history and identity; the past has, therefore, always been a contested terrain. — location: [993]()

---
The most important thing that history can do is to teach us to think historically. — location: [1003]()

---
No less important is the fact that the story of the past contains much that is interesting and exciting. That in itself is enough justification for reading and writing history. — location: [1005]()

There can never be a single, final, perfect history. There can never be a complete or exact picture of what happened in the past; the task of the historian is to bring us as close as possible to such a picture. — location: [1024]()

Debate and disagreement are an important part of the growth of all forms of knowledge, and history is no exception. — location: [1028]()

Information has to be teased out with care, skill, and ingenuity to make historical inferences. — location: [1039]()

Kovalan (the son of a wealthy merchant) and Kannaki are a young, happily married couple living in Puhar. Kovalan falls in love with a beautiful courtesan named Madhavi and abandons his wife. He eventually returns home after quarrelling with Madhavi. Kannaki welcomes him back and offers him her golden anklet to raise some money. They travel to Madurai, capital of the Pandya king, accompanied by a Jaina nun named Kavundi. Kovalan goes off to sell his wife’s anklet. He is accused of stealing the queen’s anklet, which looks just like Kannaki’s, and is executed. Kannaki is devastated. She proves her husband’s innocence by bursting open her other anklet—it contains a ruby, whereas the queen’s was filled with pearls. The king, who had executed a man unjustly, dies of remorse; his wife dies of grief. Kannaki tears off her left breast and hurls it onto the city in fury. Madurai is engulfed in flames. Kannaki joins her husband in heaven; on earth she comes to be worshipped as the ideal wife. — location: [1492]()
