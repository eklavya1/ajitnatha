## CONTINUATION OF d INEQUALITY & d GROWTH MODELS

## TRICKLE DOWN GROWTH MODEL
[[trickle down theory ##economics 08]]
 
 ## INCLUSIVE GROWTH MODEL / APPROACH
(1:26 PM)
- like _chappan bhog_ - d thali of [[democracy]]
- Inclusive growth is broad-based growth. d objective is to make d people at d bottom capable so that they can contribute to d growth & enjoy d benefits as a matter of right. It includes imparting skills & reducing social vulnerabilities.
- It differs from trickle-down as- in trickle-down- people at d bottom are **passive beneficiaries** of d development. In d sense that they are not contributing, but simply receiving fruits of growth
- Since d bottom [[population]] is an active participant & contributor to growth, fruits of growth are their right & are not dependent on some other assumptions.
- Proper participation of d lower-rung population is dependent on d provision of social security benefits such as subsidized health services, good quality education, retirement payments, etc, along with skill training & employment opportunities.
- These are d elements that develop d capability of d individuals so that they can reap their full potential.
_- This is d central aspect of d capability approach as proposed by [[amartya Sen]]._
- d major elements for capacity development can be Skill development, Reduction of poverty, Job creation, Industrial development, Special focus on vulnerable people, Reduction of regional disparities, etc.
- Inclusive growth is also premised on economic growth – d development of industries so that more jobs & income can be created. d major difference is that inclusive growth is broad-based rather than specifically focused.
- It may be so that inclusive growth leads to a lesser overall growth when compared to d trickle-down model. However trickle-down model may not result in a general improvement in d standard of living, whereas inclusive growth is expected to improve standards more broadly.

## Differences between Trickle down & Inclusive growth approaches:

Trickle Down Approach
Inclusive Growth Approach

- It is specifically focused on a sector/section, which is believed to be more capable to utilise resources.
- It focused on including all d sections into d development process simultaneously, with a special focus on poorer sections.

- d population at d lowest rung of development is a passive participant in d development process.
- Even d population at d lowest rung of development is an active participant in d development process.

- Provisioning of fruits of development to d population at d bottom depends upon d fulfillment of certain assumptions, like if d favored sectors were able to generate enough profits to be shared with d poor.
- Provisioning fruits of development to d population at d bottom is a matter of their right.

## UNEMPLOYMENT
2:50 PM)
- [[unemployment]]
- Unemployment is basically a subjective thing based upon how a person views his role at d workplace or relation with d employer.
- At a basic level, it can be taken as - inability to find work when you are willing to work.
- It does not consider d desire to work, but a meaningfully expressed desire to find work.
- d true status can be assessed by a Questionnaire that covers different aspects of employment, qualifications, & other personal situations.

## Labor force
- It is understood as d economically active population.
- Example- If there are 100 people, out of which only 50 want to work & only 40 actually work. Here d rest 10 would be considered unemployed. In this case, d unemployment rate would be (10/50)* 100= 20%, & not (10/100)*100 = 10%.

## Working Age
- Simply d age bracket in which d persons are considered economically productive & capable to sustain themselves & others.
- Different countries use different definitions for d age bracket. In India, sometimes (18years-59years) or (15years -64years) are used.
- Both are correct in their essence as though d general minimum age is 18 years, but younger children can work in cinema, non-hazardous family work, etc.
- If given to choose between both options, we have to go with 15years -64 years.

## Dependent Population
It is d part of not working age population-population below 15 years & beyond 64 years.
Dependency ratio- dependent population/ total population.
To be taken care for prelims: Dependency ratio does not consider- working-age population, or total number of workers or total number of workers or number of taxpayers

## Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR)
It measures d proportion of d population willing to work in a specific section. It is a refined measure to see labor force participation in a target group.
A person who is not looking for a job is not considered under this cohort. It means full-time students, homemakers, individuals above 64, etc are not considered for its calculation.
Labour Force Participation Rate = Labour force in a group / Population of that group.

## Demographic Dividend
It is d expected increase in d economic outcome of an economy when d proportion of d working-age population increases in d overall population.
It means that if d demographic structure of d country is young & skilled then a country can potentially benefit from it.
A young population is energetic, more productive, & is eager to update their skills. Therefore a country’s incomes & standards of living can increase at a faster pace if such is d demographic composition.
India is expected to reap a rich demographic dividend as 62.5% Indian population is in d 15-64 age group.
The favorable demographic situation of India is expected to last till 2055.
Proper & timely facilities for education, skill development, & healthcare are necessary for d timely & proper realization of demographic dividend. Otherwise, d same favorable characteristics may turn into a disaster

## Unemployment
Defined as a situation where a person willing to work fails to find work.
Willingness to work is not merely a desire to work, rather, it is a meaningfully expressed intention to work.

## Worker population ratio

It is d ratio of workrs as per total population. Usually expressed as a number of workers per 1000 population.
