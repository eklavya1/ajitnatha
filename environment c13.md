Environment Class 13

## Water Pollution
(1:18 PM)

Sources: Discharge of un-treated municipal sewage, industrial effluent, agricultural fields, etc.
Types of Water Pollution:
Fresh Water Pollution: Example of lakes, wetlands, rivers, etc.
Marine Pollution: Port Harbour, fishing, oil spill, plastics.
Point Sources: Exact sources from which pollutants being discharged can be treated.
Non-Point Sources: Multiple sources of water pollutants coming from the disposed area.
Marine Pollution:
Marine pollution is a combination of chemicals and trash.
Most of which comes from land sources and is washed or blown into the ocean.
This pollution results in damage to the environment, to the health of all organisms, and to economic structures worldwide.
Great Pacific Garbage Patch: It is a collection of marine debris in the North Pacific Ocean. Also known as the Pacific trash vortex, the garbage patch is actually two distinct collections of debris bounded by the massive North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.

## NIMBI Syndrome
(1:31 PM)

It is an acronym for "Not In My Back Yard".
The NIMBY concept attempts to explain this phenomenon of low public acceptance of new development.

Ground Pollutant and Disease related to it                      (1:47 PM)

**Ground Water Pollutant**
**Disease**

Mercury
Minamata

Lead
Dyslexia, liver and kidney damage.

Fluoride
Fluorosis

Nitrate
Blue-Baby Syndrome

Cadmium
Itai-Itai

Arsenic
Black Foot Disease

### Impacts
(2:01 PM)
On human health (Disease viz: cholera, diarrhea, animal disease, etc.)
#### Eutrophication
It is an enrichment of water bodies with pollutants (Nutrient).
Nutrients could be Nitrate & Phosphate.
These nutrients are taken by Algae which grows luxuriantly (Algal Bloom).
It results in the Death of Algae that results in the breakdown of algal biomass by Aerobic Bacteria which consumed dissolved oxygen biochemical Oxygen demand.

BOD and COD          (2:11 PM)

BOD
COD

Dissolve oxygen used by Aerobic bacteria to decompose organic matter.
Dissolve oxygen used for the oxidation of both organic as well as inorganic material.

BOD basically are organic matter
It could be organic as well as inorganic

A sample is incubated for 5 days.
Potassium Permanganate needs to measure the amount of the COD.

### Solution
(2:18 PM)
Treatment of Sewage by municipalities in ‚ÄúSewage Treatment Plant‚Äù
Industrial effluents to be treated by Effluent Treatment Plants. SPCBs monitor and prescribe parameters for the common effluent treatment plant.
Standard/Norms prescribed under the laws: Water Pollution Prevention and Control Act, 1974. CPCB along with SCPB formed under this act which looks into ambient water quality.
Government Policies and Programmes to deal with water pollution, examples are Namami Ganga (National Mission for Clean Ganga), etc.

## NAMAI GANGA           (2:36 PM)

National Ganga Council is headed by the Chairman (PM).
National Clean Ganga Fund is there.
Important components are Nirmal Dhara, Aviral Dhara, Protection of biodiversity.
Setting up treatment plants, ghats, and crematoria.
Even the government bringing open defecation-free villages.

## Thermal Pollution      (2:41 PM)

Discharge of the hot water into water bodies. Sources are boilers, thermal power plants, etc.
The amount of dissolved water decreases.
It affects aquatic organisms.
An increase in the temperature of the water affects the larva or eggs of aquatic animals.
It decreases the activity of the aerobic decomposer like bacteria which require dissolved oxygen for the breakdown of the organic matter.

## Soil or Land Pollution       (3:02 PM)
Sources: Mining activities, dumping of garbage and solid waste, use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, plastics, heavy metals
Impact
Bio-magnification in the food chain,
leaching of chemicals and heavy metals to groundwater causing groundwater pollution,
diseases due to consumption of such polluted groundwater.
Runoff to the water bodies and aquatic bodies thereby causing eutrophication,
Reduction in soil fertility that will affect the crop year and food insecurity

## Land Degradation and Desertification      (3:11 PM)
It is a loss of nutrient/soil quality.
It refers to loss of fertility of the cultivated land in Arid, Semi-Arid and Dry sub-humid zones due to land degradation caused by climate change as well as due to human activities such as over-irrigation, overgrazing, excessive use of chemical examples are fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides, etc. or desertification, etc.
### Impacts
Impacts are more severe in the sub-Saharan region and even in South Asia
In India almost around 1/3rd of the land is under the grip of desertification.
It results in famine, drought, less rainfall, loss of the income of the people (Livelihood), food insecurity, distress migration of local communities, etc.
Great Green Wall: A pan African proposal to plant a wall of trees at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert to battle desertification.

## Combating Global Problems of Desertification
(3:28 PM)
UNCCD (UN Convention to Combat Desertification)
This convention was adopted in 1994 under the Agenda 21 of the Rio Conference.
It is only legally Binding International to sustainable land management. The UNCCD follows a bottom-up approach by empowering local communities at the grassroots level to fight desertification in terms of taking actions to prevent land degradation.
It also involves a participatory model to combat desertification by the involvement of civil society, government agencies, and scientific organizations and corporates.
The UNCCD secretariats facilitate cooperation between developed and developing countries, particularly around knowledge and technology transfer for sustainable land management.
The Convention addresses specifically the Arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, known as the drylands, where some of the most vulnerable ecosystems and the people can be found.
The UNCCD collaborates closely with the other two Rio Conventions. That is the CBD and UNFCCC, to meet the complex challenges with an integrated approach and best possible use of natural resources.
The UNCCD 2018-30 strategic Framework is the most comprehensive global commitment to achieve land degradation neutrality (LDN) Fund in order to restore the productivity of vast expanses of degraded land.
Sustainable development Goal 15 includes the combat for desertification.

## SOLUTION
(3:48 PM)

Recycling and reuse of solid waste in order to prevent dumping on land.
Minimal or optimal use of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. An initiative like ‚ÄúNeem Coated Urea‚Äù for the slow release of Nitrogen to the soil. Soil Health Card
Contamination/Polluted on soil must be treated
Prevention of deforestation
Scientific methods of farming, promoting Organic farming, Agroforestry, etc.
Micro-Irrigation such as drip cultivation, sprinklers, etc.
Great Green Wall

## Nuclear or Radiation Pollution
(4:00 PM)

Gamma Rays, X-Rays, UV Rays are all ionizing radiations. They affect cells, tissues, genes, etc. causing somatic damage and genetic mutation.

### Sources:
Testing of nuclear weapons
Nuclear accidents (Chernobyl Disaster, 1986; Fukushima, 2011);
Radio-isotopes used in R&D,
Nuclear Medicines (Co-60 radioisotopes used for the treatment of cancer)
Mining of Uranium
Nuclear waste generated in nuclear reactors.

## Solutions
Promotion of renewable energy programmes such as solar power, wind power, etc.
Nuclear safety guidelines in the mining of Uranium, handling, processing of radioactive material, etc.
Better and safer nuclear waste management. (Waste is safely dumped under the impervious rocks in the deep earth)
Prevention of the Nuclear Weapon test (Treaty like CTBT).
Nuclear safety of nuclear reactors and associated facilities.
Safety guidelines for safe disposal of radioisotopes used in labs hospitals.

The topic for the next class discussion: Pollution Related Indian Institutions, EIA.
