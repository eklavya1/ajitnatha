class started with a brief discussion of previous class (1.26 pm)

how india pushed to margins in international diplomacy vis-a-vis afghanistan.
india's efforts for state-building in afghanistan.
india was not invited to various peace conferences like moscow conferences, trio conferences, etc.

continuation of india -afghanistan relationship (1.30 pm)
continuation of india -afghanistan relationship (1.30 pm)

india being left out on platform of international diplomacy is a remnant of 1990s.
at that time, on insistence of pakistan, india was kept out of crucial global forums on afghanistan.
presently also, usa is crucially dependent on pakistan, it's important for successful implementation of doha deal as orderly withdrawal as possible.
india as 1 of significant regional power whose security is likely to be affected by ongoing afghanistan quagmire, it should have found a place for itself in global diplomacy vis-a-vis afghanistan.

why india should find itself a place on global tables vis-a-vis afghanistan? (1.46 pm)
why india should find itself a place on global tables vis-a-vis afghanistan? (1.46 pm)

1) india's security is intrinsically linked to development in afghanistan.
given taliban's propensity to provide safe heaven to other terror groups, india feared increase in kashmir insurgency & security threats to rest of india.
it was hostile relations of india with taliban which was used during indian airline ic 814 hijacking in 1999.
2) a destabilized & talibanised afghanistan posed imminent security threat to indian investment in afghanistan.
3) since india is working to increase its physical presence in region through connectivity projects like chabahar port, instc (international north-south transport corridor, a hostile national govt in afghanistan can halt such connectivity efforts.
it will have major impacts on india's regional ties with central asia & europe.
4) there is fear of rising of narco-terrorist state in afghanistan i.e rise of opium production & opium trade. 
fact that taliban derived up to 60 % of their annual revenue from illicit narcotics.
from new delhi's perspective, its effort to curb terror finance at home would achieve only limited success if anti-india groups such as let & jem, which continue to operate in afghanistan manage to tap into money from such narco trade.
as a part of agreement with taliban, (doha deal) & us, former has agreed to prevent use of afghanistan soil against security of us & its allies.
but it's not clear whether india has been included as a us ally.

way forward (2.08 pm)
way forward (2.08 pm)

steps that were already taken by govt. of india:
change in indian govt's attitude with respect to taliban.
in apparent climb down from its earlier position emphasizing intra-afghan process/dialogue as sole solution to afghani crisis, today india supports un-led process of engaging with taliban.
india has responded to taliban's request for humanitarian assistance to afghanistan by supply of essential medicines to afghanistan.
india has also accepted taliban's request to supply food grains to afghanistan.
india has offered to supply 50000 tons of wheat to afghanistan through land route.
india's external affairs minister through a video link addressed inaugural session of intra-afghan dialogue in september 2020.
this was 1st time indian official addressed a gathering that included taliban.
india also participated in march 2021 russia hosted peace conference on afghanistan bringing together govt. representative along with international observers.
evolution of india's position is in sync with evolving reality in afghanistan so much so that by 15th august, taliban occupied kabul.

suggestions (2.29 pm)
suggestions (2.29 pm)

india should continue with capacity-building measures in afghanistan.
india should press for inclusive govt in kabul.
india should insist on existing interim taliban govt. to be replaced by a more inclusive govt of which taliban is a part.

conclusion (2.34 pm)
conclusion (2.34 pm)

india finds itself in a catch 22 situation.
if taliban regime is stabilized in afghanistan without india's assistance, more it's likely to support pakistan's agenda vis-a-vis india.
on other hand, more india helps taliban-led afghanistan, more pakistan will up its ante in kashmir.
earlier pakistan's willingness conciliary towards india on kashmir before in a run-up to taliban's takeover to afghanistan seems to have disappeared.
reduction in violence in kashmir foll february ceasefire agreement is now doing away with violence once again rising in jammu & kashmir.
also, earlier pakistani stand that it would accept india's decision to withdraw sp status to kashmir in lieu of  new delhi's restoring statehood to kashmir & allowing political activity in state.
these sentiments now stand changed.
india's desire to lead discussion on afghanistan's future as demonstrated by nsa dialogue is a worthy goal for a regional leader but can only be fulfilled once govt defines more clearly what it wants its afghan roles to be, despite all differences with regime now in power.
(note* 3rd regional security dialogue on afghanistan at nsa level hosted by india.
participated countries:
russia,
iran, 
all 5 central asian countries,

china has economic interest in afghanistan & seems to be foll pakistan's policy on afghanistan.
 china presently enjoys good relations with talibanised afghanistan.

pakistan's afghanistan policy (3.32 pm)
pakistan's afghanistan policy (3.32 pm)

pakistan has official policy seeking strategic depth in afghanistan which in layman's terms refers to pakistan wanting to have a puppet govt. in afghanistan.
reasons:
1) pakistan's security dilemma vis-a-vis india.
in case india has a good relationship with afghan govt. or is militarily present in afghanistan, pakistan remains fearful of india opening a 2nd war front against it along its western borders in case of war with india.
2) insecurity dilemma:
it relates to aspiration of pashtun population who have been artificially divided b/w pakistan & afghanistan by imperial durand line to form independent/ sovereign greater pashtunstan.
pakistani pashtuns want to join their afghani brotherance in case of creation of greater/ independent pashtunistan is not possible.
it will threaten territorial integrity of pakistan & therefore consequent insecurity.

india - nepal relationship (3.50 pm)
india - nepal relationship (3.50 pm)

india doesn't have independent nepal policy. it's a subset of india's china policy. examine this statement. (150 words/ 10 marks)
despite india-nepal unprecedented closeness in terms of culture, geography, & people -to- people relations, their relations remain fraught with challenges. comment (150 words/ 10 marks)
evidence of closeness:
1) as close neighbors, india & nepal share a unique relationship characterized by open borders & deep-rooted people-to-people relations.
there is a long tradition of free movement of people across borders sharing family ties & culture. (roti-beti culture)
2) cultural connection b/w 2 countries run from lumbini to bodhgaya & from pashupati nath to kashi vishwanath (buddhism & hinduism)
3) dominant languages of nepal are nepali, bhojpuri, & maithili which are rooted in indian language of sanskrit, hindi, & pali.
4) shah kings of nepal are sisodiya rajputs of rajasthan.
5) nepal's himalayas & terai region continue into northern plains of india to reinforce their bond as sub-himalayan strategic entities.
6) nepal has a total of 29 million population of which 6 to 7 million live & work in india.
7) indian army has a sp regiment c/a gorkha regiment which recruits nepali gorkhas.
no other 2 countries in world are as closely associated geographically, religiously, linguistically, or security-wise.
such is their closeness that political scholar s.d.muni has commented that 2 countries are lodged in each other's intestines.
despite such closeness, relations b/w 2 countries remained fraught with challenges.
