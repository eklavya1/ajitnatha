Two broad orders of temples in the country are known— Nagara in the north and Dravida in the south.
The Dravida temple is enclosed within a compound wall.
The front wall has an entrance gateway in its centre, which is known as a gopuram.
The shape of the main temple tower known as vimana in Tamil Nadu is like a stepped pyramid that rises up geometrically rather than the curving shikhara of 
North India.
In the South Indian temple, the word 'shikhara' is used only for the crowning element at the top of the temple which is usually shaped like a small stupika or an octagonal cupola—
this is equivalent to the amlak and kalasha of North Indian temples.
It is common to find a large water reservoir, or a temple tank, enclosed within the complex.
Subsidiary shrines are either incorporated within the main temple tower or located as distinct, separate small shrines beside the main temple.
There are subdivisions also of Dravida temples. These are basically of five different shapes:
• Square, usually called kuta, and also caturasra
• Rectangular or shala or ayatasra
• Elliptical, called gaja-prishta or elephantbacked, or also called vrittayata, deriving from wagon vaulted shapes of apsidal chaityas with a horse-shoe shaped entrance facade usually called a nasi.
• Circular or vritta
• Octagonal or ashtasra.
