1925
The Kakori Conspiracy (or Kakori train robbery) was a train robbery that took place at Kakori, a village near Lucknow, on 9 August 1925 during the Indian [[Independence]] Movement against the [[British]] Raj. The robbery was organised by [[Hindustan]] Republican Association (HRA).

The robbery was conceived by `Ram Prasad Bismil` and Ashfaqullah [[Khan]] who belonged to the HRA, which later became the [[Hindustan]] [[socialist]] Republican Association. This [[organisation]] was established to carry out revolutionary activities against the [[British]] Empire in India with the objective of achieving [[independence]]. Since the [[organisation]] needed money for purchase of weaponry, Bismil and his party decided to plunder a train on one of the Northern Railway lines.[1] The robbery plan was executed by Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqulla [[Khan]], Rajendra Lahiri, Chandrashekhar Azad, Sachindra Bakshi, Keshab Chakravarty, Manmathnath [[Gupta]], Mukundi Lal (Mukundi Lal [[Gupta]]), Murari Lal [[Gupta]] and Banwari Lal.[2][3] One passenger was killed unintentionally.
