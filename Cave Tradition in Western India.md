	- In western India, many Buddhist caves dating back to the second century BCE onwards have been excavated. Mainly three architectural types were executed—
	- (i) apsidal vault-roof chaitya halls (found at Ajanta, Pitalkhora, Bhaja);
	- (ii) apsidal vault-roof pillarless hall (found at Thana-Nadsur in Maharashtra); and
	- (iii) flat-roofed quadrangular hall with a circular chamber at the back (found at Kondivite in Maharashtra). The front of the chaitya hall is dominated by the motif of a semi-circular chaitya arch with an open front which has a wooden facade and, in some cases, there is no dominating chaitya arch window such as found at Kondivite. In all the chaitya caves a stupa at the back is common.

- In the first century BCE some modifications were made to the standard plan of the apsidal vault-roof variety where the hall becomes rectangular like at Ajanta Cave No. 9 with a stone-screen wall as a facade. It is also found at Bedsa, Nashik, Karla and Kanheri. Many cave sites have the standard first type of chaitya halls in the subsequent period. In Karla, the biggest rock-cut chaitya hall was excavated. The cave consists of an open courtyard with two pillars, a stone screen wall to protect from rain, a veranda, a stone-screen wall as facade, an apsidal vault-roof chaitya hall with pillars, and a stupa at the back. Karla chaitya hall is decorated with human and animal figures. They are heavy in their execution, and move in the picture space. Further elaboration over the Karla chaitya hall plan is observed at Kanheri Cave No.3. Though the cave’s interior was not fully finished, it shows how the carving progressed from [[time]] to time. Subsequently, the quadrangular flat-roofed variety became the most preferred design and is extensively found at many places.

- The viharas are excavated in all the cave sites. The plan of the viharas consists of a veranda, a hall and cells around the walls of the hall. Some of the important vihara caves are Ajanta Cave No. 12, Bedsa Cave No. 11, Nashik Cave Nos. 3, 10 and 17. Many of the early vihara caves are carved with interior decorative motifs like chaitya arches and the vedica designs over the cell doors of the cave. Facade design in Nashik Cave Nos. 3, 10, and 17 became a distinct achievement. The vihara caves at Nashik were excavated with front pillars carved with ghata-base and ghata-capital with human figures. One such vihara cave was also excavated at Junnar in Maharashtra, which is popularly known as [[Ganeshleni]] because an image of Ganesha belonging to a later period was installed in it. Later, a stupa was added at the back of the hall of the vihara and it became a chaitya vihara.

- The stupas in the fourth and fifth centuries CE have Buddha images attached. [[Junnar]] has the largest cave excavations— more than two hundred caves around the hills of the town— whereas Kanheri in Mumbai has a hundred and eight excavated caves. The most important sites are Ajanta, Pitalkhora, Ellora, Nashik, Bhaja, Junnar, Karla, Kanheri. Ajanta, Ellora, and Kanheri continue to flourish.
