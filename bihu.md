most important festival in [[Assam]].
It is celebrated with joy and abundance by all Assamese people irrespective of caste, creed, religion, faith, and belief.
It can be broadly divided into three categories: Bohag Bihu which augurs the wish for a good harvest because this is the time when farmers start sowing, Kaati Bihu which is observed to mark the cutting and binding of grains and Magh Bihu which marks the season of harvesting of grains.
Tribal groups like the Mishings, the Deoris, and the Morans celebrate Bihu with dances of their distinctive style.
