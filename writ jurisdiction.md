The Constitution has constituted the Supreme Court as the guarantor and defender of the fundamental rights of the citizens-
The Supreme Court is empowered to issue writs including habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of an aggrieved citizen.
The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is original but not exclusive as it is shared with High courts_
