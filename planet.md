- : All planets orbit around the [[sun]] in a counter-clockwise direction.
- Earth has the highest density with density of 5.517 gm/cm3 . Second highest is [[mercury]] with density of 5.44 gm/cm3
- [[mercury]] 和 [[venus]] 不 有 any satellite
- All planets have density above density of water (1 gm/cm3 ), except [[Saturn]] (0.7 gm/cm3 ). So if [[Saturn]] is placed in a very large pool of water, it will float, while all other planets will sink.
- planetesimals
	-  are a large [[number]] of smaller bodies formed from dust, rock, and other materials existed at an early stage of the Planet formation. In the final stage, these large [[number]] of small planetesimals accrete to form a fewer large bodies in the form of planets.
	- The Terrestrial and Jovian planets are separated by an [[asteroid belt]]. But the [[asteroid belt]] has no such property as to provide a shield to the Jovian planets against Solar winds.
	- Large distance from the Sun plays a big role as due to distance, the intensity of Solar winds is not so strong and the Since these planets (jovian) are relatively far from the sun, the [[temperature]] here is lower. Because of this, there were more planetesimals which resulted in larger planets. However, the greater percent of the planetesimals in the outer solar system would be composed of ices (hydrogen and helium). These ices didn‘t form in the inner solar system because it is too hot there. Since different elements have different condensation temperatures, ices could not form until the particles were in a much cooler part of the disk, and therefore much further from the [[Sun]]. The [[temperature]] of the gas affects the condensation of the elements in the gas. If the gas were cooler when condensation began, particles now common in the outer solar system would also be common in the inner solar system. That is why Jovian planets are able to hold large quantities of gas.
	- Unlike the terrestrial planets, the Jovian planets are large and their higher gravity allows them to hold the escaping gases.

- [[dwarf planet]]
- : Some planets, such as [[mercury]], [[Venus]], and [[jupiter]], have axes that are almost completely perpendicular, or straight up-and-down. Earth's axis is not perpendicular. It has an [[axial tilt]], or obliquity. *[[uranus]] has the largest [[axial tilt]] in the solar system*. Its axis is tilted about 98 degrees, so its north pole is nearly on its [[equator]].
