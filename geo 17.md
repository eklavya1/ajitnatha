geography class 17

a brief revision of previous class

types of chemical weathering

hydrolysis: it's chemical union of water & minerals. it involves a specific chemical change in which new material is produced.
hydration: it occurs when minerals incorporate water into their molecular structure. it causes swelling.
oxidation-reduction: it's addition or removal of oxygen & causes discoloration. they are 1st visible signs of chemical weathering.
carbonation: rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it falls through air & gets converted into carbonic acid. limestones & dolomites are altered by dissolving actions of carbonic acid.

biological weathering

it involves breakdown of particles by burrowing animals & pressure exerted by plant roots.
decomposing organic matter releases a diff chemical which may increase rate of weathering.
reactions with minerals by organisms may bring changes in rocks.

erosion

it refers to wearing away of land surface by mechanical actions of debris derived from weathering as they are transported to diff locations by agents like water, wind, glaciers, etc.
diff types of erosion
abrasion: wearing away of surfaces by mechanical processes like rubbing, scratching, polishing, etc. abrasion if it's happening in water, is c/a corrosion.
attrition: it involves a reduction in size of fragments by friction & impact during transportation. it breaks down load into finer sediments.
corrosion: it involves wearing away of particles by solvent & chemical actions of water.
cavitation: collapse of bubbles of water in rivers leads to explosion sending a shock wave, which stands to disintegrate adjacent rocks.
deflation: lifting & removal of dust & sand by wind. it involves aerial erosion removing unconsolidated material.
hydraulic action: breaking away of rocks by fast-moving waters is c/a hydraulic action.
plucking: as glaciers move they drag rocks & disintegrate into smaller pieces.

mass movements

mass in movement under influence of gravity is c/a mass movement or mass wasting.
weathered material can move along downhill slopes under influence of gravity with or without assistance of running water is c/a a mass movement.
slow mass movements
creep: it's slow downhill movement of soil & weathered mantle occurring along slopes. it's difficult to notice but it's a continuous movement.
solifluction: it involves slow movement of soil mixed with water, as a viscous fluid that is more active in glacier regions.
rapid mass movements
landslides: it's movement of cross-section of hill slopes under influence of gravity. material maintains continuous contact with surface as it moves.
earth flow: earth flows from on terraces & hillsides, where they are capable of flowage when saturated with water that occurs beneath earth layer.
mudflow: it involves rapid movement of masses of uncompacted soil that is suddenly saturated with water.
rockslide: it's rapid movement of rock material along mountain slopes.
rockfall: it involves falling of rocks in a vertical direction along cliffs & mountain regions.
