# How to Tell if a Large Number is Prime?
- if it ends with 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8, it is not a prime number.
- Numbers whose sum of digits are divisible by 3 are **never** prime numbers
- Step 3: After confirming the falsity of steps 1 and 2, find the square root of the given number.
- Step 4: Divide the given number by all the prime numbers below its square root value.
- Step 5: If the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers less than its square root, it is not a prime number; otherwise, it is prime.
