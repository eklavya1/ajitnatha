Hinayana, ("Lesser Vehicle") is the more orthodox, conservative school of Buddhism.
The school includes the followers of the original preaching of the Buddha.
They do not believe in idol or image worship of Buddha.
They believe in individual salvation and try to attain individual salvation through self-discipline and meditation.
The ultimate aim of Hinayana is thus Nirvana.
