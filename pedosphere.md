The pedosphere (from Greek πέδον pedon "ground" or "earth" & σφαῖρα sphaira "sphere") is outermost layer of [[Earth]] that is composed of soil & subject to soil formation processes. It exists at interface of [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]] & [[biosphere]]. pedosphere is skin of Earth & only develops when there is a dynamic interaction between atmosphere (air in & above soil), biosphere (living organisms), lithosphere (unconsolidated regolith & consolidated bedrock) & hydrosphere (water in, on & below soil). pedosphere is foundation of terrestrial life on Earth.

The pedosphere acts as mediator of chemical & biogeochemical flux into & out of these respective systems & is made up of gaseous, mineralic, fluid & biologic components. pedosphere lies within Critical Zone, a broader interface that includes vegetation, pedosphere, groundwater aquifer systems, regolith & finally ends at some depth in bedrock where biosphere & hydrosphere cease to make significant changes to chemistry at depth. As part of larger global system, any particular environment in which soil forms is influenced solely by its geographic position on globe as climatic, geologic, biologic & anthropogenic changes occur with changes in longitude & latitude.

The pedosphere lies below vegetative cover of biosphere & above hydrosphere & lithosphere. soil forming process (pedogenesis) can begin without aid of biology but is significantly quickened in presence of biologic reactions, where it forms a soil carbon sponge. Soil formation begins with chemical and/or physical breakdown of minerals to form initial material that overlies bedrock substrate. Biology quickens this by secreting acidic compounds that help break rock apart. Particular biologic pioneers are lichen, mosses & seed bearing plants, but many other inorganic reactions take place that diversify chemical makeup of early soil layer. Once weathering & decomposition products accumulate, a coherent soil body allows migration of fluids both vertically & laterally through soil profile, causing ion exchange between solid, fluid & gaseous phases. As time progresses, bulk geochemistry of soil layer will deviate away from initial composition of bedrock & will evolve to a chemistry that reflects type of reactions that take place in soil.
