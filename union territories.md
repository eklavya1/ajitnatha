In 1956 'union territories' were constituted by the 7th Constitutional Amendment Act (1956) and the States Reorganisation Act (1956).
Articles 239 to 241 in Part VIII of the Constitution deal with the union territories and there is no uniformity in their administrative system.
	Every union territory is administered by the President through an administrator appointed by him.
	The administrator of a union territory is an agent of the Central govemment and is not the head of state like a governor.
	The President can also appoint the governor of a state as the administrator of an adjoining union territory.
	Not all the UT's have an administrator, some are directly govemed by the president.
The Parliament can make laws on any subject of the three lists (including the State List) for the union territories.
The Centre's Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal ministry for all things concerning Union Territories, including legislation, money and budget, services, and the appointment of Administrators.
It is not an autonomous unit but is managed by administrators appointed by India's President.
