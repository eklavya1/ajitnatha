- The marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) refers to the *minimum interest rate of a bank below which it cannot lend*, except in some cases allowed by the [[RBI]].
- It is an internal benchmark or reference rate for the bank.
- MCLR actually describes the method by which the minimum interest rate for loans is determined by a bank - on the basis of marginal cost or the additional or incremental cost of arranging one more rupee for the prospective borrower.
- The MCLR methodology for fixing interest rates for advances was introduced by the Reserve Bank of India with effect from [[April]] 1, [[2016]].
- This new methodology replaces the base rate system introduced in July [[2010]].
