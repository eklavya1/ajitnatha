- in meteorology, an occluded front is a type of weather front formed during cyclogenesis. the classical and usual view of an occluded front is that it initiates when a cold front overtakes a warm front near a cyclone, such that the warm air is separated (occluded) from the cyclone center at the surface. the point where the warm front becomes the occluded front is the triple point; a new area of low-pressure that develops at this point is called a triple-point low. a more modern view of the formation process suggests that occluded fronts form directly without the influence of other fronts during the wrap-up of the baroclinic zone during cyclogenesis, and then lengthen due to flow deformation and rotation around the cyclone as the cyclone forms.
