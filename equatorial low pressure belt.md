This belt is characterized by extremely low pressure with calm conditions.
This is because of the absence of Surface winds since winds approaching this belt to begin to rise near its margin. Thus, only vertical currents are found.
As the larger part of the low-pressure belt passes along the oceans, the winds obtain a huge amount of moisture.
Vertical winds (convection) carry moisture from cumulonimbus clouds and lead to thunderstorms (convectional rainfall).
In spite of high temperatures, cyclones are not formed at the equator because of 'zero' Coriolis force.
The sun shines almost vertically on the equator throughout the year.
As a result, the air gets warm and rises over the equatorial region, and produces equatorial low pressure.
This belt extends from the equator to 100 N and 10 0 S latitudes.
Due to excessive heating horizontal movement of air is absent here and only conventional currents are there.
Therefore this belt is called doldrums (the zone of calm) due to the virtual absence of surface winds.
These are the regions of convergence because the winds flowing from subtropical high-pressure belts converge here.
This belt is also known as-Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).
