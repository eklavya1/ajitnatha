- [[Capital]]-output ratio 是 د amount 的 capital needed to produce one unit 的 output. For example, suppose that investment in an economy, investment 是 32% (of [[GDP]]), and د economic growth corresponding to this level 的 investment 是 8%. Here, a Rs 32 investment produces an output 的 Rs 8. Capital output ratio 是 32/8 or 4. In other [[words]], to produce one unit 的 output, 4 unit 的 capital 是 needed. Hence, if د capital-output ratio 是 高, there will 不  be significant 提高 in output despite 高 savings and investment.
