revision of previous class through questions (tombolo, arranging landforms cataract, rapid, waterfall, depositional features, etc)

climatology

important topics:
planetary winds
tropical & temperate cyclones
climatic regions (most important)-> to be done from gc leong
weather & climate
climate is average atmospheric conditions of area over a considerable period of time.
it's calculated for a minimum period of 30 years.
climate includes factors of rainfall, temperature, humidity, air pressure, winds, etc.
weather is a day-to-day state of atmosphere.

atmosphere

it's layer of air surrounding earth held by gravity.
it's a thick gaseous envelope that surrounds earth from all sides & is attached to earth's surface by gravitational force.

composition of atmosphere

nitrogen - 78.8%
oxygen- 20.95%
argon-0.93%
carbon dioxide-0.036%
neon-0.002%
nitrogen -
it's 1 of essential elements required in formation of organic molecules
it's required in dna, rna, proteins. it's not chemically very active. 
oxygen -
chemically active it has capacity to react with many other compounds;
it's released through photosynthesis & is consumed by both plants & animals through respiration 
carbon dioxide -
it's absorbed by plants during photosynthesis,
it can hold heat very easily for a longer duration that's why it's c/a a greenhouse gas 
noble gases -
c/a noble because they are not reactive 
ex of noble gases -argon, neon, krypton, helium, xenon
water vapour -
it's nothing but water in gaseous form 
water vapour is cause of all weather phenomenon clouds, rains, precipitation, rate of evaporation etc 
water vapour is mainly concentrated in lower 16km of earth atmosphere 
water vapour is also a greenhouse gas as it can absorb & hold heat
dust particles -
these are tiny minute elements suspended in air, limited only to lower layers they are originating from arid regions & volcanic eruptions 
it's hygroscopic in nature - means having capacity to absorb moisture & helps in condensation & formation of clouds 
they are concentrated in subtropical & tropical regions. 

structure of atmosphere

homosphere & heteropshere
homosphere 	heterosphere
extends up to 80 km 	above 80 km
gases are uniformly mixed 	diff layer of each gas
gases appear in molecular form 	in atomic form
high concentration of water & dust particular 	no/very low concentration of water & dust particular

has 3 layers troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere 


has thermosphere, exosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere 

troposphere 

it's lowermost layer of atmosphere 
it's also c/a a zone of turbulence & a zone of convection. 
75% of gases in atmosphere are concentrated in troposphere.
all weather phenomenon will take place in troposphere due to water vapour & dust particles 
it extends from sea level to 16 km along tropics & up to 6 km along poles 
here temperature decreases gradually as we move away from surface till end of troposphere.
tropopause is boundary b/w tropopause & stratosphere where temperature starts to increase & is c/a a temperature inversion layer. mixing of gases stops here.

stratosphere 

it extends from tropopause to up to 50 km
strato means layers, here gases are arranged in diff layers & are stratified & non-convective in nature. 
temperature rises in stratosphere due to absorption of uv rays by ozone which is concentrated b/w 35- 5o km 
conditions here are extremely dry, except rare clouds are formed here c/a mother of pearl & nacreous clouds, which are stratospheric clouds.
strapooause is top of stratosphere & zone of temperature inversion, 

mesosphere 

it extends from stratopause to 80 km
here temperature decreases with height & reaches -100 degree at 80 km which is lowest in atmosphere 
top of mesosphere is mesopause

thermosphere 

it extends from 80km to 700km.
it consists of a lower nitrogen layer from 80 to 200km.
temperature rises rapidly due to absorption of high energy solar radiation 
however, heat is not felt due to absence of molecular collision 

exosphere 

it extends 500-700km to end of atmosphere 
it contains helium, atomic oxygen, & hydrogen 
it contains a magnetosphere which is composed of electrons & protons derived from solar winds & other charged particles
they are arranged in 2 bands at 3000km & 16000 km which is c/a vann allen radiation belts.
auroras are produced in this region near poles. 
within this layer, we have another layer c/a ionosphere

ionosphere

it extends from 80 km to 650 km 
it's formed due to ionisation by solar radiation 
it's made up of diff layers such as d, e, f, g 
ionosphere reflects shortwave radio waves back to earth which helps in radio communication.

insolation 

amount of incoming solar radiation is c/a insolation
amount of insolation received is 2 billionth of solar energy.
it's equal to 1.92 cal/cm²/min which is c/a solar constant
incoming solar radiation is shorter in wavelength & this radiation is absorbed by earth surface & is re-emitted as longwave radiation c/a terrestrial radiation 
atmosphere is transparent to incoming solar radiation & opaque to outgoing radiation 
warming of earth surface by some of gases is c/a as green house effect & gases responsible for this effect is c/a green house gases,
for ex- carbon dioxide, methane, sulphur hexafluoride, water vapour, hydrofluorocarbon, etc.
since earth surface absorbs incoming solar radiation & emits terrestrial radiation it acts as a source of heat from atmosphere, therefore, temperature decreases with height which is c/a a normal lapse rate.
normal lapse rate is 6.5 degrees/km.

methods of heat transfer

radiation:
it involves transfer of heat in form of radiant energy.
for ex, incoming solar radiation is in form of electromagnetic radiation 
conduction:
it's transfer of heat through molecular activity at zone of contact.
ex: transfer of heat b/w troposphere & earth surface 
convection:
it's transfer of heat by vertical movement of mass/air. 
ex - convection of air along equator 
advection: 
it's transfer of heat by horizontal movement of mass/air.
ex - planetary winds & ocean currents
