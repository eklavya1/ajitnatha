Security Class 06

## Challenges created by Media into India's Internal Security
Challenges created by Media into India's Internal Security:
1:12 PM:

1. Sensationalization of News, eg. Hijacking of IC814 created a panic amongst the policymakers, political leaders, it is a threat to national security issues
2. Trivialization of national security issues = in the name of national news debates on the news channels, it can lead to a situation where the decision would be influenced by populous demand
3. Irressponisble coverage of anti-terror operations eg, 26/11 attacks were covered irresponsibly led to damage to the operation, hot pursuit/surgical strike of Indian Army into Myanmar when they are chasing insurgents of NCN-(K), putting their lives in threat by relieving their identity.
4. Irresponsible Coverage of communal issue/conflict = news channel deliberately try to identify the rioters, trouble mongers, with one or the other specific community.
5. Irresponsible coverage of victims of terrorist Attacks/heinous crimes = further spreading the terror and helping the terrorist achieve their objectives by showing such news
6. Paid News = tool to justify entry of criminals into politics, glorification of criminals, extremists

## Positive Roles of Media
2:09 PM: Positive Roles of Media:

1. Role Played by Indian Media Agencies during the Kargil war:
Because of this, we were able to turn the opinion of the international community in favor of India. 
2. The role played by the media after the shooting down of the Pakistan navy Petrol plane by the Indian Air Force in Aug 1999, Indian media swayed the opinion of ICJ and the global community in India's Favor.
3. Role played by Media in ensuring Communal Harmoney: a number of journalists were part of Track-2 and Track-3 diplomacy initiatives to normalize the relationship with Pakistan.
4. Role in busting the fake news and propaganda of extremists = Media have been a crucial partner for the govt in busting the fake news and propaganda of extremists

## Various Security Agencies and their Mandate
Various Security Agencies and their Mandate:

Security Agencies can be divided into - 
a) Enforcement Agencies = the armed forces (defense production, organizational setup, integrated theatre command), CAPF, State Police
b) Intelligence Agencies = RAW, IB, NTRO
c) Investigating Agencies = NIA, CBI
3:15 PM: Issues related to Functioning of Intelligence Agencies of India:
IB = established by the Britishers against the Indian freedom fighters, till 1968 major responsibility was to provide all the kinds of intelligence inputs to the govt and various security agencies including the armed forces with respect to internal security as well as any external threats,
Intelligence has objectives of preventive and offensive, after 1968 - IB comes under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will focus on internal threats, and RAW comes under Prim Minister Office (PMO) will focus on external threats from outside
NTRO is created in 2004 with the objective of providing technical intelligence inputs, is under control of PMO
Issues = No role is defined of these agencies in any law, they have been created through an executive order, they have overlapping functions, they also have ego-tussles, IB is used for spying on political adversaries by the govt in power, 
1. Overlapping functions = it leads to ineffective and inefficiency in their functions, duplication in efforts, setting accountability becomes difficult
2. Lack of legislative oversight often leads to the political misuse of these agencies by the executive.
3. Turf War between various intelligence agencies
4. Shortage of workforce = specifically technical workforce (cyber security experts, forensic experts, etc.)
5. Lack of R&D on the technical intelligence front as well as a shortage of resources.
Reforms Needed:
1. Must be provided the legal framework
2. Reforms in their recruitment and training process
3. Broad-based recruitment framework including experts from outside
4. Bring all of them under one leader who will be supervising and control on them
5. Promotion of transparency and accountability
6. Empowerment of intelligence officials, autonomy in exercising powers

## Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF)
3:57 PM: Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF):

To supplement the law and order issues in the state, eg the issue of Naxalism
sometimes also called as Paramilitary Forces = like Assam Rifles, Indian Coast Guard, 
Various CAPF = CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF, SSB, NSG
