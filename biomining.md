Biomining is the process of using microorganisms (microbes) to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste.
Biomining techniques may also be used to clean up sites that have been polluted with metals.
It is usually used for old dumped waste that remains in a partly or fully decomposed state with no segregation in existence between wet and dry waste.
In the cost-effective method of biomining, treatment is done by dividing the garbage heap at the site into suitable blocks to let the air percolate in the heap.
As a result, the leachate which is the water in the heap with suspended solid particles is drained off and microbes are sprayed in the heap to initiate biological decompositions.
The waste is turned over several times in order to devoid the waste to leachate as much as possible.
This biological decomposition of the waste decreases the volume of the waste by 40%.
This is the basic process behind most biomining, which is used for metals that can be more easily recovered when dissolved than from solid rocks. Metals currently bio mined are copper, uranium, nickel, and gold that are commonly found in sulfidic (sulfur-bearing) minerals.
For metals that are not dissolved by microbes, different techniques using microbes to break down the surrounding material are used.
