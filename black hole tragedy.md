	-  Fort William was besieged on 15 June 1756 by Nawab [[Siraj-ud-Daulah]]. Following the normal practices of war, English at Calcutta which included some [[women]] and children were lodged in a prison room of the fort. The [[number]] of prisoners is given out as 146 and the dimensions of the prison as 18 feet long by 14 feet 10 inches wide. Out of 146 white prisoners were shut up on 20th June only 23 survived the next morning when the prison room was opened, the rest having trampled one other down for places near the window.
	-  The `East India` authorities used the episode as a propaganda device to malign the Nawab and won support of the British public opinion for the war of aggression.
