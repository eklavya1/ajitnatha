## Kepplerâ€™s Laws of planetary motion

- He gave three laws of planetary motion.
- First Law: All planets revolve around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun being at one of the foci of the ellipse.
- Second Law: Planets sweep the equal area in equal time. This is the consequence of the conservation of the angular momentum.
- Third Law: The square of the planetâ€™s orbital time period of the revolution is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse.
- Properties of the ellipse: the sum of the distance between two foci will be always constant. Major axis and minor axis.
- T = r*m*v (r= radius, m= mass, v= velocity)
- P = m*v
- If a torque on a system is zero, its angular momentum will be conserved.

## Newtonâ€™s Laws

Law of Gravitation: If there are two objects mass m1 and m2 and separated by r. Then the gravitation force, F= G m1*m2/r2. G is the gravitational constant. It is equal to 6.67*10 to the power -11.
Concept of vector and scalar. For the vector, the magnitude, as well as the direction of the magnitude, applied matters. Scalar will be always in the magnitude only.
Examples of the vector will be displacement, velocity, acceleration, forces, and torques. Examples of the scalar are mass, density, volume, distance, speed, etc.
In an elliptical orbit, the speed and velocity, are not constant. In a circular orbit, the speed is constant but velocity is not constant as direction is always changing.
In the case of the planets and satellites we launch, the force that is responsible for the circular motion is gravity.
Escape velocity: It is the speed at which an object must travel to break free of the planetâ€™s gravitational force.
First Law of Newton: An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at a constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
Second Law of Newton: The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.
Third Law of Newton: Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first.
The objects in the circular path want to remain in their steady motion.
Centripetal Force: It is a net force that acts on objects to keep them moving along a circular path. In the case of the motion of satellites around the earth or the sun, the required centripetal force comes from gravity.

## Types of Orbit for the Satellite
(2:19 PM)

- An orbit is a curved path of a celestial object or an artificial satellite around another celestial object due to the force of gravity.

- Classification based on height

- It is classified under three categories.
- Low Earth Orbit that varies between 150 to 2000 Km.
- Medium Earth Orbit is between 2000 to 35780 Km.
- Geosynchronous and High Earth Orbit that revolved at Greater than 35786 Km.
- Space is defined above 100 Km of the Earth Surface. The line is known as the Karman Line.
- The lower Earth Orbit is generally used for Earth Observation.
- Medium Earth Orbits are generally used for the navigation
- High Earth Orbits are generally used for communication.

## Classification based on the shape
(2:57 PM)

Elliptical and Circular Orbit.
The elliptical is the norm and the Circular is the exception.
Some polar orbits have circular orbits.

## Classification based on the inclination

Inclination with the equatorial plane. It could be classified under three categories
equatorial orbit, polar orbit, and inclined other orbits.
Launching at the polar is difficult as compared to equatorial orbit as for the polar orbit the launch does not get the Earth rotational momentum.
Most of the launches are from the Eastern Coast. As the Earth rotates from the west to east, thus launching from the eastern coast to the eastwards direction gets the angular momentum from the Earth rotational thrust.
Besides that east coast provides safety from the falling of the rocket on the mainland in case of failure of it or the lower parts of rockets that fall back on the earth.

## Classification of orbits based on the Earthâ€™s Motion

Geosynchronous Orbit: In such orbits, the earth's rotation is synchronized with the satellite's revolution. Such satellites complete one orbit in one sidereal day (23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds) at an altitude of 35786 Km.
Geo-stationary Orbits is a special case of geosynchronous orbit that is circular and the orbit is in the earthâ€™s equatorial plane. It stays over the same points of the earthâ€™s equator. These orbits are generally used for communication and surveillance. It is also used for the earthâ€™s observation.
Sun Synchronous Orbit: It is due to satellite revolution around Earth.
Geostationary orbits orbit is very crowded. International Telecommunications Union (ITU) regulated this orbit for the satellite launches in the geostationary and geosynchronous orbits.
In the equatorial plain this satellite is orbiting. Any other orbit that has the same characters but not at the equatorial plane is known as the geosynchronous orbit.
Geosynchronous orbit does even not seem to be fixed above the earth, however more or less it will seem like that satellite at geosynchronous is oscillating around the fixed position on the earth. For a significant time, the alignment with the geosynchronous satellite will be not lost.

## Geostationary Transfer Orbit
(3:45 PM)

To attain geosynchronous and geostationary orbit a spacecraft is first launched into a highly elliptical orbit with an apogee of about 36000 Km.
Perigee can be as less as 400Km. When the spacecraft reaches the apogee it is given the boost to inject it into the desired orbit.
These temporary orbits are called the geo-transfer orbit.

The topic for the next class discussion: Sun-synchronous orbit, Launch Vehicles.
