ambergris, which means gray amber in french, is a waxy substance that originates from digestive system of protected sperm whales.
while it's incorrectly referred to as 'whale vomit,' 1 of theories about its formation suggests that it's produced in gastrointestinal tract of some of sperm whales for the passage of hard, sharp objects that are ingested when whale eats large quantities of marine animals.
traditionally, ambergris is used to produce perfumes that have notes of musk.
while there are records of it being used to flavor food, alcoholic beverages tobacco in some cultures in past, it's rarely used for these purposes presently.
trade sale of ambergris are banned in nearly 40 countries.
while there is a ban on possession trade of ambergris in countries like usa, australia india, in several other countries it's a tradable commodity, though with limitations in
some of them.
in indian context, sperm whales are a protected species under schedule 2 of wildlife protection act possession or trade of any of its by-products, including
ambergris its byproducts, is illegal under provisions of wildlife protection act, 1972.
