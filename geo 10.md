# summary	
a brief revision of previous class 

## rocks vs minerals
3 important types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, & metamorphic
foliation, lineation, etc & rock cycle
geomorphic processes: endogenetic force & exogenetic forces

## types of endogentic movements
(continued)

### sudden movement
sudden movements are shorter in duration & are unpredictable. they can be observed by human beings.
eg: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions
### diastrophic movements
these movements operate very slowly, but continuously & results in formation of primary landforms. these movements move, elevate or build up portions of earth's crust. 
types of diastrophic movements: tectonic, isostatic, & eustatic

### tectonic movements
word 'tekton' means builder in greek
these are continent & mountain building movements affecting earth's surface.

they include epirogenic & orogenic 

epirogenic movements
these are vertical movements caused by radial forces.
they are characterized by large-scale upliftment/emergence or subsidence/submergence of land areas. 
they are very slow & widespread. 
these movements lead to a continental building.  eg: slow subsidence of northern coast of gulf of mexico, upliftment of deccan plateau.  

orogenic movements
these are mountain-building movements caused by tangential forces.
they involve intense folding, thrusting, & faulting of narrow belts.
2 types of orogenic movements: compressional & tensional.

compressional forces:
these are forces causing earth's rocks to push or squeeze against each other causing formation of folds. 
folds are structures in which layers are bent or distorted without loss of continuity.

tensional forces:
they are forces that pull rocks apart & cause formation of faults.
faults are fractures by which primary surfaces are broken & displaced losing their continuity. 

# folds
sides of a fold are c/a limbs.
upfolds are c/a anticlines which are formed when strata/layer is bent upwards.
downfolds are c/a synclines where strata are bent downwards.

types of folds:

## symmetrical fold
if limbs of a fold are inclined at same angle, it's c/a a symmetrical fold.

## asymmetric fold
if 1 of limbs is inclined more than other, it's c/a asymmetrical fold.
overfold- it's a fold where strata in 1 limb have been folded beyond vertical.
recumbent fold- it's a fold literally lying down resulting from continuation of pressure on 1 of limbs. 
nappe- pressure exerted upon a recumbent fold is sufficiently great to cause it to be torn from its roots & thrust forward. 

# faults
in a block, down-dropped portion of a fault is c/a graben or rift.
upthrust block is c/a horst. 
types of fault

### normal fault
when 1 of blocks moves downward relative to other due to tensional force pulling blocks apart is c/a normal fault or dip slip fault.

### reverse fault
when 1 block moves up in relation to other 1 due to compressional force. it results in reverse fault or a thrust fault.

### strike-slip fault
it's also c/a transform fault, where both blocks move across each other involving no vertical movements. eg: san andreas fault. 

## difference b/w fold & block mountains

**fold mountains**                           	                        **block mountains**
it's because of folding process. 	           due to faulting process
continuity 	                                                          discontinuity.
only compressional force 	                              both compressional & tension force
gradient 	                                                          steep
taller 	                                                              wider
eg: himalayan, alps 	                                          eg: blackforest (germany)

## isostatic movements

isostasy is state of equilibrium or balance in earth's crust.
isostatic movements involve vertical movements under action of floatation displacement b/w rock layers of differing density & mobility.
this is to achieve balanced crustal columns of uniform mass above a level of compensation in which topographic elevation is inversely related to underlying rock density.
ex: mountains will have deep roots, scandinavian mountains over norway coast.
melting of ice sheets along scandinavian mountains has led to gradual rising of land which is evident in a series of raised beaches. 

## eustatic movements

they involve worldwide movement of sea level resulting from changes in total volume of liquid seawater or capacity of ocean basins.
ex: convection in mantle would arch up oceanic ridge & displace water from ocean basins as capacity of basins decreases. 

# continental drift theory

proposed by alfred wegner in 1912
during carboniferous period (250 million years ago), there was only 1 supercontinent (pangea) & a single ocean (panthalassa)-> explained through images--> dictation will be provided in next class. 

topic for next class: further discussion on cdt
# assignment
what are diff types of folds? also bring out difference b/w folds & faults. (150 words/10 marks)
