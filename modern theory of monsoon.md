#quran - 2|39|وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ

# winter
1. low [[temperature]] & high [[pressure]] conditions result in anti cyclonic circulations
2. [[wind]]s blow outwards from the [[land]] over which the [[air]] is subsiding. the winds are dry & cold
3. the subtropical westerlies jetstream is strong & well-estd. it is bifurcated into 2 branches over north & south of [[tibet]]an [[plateau]].
4. the southern branch is stronger & is located along northern ganga plains
5. this intensifies surface anti-cyclones leading to clear & dry sky weather
6. the winds blow from [[land]] to [[sea]] in northeast direction
7. northeast winds after crossing [[bay of bengal]] pick up moisture & causes [[precipitation]] along [[koromandal]] coast _related_ [[tamil nadu]] | [[sangam 岁 சங்ககாலம்]] | [[Prisoners of Geography]] [[economic geography]]
# spring
1. weather is hot & dry
2. the subtropical jetstream begins to weaken & the southern branch eventually moves entirely to the north of tibetan plateau
3. temp starts to rise further & pressure falls, these conditions lead to convection in some places resulting in precipitation c/a `pre-monsoon showers`,
	- ex - `mango showers` in [[kerala]] & [[karnataka]] helps in early ripening of mango
	- cherry blossom / blossom showers in [[kerala]] & [[karnataka]] helps in [[coffee]] flowering
	- northwestern ( #doubt ) or kalbaisakhi or bardoli cheera ????odissa, w bengal, assam & bihar ---> useful for jute, rice & tea cultivation
	- northern plains - loo (hot and dry wind)
# summer
1. the complete development of low pressure cell over desert in northern plains causes [[ITCZ]] to shift completely north & to lie over the northern plains
2. this shift attracts the southern [[trade 风]] towards the north of [[equator]]
3. after crossing the equator, the trade winds turn right under the influ of [[coriolis force]] & start to blow as `southwest monsoon winds`
4. the temp stratification in the air does not allow the upward movement of air preventing major storms
5. the tropical easterly jetstream which develop over [[india]] in summers helps in the formation of disturbance in the air. this along with the monsoon depressions in the bay of bengal causes the `bursting of monsoon`
	- bursting- the sudden onset of moisture-ladden winds associated with violent thunder & lightning
6. these monsoon winds gradually get distributed all throught india causing `monsoon rainfall`
7. in some regions due to local stability conditions temperature stratification reappears resulting in break in the monsoon. it might also be due to the winds blowing parallel to [[topography]]
# autumn
- retreating monsoon
1. [[ITCZ]] starts to move back gradually towards the south
2. this also brings back the maximum extent to which southwest winds blow
3. the SW winds slowly gets replaced by NE winds
4. the subtropical westerly jetstream reappears to the south of tibetan plateau creating dry conditions
5. occasionally high temp & dry conditions4 co-exist in [[october]] along the northern plains c/a `october heat`
