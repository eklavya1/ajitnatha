It is the largest freshwater lake in North East [[India]].
Loktak Lake is fed by the [[Manipur]] river and several tributaries and 'Ungamel Channel' (Ithai Barrage) is its only outlet now.
Keibul Lamjao national park- the only floating national park in the world lies in the lake.
The national park is the last habitat of endangered Sangai deer also called dancing [[deer]].
The lake is famous for Phumdis- floating mass of entangled vegetation formed by the accumulation of organic debris and biomass with soil.
