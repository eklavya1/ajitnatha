- • The civil Disobedience movement  popularized a variety of forms of mobilization such as
 - ◦ Patrikas, or illegal news sheets, sometimes written by hand were part of the strategy to defy the hated [[Press 行为]]
 - ◦ Magic lanterns which were used to take the nationalist message to the villages
 - ◦ Children were organized into vanar senas or monkey armies
 - • Another unique mode using music was Prabhat Pheris. These were morning processions where groups of ten to fifteen people assembled to sing songs – mostly patriotic ones – in the 1930s. They were more popular in Bombay and other parts of western India.

 - • These musical groups were loosely attached to the Congress organization but for the most part, were informal and independent until in September 1930 they organized themselves into the Akhil Bharat Pheri Sangh with its headquarters in Congress House.
 - • `Their activities slowly grew in scale so much so that the British police authorities identified them as a potential threat to civic order`. The groups themselves simply sang either from memory or from printed sheets and pamphlets, but the government saw the printed matter as seditious material.
 
 - • After the Gandhi-Irwin pact when political prisoners were released the Prabhat Pheris changed tack as they adopted songs in praise of constructive work and social reform, making it difficult for the administration to come down on them.
 - • On 25 May 1931, when Gandhi was asked to discourage the Prabhat Pheris, he wrote that he found nothing objectionable in them as they were innocent and did nothing to disturb the peace.
 - • Gandhi saw music as a valuable resource in channelizing the right fervour or commitment, he saw Prabhat Pheris as a medium for sponsoring a constructive programme of civic virtue.
