The Trade winds or easterlies are the permanent east-to-west prevailing winds that flow in the Earth's equatorial region.
o The Trade winds can be found about 30 degrees north and south of the equator.
o The Trade winds blow mainly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere, strengthening during the winter
and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase.
o The Trade winds are created by a cycle of warm, moist air rising near the equator. The air eventually cools and sinks a bit further north in the tropics. This
phenomenon is called the Hadley cell.
o Since these winds blow from subtropical latitudes to the warmer tropics, they have a great capacity for holding moisture.
• In their passage across the open oceans, they gather more moisture and bring heavy rainfall to the eastern coasts of continents within the
tropics. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
• As they are offshore on the west coast, these regions suffer from great aridity and form the Trade wind hot deserts of the world, like Sahara, Kalahari,
Atacama, etc.
o It is stronger and more consistent over the oceans than over land and often produces partly cloudy sky conditions, characterized by shallow cumulus clouds, or
clear skies that make trade-wind islands popular tourist resorts.
o The trade winds were named by the crews of sailing ships that depended on the winds during westward ocean crossings.
