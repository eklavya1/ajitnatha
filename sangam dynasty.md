within vijayanagara empire, claimants to power included members of ruling lineage as well as military commanders.
sangama dynasty: it was first dynasty, within vijayanagara empire that exercised control till [[1485]].
dynasty of vijayanagara empire founded in [[14th century]] by 2 brothers: harihara I (also called vira harihara or hakka raya) & bukka raya I.
most striking feature about location of vijayanagara is natural basin formed by river tungabhadra which flows in a north-easterly direction.
one of most prominent waterworks to be seen among ruins is *hiriya canal*.
	• this canal drew water from a dam across tungabhadra & irrigated cultivated valley that separated "sacred centre" from "urban core".
	• this was apparently built by kings of sangama dynasty.
they were supplanted by saluvas, military commanders, who remained in power till 1503. --> [[saluva dynasty]]
