The Prashar Lake lies in the lap of the snow-covered Dhauladhar ranges in the Kullu valley and truly resembles a saucer in shape.
The blue water lake is located at a height of 2730 meters and is fed by rainwater as well as glaciers.
A peculiar phenomenon to see here is a small floating island that keeps moving and changing its position at regular intervals.
