The Indira Gandhi Canal (originally, Rajasthan Canal) is the longest canal of India. It starts from the Harike Barrage at Harike, a few kilometers below the confluence of the Satluj and Beas rivers in the Indian state of Punjab and terminates in irrigation facilities in the Thar Desert in the north west of Rajasthan state. Previously known as the Rajasthan Canal, it was renamed the Indira Gandhi Canal on 2 November 1984 following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

The canal consists of the Rajasthan feeder canal with the first 167 kilometres (104 mi) in Punjab and Haryana state and a further 37 kilometres (23 mi) in Rajasthan followed by the 445 kilometres (277 mi) of the Rajasthan main canal, which is entirely within Rajasthan. The canal enters Haryana from Punjab near Lohgarh village then runs through the western part of the Sirsa district before entering Rajasthan near Kharakhera village in the Tibbi tehsil of the Hanumangarh district. The canal traverses seven districts of Rajasthan: Barmer, Bikaner, Churu, Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, and Sriganganagar. The main canal is 445 km long which is 1458 RD (RD represents reduced distance). From 1458 RD, one branch starts, known as Sagar mal gopa branch or the SMGS. Sagar mal gopa branch is 96 km long. From the end point of SMGS, another subbranch starts, which is the last subbranch of this canal named as Baba Ramdev sub-branch and it is 92 km long. It ends near Gunjangarh village in Jaisalmer district.
