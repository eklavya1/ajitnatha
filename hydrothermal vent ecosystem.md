floor of aquatic biome, k/a benthos, was once thought to be a dead zone because of lack of oxygen & light.
however, sediment in benthos provides nutrients enough to support organisms such as worms, fish, & bacteria.
seafloor contains some unusual ecological niches c/a hydrothermal vents, where energy from interior of earth creates hot springs of water & communities of bacteria that can withstand high temperatures. 
these areas could have been key to emergence of life.
hydrothermal microorganisms are able to thrive just outside hottest waters, in temperature gradients that form b/w hot venting fluid & cold seawater.
these microbes are foundation for life in hydrothermal vent ecosystems.
instead of using light energy to turn carbon dioxide into sugar as plants do, they harvest chemical energy from minerals & chemical compounds that spew from vents—a process k/a chemosynthesis.
these compounds—such as hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen gas, ferrous iron, & ammonia—lack carbon.
microbes release new compounds after chemosynthesis, some of which are toxic, but others can be taken in nutritionally by other organisms.
