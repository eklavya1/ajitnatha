Originally the word Hindu did not have a religious connotation but merely denoted the people in a geographical area- the river Indus.
Later the word assumed a religious connotation, to some extent under the Mughal rule but more firmly under British rule.
Hinduism is the World's third largest religion having approximately 16% of the global population or 1.25 billion people followers.

Main features associated with Hinduism
o Hinduism derives its basic ideas and tradition from the Vedas, considered as Sruti, 'that which is heard or revealed'. Ex: Rigveda consists of a collection of prayers to gods like Agni, Vayu, Varuna, Indra, Mitra, Soma, Ushas etc. Samaveda is a collection of certain verses of the Rigveda for melodic rendering. Yajurveda contains sacrificial formulae to be pronounced by priests. Atharvaveda consists of magical incantations and medicines.
o The rite of homa (havan) was basic to Hinduism in the initial stages. However, the religion assimilated the practices and ways of other cults and earlier inhabitants. Thus the 'puja' form of a workshop to an image or symbol of divinity was incorporated. This power of assimilation is one of the major reasons for the survival of Hinduism.
o The fundamental goal for a Hindu is to achieve Until the attainment of Moksha, human beings are subject to rebirth.
- The Law of Karma is another important aspect associated with religion. Karma is a concept of Hinduism which explains through a system where beneficial effects are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a soul's reincarnated lives forming a cycle of rebirth.

Another aspect associated with Hinduism is- the concept of four stages of life (celibate student, a householder, a hermit and ascetic)
The Hindu view of life does not preclude worldly pleasure and artha (prosperity)
Hinduism believes in leading life in a righteous (Dharma) manner to realize the fundamental goal of Moksha.
Upanishads are the philosophical-religious texts of Hinduism (also known as Sanatan Dharma meaning "Eternal Order" or "Eternal Path") which develop and explain the fundamental tenets of the religion.
