recently, ministry of food processing industries (mofpl) has launched pm formalization of micro food processing enterprises (pm fme) scheme as a part of 'atmanirbhar bharat abhiyan'.
## features:
one district one product (odop) approach:
	• states would identify food products for districts keeping in view existing clusters  & availability of raw material.
	• odop could be perishable produce-based or cereal-based or a food item widely produced in an area. e.g. mango, potato, pickle, millet-based products, fisheries, poultry, etc.
other focus areas:
	• waste to wealth products, minor forest products,  & aspirational districts.
	• capacity building  & research: academic  & research institutions under mofpl along with state level technical institutions would be provided support for training of units, product development, appropriate packaging,  & machinery for micro-units.
financial support:
	• existing individual micro food processing units desirous of upgrading their units can avail credit-linked capital subsidy at 35% of eligible project cost with a maximum ceiling of rs. 10 lakh per unit.
	support would be provided through credit-linked grants at 35% for development of common infrastructure including common processing facility, lab, warehouse, etc. through FPOs/SHGs cooperatives or state-owned agencies or private enterprises.
	a seed capital (initial funding) of rs. 40,000- per self help group (shg) member would be provided for working capital  & purchase of small tools.
Duration:
	• It will be implemented over a period of five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25.
Funding Details:
	• It is a centrally sponsored scheme with an [[outlay]] of Rs. 10,000 crore. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
	• The expenditure under the scheme would be shared in 60:40 ratio between Central and State Govemments, in 90:10 ratio with North Eastern and the Himalayan States, 60:40 ratio with I-JTs with the legislature, and 100% by Centre for other UTs.
