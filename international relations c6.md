international relations class 06

class started with a brief discussion of previous class (1.20 pm)

reasons for a recent thaw in india- pakistan relationship

continuation of india-pakistan relationship (1.22 pm)
continuation of india-pakistan relationship (1.22 pm)

pulwama attacks - india withdrew mfn status
india's retaliatory non-military balakot strike.
relations b/w india & pakistan are caught up in dialogue - disruptions - dialogue cycle.

reasons behind disruptive relationship (1.31 pm)
reasons behind disruptive relationship (1.31 pm)

it's  b/c despite fact that almost every indian pm has paid personal attention to india- pakistan relationship.
1) presence of deep-state in pakistan (rather than state have army, in case of pakistan it seems like army has been given a state to administration.
2)  presence of jihadi elements.
raison d'etre  (reason for existence) of powerful army, as well as jihadi elements, is in dispute with india.
3) failure of govt. of india & its political elites to understand true nature of pakistani status
4) failure of indian govt. to articulate clear policy with respect to pakistan with clearly defined long-term goals.

suggested solution: how to deal with pakistan? (1.48 pm)
suggested solution: how to deal with pakistan? (1.48 pm)

evaluation of option of enmity/animosity with pakistan
it's not advisable option
1) pakistan is a rogue state under influence of radical forces & therefore prone to brinksmanship.
therefore taking such a risk is not advisable.
2) instrument to pursue enmity with pakistan are weak.
india withdrew mfn status from pakistan foll pulwama attack.
it hardly affects pakistan given low volume of formal trade. ( 5 billion $)
weaponising indus water treaty - practically neither feasible nor advisable.
3) internationally isolating pakistan - it's easier said than done.
given strategic location of pakistan, sharing land borders with afghan, central asia, iran, & indian ocean.
it's considered a pivot state in international politics.
such a state can never be successfully isolated in international sphere.
america chooses pakistan as a strategic ally ( non-nato major ally) in its war against terror in afghanistan.
china is all-weather ally of pakistan while russia is warming up to it.
therefore, hostility with pakistan can not be long-term policy of govt. of india.

option of friendship with pakistan (2.15 pm)
option of friendship with pakistan (2.15 pm)

this is only viable choice.
in fact, peace with pakistan is a compulsion.
as rightly commented by former pm atal bihari vajpayee "friends can change but not neighbours who have to live together"
whenever india seeks to pursue peace with pakistan, it becomes vulnerable to terror attacks. 

suggested solutions (2.22 pm)
suggested solutions (2.22 pm)

1) pursue back-channel diplomacy as recent nsa of 2 countries & their appointed interlocutors.
such diplomacy from media has been responsible for recent thawing in india- pakistan bilateral relationship.
2) india should improve relations with countries that have leverage over pakistan like saudi arabia, uae, etc.
3) india should develop international community's stake in indian economy. it will act as biggest hedge against pakistan sponsored terror attacks,
4) india should try to get comprehensive convention against international terrorism, adopted by un
5) india should continue to maintain spirit of india i.e its cosmopolitan pluralistic nature.
it's in this context, politically imaginative solutions for india's kashmir issue are suggested.

bilateral issues in india- pakistan relationship (2.51 pm)
bilateral issues in india- pakistan relationship (2.51 pm)

kashmir issue
why issue of kashmir is difficult to resolve?
it's  b/c issue of kashmir has become identity issue for both india & pakistan.
1) kashmir is a muslim majority state of india.
if it chooses to accede to pakistan, it will strengthen pakistan's claim that religion is basis of nationhood.
if it chooses its association with india, it will bolster india's secular credentials as well as idea of composite nationhood of india.
2) kashmir is a strategic location.
it has close proximity to central asia, afghanistan, & iran.
3) kashmir is rich in water resources.
several indian & pakistan himalayan rivers originate in himalayas of kashmir.
in fact, pakistan identifies kashmir to be core issue b/w 2 countries which until resolved, there can be no normalization in india - pakistan relationship.
suggested solution for kashmir issue (3.07 pm)
1) conduct a plebiscite i.e direct instrument of democracy to elicit opinion of kashmiri people with respect to which country they would like to draw in.
it was earlier suggested by former pm jawahar lal nehru as well as un during fir war b/w india & pakistan.
today pakistan insists on it as a solution to india - pakistan dispute but now india challenges legitimacy of plebiscite given pakistan's occupancy of pok for long & consequent change in its demography.
2) third-party mediation:
pakistan suggests 3rd party mediation to resolve kashmir dispute but acc to india, it's violative of shimla agreement under which 2 countries agreed to resolve any such disputes only bilaterally.
3) present govt has ended sp status given to state of j&k by abrogating article 370 & reorganizing state into 2 uts bringing it under direct control of center.
one of reasons for such a step by indian govt. is withdrawal of us forces from afghanistan & return of taliban.
there was apprehension that once jihadi element in afghanistan are free from fighting nato forces, they may refocus their energy towards india.
lawless afghanistan may be used to launch attacks on kashmir & through kashmir on rest of india.
these steps have been relatively successful in controlling insurgency in kashmir security approach can only provide limited solutions.
for long-term solutions, there is a need to come out with politically, imaginative solutions.
former pm vajpayee had suggested resolving kashmir dispute under paradigm of kashmiriyat, insaniyat, & jhamooriyat.
former pm dr. manmohan singh along with his pakistani counterpart pravesh mushraff had reached understanding to convert loc into a soft border that would be jointly managed by indian & pakistani forces & allow for free movement of people, goods, & services across borders.

gilgit - baltistan issue (3.28 pm)
gilgit - baltistan issue (3.28 pm)

pakistan didn't militarily occupy this region foll india- pakistan war rather it came under control of pakistan foll defection of british military officer who was given responsibility of security of this region.
since then, it has been recognized by pakistan as part of un declared disputed area referred to as northern areas while people living here or living in region have been denied citizenship of pakistan.
however, in november 2020, imran khan govt. announced its decision to accord provincial status to this region making it 5th province of pakistan.
india's stand:
unlike pakistan, india has claimed  gilgit-baltistan to be a constitutional part of india & has declared people of this region as its citizens so much so that j& k assembly had 2 seats reserved to represent population of that region.
reasons for change in approach of pakistan:
1) cpec passes through this region.
china was concerned with respect to disputed nature of region.
therefore to assuage such concern of china, pakistan is giving region provincial status.
india alleges it to be a measure of mass human rights violations.
as a repost to india's strengthening its claim on j & k by abrogating article 370.

1984: operation meghdoot: this glacier is under india's control.

need?

common solution from both countries.

sir creek dispute (4.08 pm)
sir creek dispute (4.08 pm)
