Pashtuns (,  or ; Pashto: پښتانه, Pəx̌tānə́), also called Pakhtuns or Pathans and historically known as Afghans, are an Iranic ethnic group who are native to Central and South Asia. Pashtuns are the 26th-largest ethnic group in the world, and the largest segmentary lineage society. There are an estimated 350–400 Pashtun tribes and clans, with a variety of origin theories.Pashtuns are indigenous to southern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan (a historical region sometimes referred to as Pashtunistan), which is where the majority of the population continues to reside today. Significant and historical communities of the Pashtun diaspora exist in the Pakistani provinces of Sindh and Punjab (particularly in the cities of Karachi and Lahore) and in the Rohilkhand region of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (as well as in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai); a recent diaspora has formed in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf (primarily in the United Arab Emirates) as part of the larger South Asian diaspora in that region.The ethnic group's native language is Pashto, an Iranian language in the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. The Dari dialect of Persian serves as the second language of Pashtuns in Afghanistan, while Pashtuns in South Asia speak Urdu and Hindi (see Hindustani language) as their second language.The total population of the Pashtun people worldwide is estimated to be around 49 million; however, this figure is disputed due to the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979. Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, constituting around 48% of the country's total population. They have been the dominant ethnolinguistic group in Afghanistan since the nation's founding. Additionally, Pashtuns are the second-largest ethnic group in Pakistan, constituting around 15% to 18% of the country's total population, and are considered to be one of the five major ethnolinguistic groups of the Pakistani nation. Prominent Pashtun figures include Aamir Khan, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Abdul Ghani Khan, Ahmad Shah Durrani, Alauddin Khalji, Ayub Khan, Bahlul Lodi, Imran Khan, Irrfan Khan, Khushal Khan, Madhubala, Malala Yousafzai, Malalai of Maiwand, Mirwais Hotak, Mohammed Daoud Khan, Pir Roshan, Rahman Baba, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Shahid Afridi, Sher Shah Suri, and Zakir Hussain, among others.
