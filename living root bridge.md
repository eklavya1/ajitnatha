a living root bridge is a type of simple suspension bridge formed of living plant roots by tree shaping. they are common in the southern part of the northeast indian state of [[meghalaya]]. they are handmade from the aerial roots of rubber fig trees (ficus elastica) by the khasi and jaintia peoples of the mountainous terrain along the southern part of the shillong plateau. most of the bridges grow on steep slopes of subtropical moist broadleaf forest between 50 and 1,150 m (160 and 3,770 ft) above sea level.as long as the tree from which it is formed remains healthy, the roots in the bridge can naturally grow thick and strengthen. new roots can grow throughout the tree's life and must be pruned or manipulated to strengthen the bridge. once mature some bridges can have as many as  50 or more people crossing, and have a lifespan of up to 150 years. without active care, many bridges have decayed or grown wild, becoming unusable. root bridges have also been observed in the indian state of nagaland.living root bridges have also been created in [[indonesia]] at jembatan akar on the island of [[sumatra]], and in the banten province of [[java]], by the [[baduy]] people.
