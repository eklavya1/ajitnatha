blockchain and cryptocurrency are going to be a big part of the comind fourth industrial revolution. It should be duty of the government to ensure that the public is aware about the uses of cryptocurrency.

- Q Can we support Pakistan and burst crackers or chant Pakistan zindabad in an India vs Pakistan Cricket match ? Critically analyse.
	- freedom of speech is a constitutional given to us by the constitution in article 19
	- however, it does not mean that we indulge in activities that are indirectly against nation's interest
	- although, it might not be a very big issue when a man shouts and hails a neighbouring country's victory, it highlights our flaws in the nation building and why some sections of the society feel alienatee from us
	- the current political is antithetical to fostering a spirit of welcoming attitue in us
	- similarly, bursting crackers is something of a private choice, no actor can ask you to stop doing it
	- considering the world that we live in and what is happening to the health of the planet, one needs to be not myopic about one's actions and their long-term consequences
	- if we can allow for behavioural change in our lifestyles then it can improve not only our life but also of the nation and indirectly of the world
	- on the same note, if we make an agenda of including all religious and cultural minorities to feel that they too have a stake in the nation, perhaps it will do far better than threatening or arresting them in the name of national security. such steps will only look aggressive and will paint the state as the gargantuan enemy in their minds
	- disaffected citizens often turn to crime and extortion and in some cases to terrorism

# 20 oct 2021 What are the challenges in conducting Caste census. What are its advantages
caste consensus is going to be a difficult exercise because of the following -
- people arbitrarily use/change their surnames, gotras and first name
- there is no central authority that keeps a check on this
- even for elections, considerable resources are used up, doing a caste consensus will take a lot of time and resources that cannot be justified fully
- people may manipulate the consensus in their favor
- we can better identify the social groups / sub-groups that need the state's help in getting representation and education
# 15 oct 2021
- [ ] what prison reforms are required to imp the condition of prisoners ?
	- highest no. of prisoners from ST, SC and muslim communities
	- lack of cash, political reach and fear of system responsible for their continued misery
	- poor conditions in prison, often justified for this by reinstating their criminal records
	- they are to be treated humanely and this should be completely independent of their criminal past
	- usually criminals with good socio-economic backgrounds have the influence in cells
	- misuse of UAPA & NSA
	- lets not develop an orwellian state that praises conformity at the cost of truth and questioning by the citizens. no matter how efficient such a state can get, it will always loose on the moral ground of effective governance
	- indian prisons have a hight incarceration and occupancy rate. the powerless of them are the first to get hit by unforseen circumstances
	- PROVISIONS
		- to look after the basic needs of prisoners
		- to make sure that they have access to judicial know-how so that those who are falsely accused can ensure speedy justice
		- not to pander after rich/influential criminals
		- sensitivity by prison officials on the plight of inmates
