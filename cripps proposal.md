## main proposals of cripps mission
an indian union with a dominion status would be set up & it would be free to decide its relations with commonwealth & free to participate in united nations & other international bodies.
after end of war, a [[constituent assembly]] wd be convened to frame a new [[constitution]].
members of ds assembly would be partly elected by provincial assemblies through [[proportional representation]] & partly nominated by princes.
## british government would accept new constitution subject to 2 conditions -
any province not willing to join union could have a separate constitution & form a separate union, &
new constitution-making body & brit govt wd negotiate a treaty to effect transfer of power & to safeguard racial &  religious minorities.
in meantime, defence of india would remain in british hands & governor- general's powers would remain intact.
