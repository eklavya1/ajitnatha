the iqama or iqamah (arabic: إِقَامَة, ʾiqāmah) is the second call to islamic prayer, given immediately before prayer begins.  the iqama is given a more rapid and less sonorous rendering than the first call, the adhan, because it is intended merely to draw the attention of those already in the mosque, rather than to remind those outside the mosque to come in. the phrases of the iqama and the adhan are the same, though there are variations among sects in the preferred number of repetitions of the phrases.
