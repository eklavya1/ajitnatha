# plagues of this century
- [[plato]] said
	- our chief business should be to be the chief supervisor of stories
- moral crisis in public sphere
- degraded sense of materialism
- lack of purpose in the life of social sphere
- mere consumption has become the be-all end-all target
	- driving factors behind it
		- poverty
		- parents
		- society
	- it's a self-propagating story
- our greatest minds are busy figuring out how to save face and humiliate the neighbour with a single arrow !
- we have progressed so much thanks to our predecessors, yet we seem to be in a constant state of worry
- even the top earners somehow feel insecure
	- if they have managed to come here, they want to make sure that their kids enjoy the position of priviledge
	- such kind of _dynastic mentality_ needs to go away
	- ambition is good only if it is serving some higher purpose, otherwise we are just a selfish person out of many other selfish "robots"
# the crisis of education
- why is money not taught in school ?
- why is taking care of one's body in our 40s, 50s and later stages of life not a discussion ?
- why arent relationships, empathy and collaboration not topics in our curriculum ?
- why are we always pitting students against each other [[arcade]] [[gladiator]]
	- philosophy of one age is the tragedy of another
- if something as important as money is ignored, then what's the point of it all ?
- [[19th century]] [[industrial revolution]]
- [[21st century]] problem solvers
- ideals - [[elon musk]] [[tony stark]]
- [[mathematics]] teaching should be started from scratch
- why are we always running from one class to another ? if we don't learn from it then there is no use in mindless running
- it is pointless
- also the grading system ensured that students privilege grades over understanding
- online systems can be employed very effectively for dealing with this
- the impossible and quite frankly stupid dreams stashed into the minds of students by the teachers - IIT, MIT, PMT, CA
	- though not bad in themselves, we need to understand that there is life beyond them !
- the real problem is economic in nature and inequality of wealth distribution, more work to be done on it so that these meta-problems can be soothed if not done away completely (human nature doesn't permit that)

# the short term bandage
- increase computer usage in society
	- at least some [[scarcity]] can be done away. you don't fight for a copy of a computer file since it can be reproduced [[ad infinitum]]
	- massive shift from the physical to the digital / virtual
	- _virtual-first_ approach as opposed to it being a mere dumbed-down copy of the atomic world
- NGOs and self-help groups to understand each other
- changing public mindset by altering how media is shown
- deaddiction centres for drugs and digital devices
- legislation on companies to stop being predatory and change the way software is designed
- helping people and kids with divorce issues
- some provisions for alternative family not necessarily based on blood relations
- devising methods to cope up with mental diseases
- shifting the story away from money and career to meaning and satisfaction
- advising rich folks to refrain from naked display of wealth and encouraging them to be model citizens by putting that wealth to good use
	- best would be R&D funding (in my opinion)
	- [[medici]]
- a family membe exchange programmer where each week or when desired by people they can spend an agreed amount of time with some other family that is not in their immediate social and economic vicinity
	- idea is -  my growth doesn't necessarily mean destruction of yours and vice versa
- shifting the public habit of spending into that of saving (going to be very tough)
- acceptance of people for who they are, not for the titles that they hold
# what should be an ideal life for 21st century ?
- attention, money and other resources devoted to life-extension and anti-ageing research
- science and research to be a fixed and unalterable part of a nation's budget
- worth of a nation to be judged by the useful knowledge produced per year and how it changed lives
- how to lift billions out of drudgery and then how to give them a template for life so that they don't waste themselves away
- how to make use of the free time in solving problems instead of creating artificial ones
- how to stop worrying about others getting ahead of you
- how can I generate lasting happiness and stability that gives me a better sense of who I am ?
- how to stop the urge to dominate others and start being more humble in life
- [[scarcity mindset]] v/s [[abundance mindset]]
# totally crazy items here
- limit human population to such a level that we can ensure high living standards for all those who take birth, that way the ugly face of poverty and mindless working for money can be reduced
	- this will need advances in robotics to fuel an ageing society of alte 21st century
	- anti-ageing tech and medical science stuff comes into play
	- changing role of age related roles
- make a database of mental activities and run an algorithmic search with the kind of tasks out there
	- like matching of buy & sell order in [[stock moc]] market

		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUu-6UxuGr8
		- software - the dot collector
- universal basic income + gradual shifting of jobs from totally useless / exploitatory to meaningful ones, value creating ones
