A Mediterranean climate , also called dry summer climate is characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. The climate receives its name from the Mediterranean Basin, where this climate type is most common. Mediterranean climate zones are typically located along the western coasts of continents, between roughly 30 and 45 degrees north and south of the equator. The main cause of Mediterranean, or dry summer climate, is the subtropical ridge which extends toward that hemisphere's pole during the summer and migrates toward the equator during the winter due to the seasonal poleward-equatorward variations of temperatures.The resulting vegetation of Mediterranean climates are the garrigue or maquis in the Mediterranean Basin, the chaparral in California, the fynbos in South Africa, the mallee in Australia, and the matorral in Chile. Areas with this climate are also where the so-called "Mediterranean trinity" of major agricultural products have traditionally developed: wheat, grapes and olives.Most historic cities of the Mediterranean Basin lie within Mediterranean climatic zones, including Algiers, Athens, Barcelona, Beirut, İzmir, Jerusalem, Marseille, Monaco, Naples, Rome, Tunis, Valencia, and Valletta. Current major cities with Mediterranean climates outside of the Mediterranean Basin include Adelaide, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dushanbe, Lisbon, Los Angeles, Perth, Porto, San Diego, San Francisco, Santiago, Tashkent and Victoria.

- Mediterranean Climate: The Mediterranean climate is characterized by very distinctive climatic features with dry, warm summers and wet, cold winters and local [[geo 22|winds]]. The seasonal characteristics are as follows:
- Dry, warm summers with off-shore Tradewinds:
- During the summer months, the sun is overhead the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.
- The belt of the influence of the Westerlies is shifted polewards, and the rain-bearing tradewinds are likely to be off-shore.
- Hence the regions are practically rainless in summers and hence remain dry.
- Wet, cold winters with on-shore Westerlies:
- In the winter months, the Westerlies belt shifts equatorward and the Mediterranean regions are under the influence of on-shore Westerlies.
- Hence, these lands receive almost all of their precipitation during the winter months.
- The rain comes in heavy downpours and causes floods in the months of September and October in Mediterranean [[Europe]].
- Southern [[Europe]] comes under the influence of offshore winds during summer. Hence, rainfall is confined to winter alone.
- Citrus fruits such as oranges, figs, olives, and grapes are commonly cultivated in Mediterranean Region
