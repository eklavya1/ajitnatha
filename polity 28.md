# article 356 (continued)
(1:23- 02:08 pm)
- _[[a357]]_

- article 357. exercise of legislative powers under proclamation issued under article 356 _[[a356 Provisions in case of failure of constitutional machinery in State]]_

- whereby a proclamation issued under clause (1) of article 356, it has been declared that powers of legislature of state shall be exercisable by or under authority of parliament.

- article 357 (2): any law made in exercise of power of legislature of state by parliament or president or other authority referred to in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) which parliament or president or such other authority would not, but for issue of a proclamation under article 356, have been competent to make shall, after proclamation has ceased to operate, continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by a competent legislature or other authority.

- q. upon proclamation of article 356 in a state, state legislative assembly: a) gets automatically dissolved b) can be dissolved after 6 months c) can be dissolved after approval of parliament. (ans: c)

- explanation: as per supreme court judgments. (sr bommai case)
# issues associated with article 356
- [[hung assembly]]
- [[a356 Provisions in case of failure of constitutional machinery in State]] - fav of corrupt politicians in country
- expression “breakdown of constitutional machinery” is vague/subjective-> open to misuse.
- often been misused to remove/dismiss opposition parties from power at state level.
- governor’s report has been manipulated to advantage of party in power at center.
- in case of a [[hung assembly]], provisions under a356 have been misused to dissolve legislature to deny a chance to opposition parties to explore possibility of formation of a govt.
# sarkaria commission on article 356
- any abuse or misuse of this drastic power would damage democratic fabric of [[constitution]].
- article 356 should be used sparingly, as a last measure, when all available alternatives had failed to prevent or rectify a breakdown of constitutional machinery in a state.
- it further recommended that a warning be issued to errant state, in specific terms that it's not carrying on govt of state in accordance with constitution. before taking action under article 356, any explanation received from state should be taken into account.
- in a situation of political breakdown, governor should explore all possibilities of having a govt enjoying majority support in assembly.
# s.r. bommai vs. union of india case judgement
- power conferred by article 356 upon president is a conditioned power. it's not absolute power. existence of material - which may comprise of or include report(s) of governor - is a pre-condition. satisfaction must be formed on relevant material.
- president shall exercise power of dissolving legislative assembly only after proclamation is approved by both houses of parliament & not before.
- until such approval, president can only suspend legislative assembly.
- it should be resorted to only where it's found necessary for achieving purposes of proclamation.
- in case both houses of parliament disapprove or do not approve proclamation, proclamation lapses at end of two-month period.
- in such a case, govt which was dismissed revives.
- legislative assembly, which may have been kept in suspended animation gets reactivated.
- since proclamation lapses - & is not retrospectively invalidated - acts done, orders made & laws passed during period of 2 months do not become illegal or void.
- they are, however, subject to review, repeal or modification by govt/legislative assembly or other competent authority.
- election of a new party at center can’t be a ground for imposition of article 356
- article 74(2) merely bars inquiry into question of whether any & if so, what advice was tendered by ministers to president. it does not bar court from calling upon union council of ministers (union of india) to disclose to court material upon which president had formed requisite satisfaction.
- proclamation under article 356(1) is not immune from judicial review.
- supreme court or high court can strike down proclamation if it's found to be [[mala fide]] or based on wholly irrelevant or extraneous grounds.
- when c/a upon, union of india has to produce material on basis of which action was taken.
- it cannot refuse to do so if it seeks to defend action.
- court will not go into correctness of material or its adequacy. its inquiry is limited to see whether material was relevant to action.
- if court strikes down proclamation, it has power to restore dismissed govt to office & revive & reactivate legislative assembly wherever it may have been dissolved or kept under suspension.
- guidelines provided by court in a nutshell 
- court will not ask what advice ministry has given to president but court can ask for material evidence to be produced.
- material should be a speaking document that can allow any rational person to take a decision
- no immediate dissolution of assembly till resolution has been approved by parliament.
- only test of majority is floor test #doubt 
- decision can be reversed & subject to judicial review if malafide intention is present.
- why has use of article 356 declined since 1990s?
- sr bommai case
- era of coalition govt.
- presidential activism
