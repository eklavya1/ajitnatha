## Measurement of Poverty in India
1:02 PM

## Different Poverty Line Baskets
- [[Poverty Line Basket]]
- Prices change, but [[Poverty]] line basket (standard) will remain same.
- E.g. In [[2011]] cost of basket was, say Rs. 100, in [[2015]] (for same basket) cost may be Rs. 150.
## Suresh Tendulkar Committee
(1:10 PM)
- #committee 
- Tendulkar Committee was set up in [[2005]], gave recommendations in [[2008]]-[[2009]]
- poverty line based on consumption expenditure was about Rs. 4800/household/month (Urban).
- 4800 expenditure will reflect about 10000/month income.
- For a household of five Rs. 4800 will translate into Rs. 32/day/person (this was politicized by media, opposition, etc.)
## C Rangarajan Committee
(1:22 PM)
- #committee 
- [[c rangarajan committee]] related name [[rangarajan committee]]
- same task of determining poverty line was given to C Rangarajan.
- In [[2012]], he came up with almost same recommendations like Tendulkar Committee.
- It had more scientific explanations, & a few more explanations were given.
- Both committees recognized that ‘behavioral’ expenses were done by households. _related_ [[daniel kahneman author]]
- Tendulkar Committee’s major recommendation was with respect to behaviourally determining expenses.
- Rangarajan gave a more scientific basis & presented poverty line in a more organized manner. 
- Essentially both Tendulkar’s & Rangarajan’s Poverty Line are structurally same. Rangarajan recommended following: 
### Normatively determined component
(1:45 PM)
- This has food & non-food component. 
- normative expense on food was based on ICMR guidelines, using which food requirements of a general household of five were estimated. 
- Similarly in non-food expenses ‘scientific basis was used to determine minimum expenses on various components. 
### Behaviourally Determined component
- Rangarajan looked at expenses done by middle 10% of [[population]], by referring to NCES data. 
- poverty line was thus a combination of both normative & behavioral components.
- Tendulkar introduced idea of a **Mixed-recall period**, which was a change from existing method of a Uniform recall period (URP). 
- Rangarajan further modified MRP to MMRP (**Modified Mixed Recall Period**).
- Recall-Period is time for which respondent to survey is asked to recall data for.
- Earliermei  during URP, respondents recalled their expenses on all items for a uniform period of 1 year.
- On recom 
- mendation of professor Angus Deaton, Tendulkar introduced MRP (Mixed Recall Period), under this, items that were consumed with high frequency such as food had a shorter recall period, whereas items that were consumed in less frequency, had a longer recall period.
- This minor change was able to drastically improve accuracy of expenses as reported by respondents.
- Rangarajan further modified it.
- Poverty can also be estimated from National Account Statistics (NAS). NAS has income data. 
- Poverty estimates from NAS, usually vary from poverty estimates from NCES. This is so because income information is volatile, less accurate, & maybe not revealed truthfully. 
- Rangarajan recommended that it  sd be NCES which  sd be used to estimate poverty.
- Rangarajan was also asked to recommend an alternate method to estimate poverty. 
- He suggested that as a post-do expenditure, _a household’s ability to save can also be used to assess poverty._ 
- In [[2015]], NITI Aayoga was tasked to recommend poverty line. They suggested that existing official poverty line of Tendulkar was comprehensive, & it need not be changed. 
- At same time, they said, that poverty line  sd not be basis beneficiaries, which  sd be done using SECC data.
## Estimation of Poverty (internationally)
3:44 PM
- [[world bank]]’s Estimate of Poverty:
	- World Bank classifies countries on an income basis into three groups. 
	- High-Income Countries (Per capita income: greater than 12,000 dollars).
	- middle -Income Countries: (High Middle Income: 6,000 to 12,000 dollars, Low Middle Income countries: 1,200 to 6,000 dollars)
	- Low-Income Countries: Pci less than 1,200 dollars
- Each group of countries has its own group-specific poverty line.
- poverty line of low-income countries is also called Extreme Poverty Line. 
- A person who is poor in a low-income country is poorest among poor, i.e. ‘extremely poor’. 
- A poor in any country be it high or middle income, if is poor even according to standard of poverty in a low-income country would be extremely poor.
- Under Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) target was to half incidence of extreme poverty in world by [[2015]].
- Extreme Poverty was then defined at ‘1.1 Dollars’ per person per day.
- Under Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG-1 targets to eliminate incidence of extreme poverty by [[2030]].
- To covert extreme poverty line, which is denominated in dollars, to a local currency, PPP exchange rates are used.
## Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
(3:54 PM)
- [[PPP#economics 04]]
## General PPP Exchange Rate
- (4:05 PM)
- In general, a basket of goods & services can be constructed on which an average household spends money on.
- price of this basket is found in different countries & for purpose of calculating PPP exchange rates, is equated.
- For example: If this basket costs $1000 in US, & Rs. 20,000 in India, then it can be said that Purchasing Power of $1000 is equivalent to purchasing power of Rs.20,000. Thereby $1 is equal to Rs. 20 on a PPP basis.
