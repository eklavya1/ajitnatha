## human evolution and emergence of man
### biological and cultural factors in human evolution
hominization process
by the time of [[Homo erectus]], all the human traits were there
human gave up the usage of tooth as *fifth hand*
the importance of tools as molders of human evolution
try carrying a brick around with you for a day (to realize the commitment hominids have to use their tools regularly)
**major themes of human evolution**
erect [[bipedalism]]
reduction of face
expansion and development of [[brain]]
[[400 Language]]
### theories of organic evolution
[[herbert spencer]]
[[charles darwin]]
descent with modification
the concep of change is inherent in [[evolution]]
#wo_de evolution does not explain how the change arises ?
#### pre- darwinian phase
[[theophrastus]]
[[mendel]]
[[lamarckism]]
#### the darwinian phase
theory of natural selection
[[alfred russell wallace]]
[[1858]]
[[=origin of species book]] [[charles darwin]] [[1859]]
**darwin’s propositions -** 
continuous trial and error on a gigantic scale
universal occurrent of variations
excessive natural rate of multiplication
struggle for existence
survival of the fittest
inheritance of variation
#### theory of natural selection (darwinism)
#### post-darwinian phase
[[hardy weinberg principle]]
extinction is the rule not the norm in evolution
### synthetic theory of evolution
#### basic concepts and terms in evolutionary biology
#### convergence
#### parallelism
#### homology and analogy
#### adaptive radiation
[[dollo’s law]]
#### mosaic evolution - the evolution of plants and wholes
[[bipedalism]] preceded [[encephalization]]
#### cope’s rule
[[cope’s rule]]
#### principle of competitive exclusion or gause’s rule
[[gause's rule]]
## characteristics of primates
#### primates evolutionary trends
many of human’s characteristics are simply a refinement of a basic primate pattern that evolved million of years ago in response to the necessities of arboreal living
behavioral flexibility has taken place of bodily specializations in primates _related_ [[nanotechnology]] | [[technology|ironman]] | [[tony stark]]
increased intelligence, advanced brains, better maternal care go together in the mammals and especially in the primates

#### primate taxonomy and behavior
[[mammals]] invest a great deal of time and energy in their [[offspring]]
[[platypus]] is the only mammal that is poisnous

#### tertiary and quaternary fossil primates
#### a comparative anatomy of man and apes
relative lightness is one of the unique features of humans
[[bipedalism]]
**geological timescale during cenozoic** [[cenozoic era]]
	[[pleistocene]]
	[[pliocene]]
	[[miocene]]
	[[oligocene]]
	[[eocene]]
	[[palaeocene]]
[[prognathism]] of the lower jaw is sometimes observed in human
#### primate adaptations - arboreal and late terrestrial
#### skeletal changes dueo to bipedalism and their implications
[[arthritis]] [[bipedalism#^0dc0bf]]
