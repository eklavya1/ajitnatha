acc to new report, global agricultural productivity is not growing as fast as demand for [[food]], amid the impact of climate change.
the report was *released* in conjunction with the *world food prize foundation's annual conference*.
## Findings of the Report
[[total factor productivity]] (tfp) is growing at an annual rate of 1.36% (2020-2019).
this is below global agricultural productivity index that has set annual target of 1 .73% growth to sustainably meet needs of consumers for food & bioenergy in 2050.
## factors responsible for low tfp growth
tfp growth is influenced by climate change, weather events, changes in fiscal policy, market conditions, investments in infrastructure and agricultural research and development.
## significance of productivity growth:
destruction of forest areas: 36% of the world's land is used for agriculture. forests and biodiverse areas will be destroyed for planting or pasture.
diet-related diseases: usd 2T in economic losses & 4 million deaths are attributed to diet-related diseases each year.
[[soil]] degradation: 90% of the earth's soils could be degraded by erosion by [[2050]].
[[methane]] emissions: 37% of methane emissions from humans influenced activity come from cattle & other ruminants.
*loss of irrigation water: 40% of irrigation water is lost due to inefficient irrigation.*
water sources will be depleted, making prime agricultural [[land]] unusable.
