## Measures can be taken to avoid over-exploitation of resources
Sustainable use of resources means that we use the resources in such a way that meets the demands of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to achieve their own requirements.
The following measures need to be taken to avoid over-exploitation of resources -
	Cultivation of land taking adequate care of soil fertility.
	Development of irrigation facilities with proper water management. Use water-saving devices such as traditional conservation methods and roof-top water harvesting should be used.
	Use of bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides in order to have a biological balance.
	Judicious use of underground water to avoid steep fall in underground water level.
	Use of traditional seeds instead of the high yielding hybrid varieties to avoid the spread of diseases capable of wiping out the entire crops happened with the Irish [[potato]] crop in 1985 and Bengal rice famines in [[1942]].
	Avoid the use of non-degradable material like plastic to prevent problems of waste management.
