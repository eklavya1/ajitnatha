- **synecdoche** ( sin-NEK-də-kee) is a type of metonymy: it is a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something is used to refer to the whole ([[pars pro toto]]), or vice versa ([[totum pro parte]]). The term comes from ancient Greek συνεκδοχή.Examples in common English use are suits for businessmen, wheels for car, and boots for soldiers.

The use of government buildings to refer to their occupants is metonymy and sometimes also synecdoche. "The Pentagon" for the United States Department of Defense can be considered synecdoche, because the building can be considered part of the bureaucracy. Similarly, "The White House" is also an instance of synecdoche since it is widely used to signify the office of the U.S. president. In the same way, using "Number 10" to mean "the Office of the Prime Minister" (of the United Kingdom) is a synecdoche. Similarly, the names of capital cities referring to the sovereign states they govern follows this pattern.
