## Mission statement
- The signatories of the Declaration are to support the establishment of green shipping corridors â€“ zero-emission maritime routes between 2 (or more) ports.
- It is our collective aim to support the **establishment of at least 6 green corridors by the middle of this decade**, while aiming to scale activity up in the following years, by inter alia supporting the establishment of more routes, longer routes and/or having more ships on the same routes. It is our aspiration to see many more corridors in operation by [[2030]]. We will assess these goals by the middle of this decade, with a view to increasing the number of green corridors.
