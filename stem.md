The region of the stem where leaves are born is called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes.
Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection and vegetative propagation.
Underground stems of potato, ginger, turmeric, zaminkand, colocasia are modified to store food in them.
Stem tendrils which develop from axillary buds, are slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb such as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and grapevines.
