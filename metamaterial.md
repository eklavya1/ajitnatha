metamaterials are smart materials that have a wide range of properties can be so diff from each other that there isn't a definition for them, although what they all have in common is that they are from artificial origin.
this means that they aren't found in nature have been created by people.
apart from their artificial origin, metamaterials are characterized because they have unusual electromagnetic properties, coming from their structure arrangement not from their composition.
one of properties that can vary metamaterials can be, for ex, that material has a negative refractive index.
potential applications of metamaterials:
metamaterials are used in potentially novel applications in antenna radar design, subwavelength imaging, invisibility cloak design.
potential applications of metamaterials include optical filtering, medical devices, remote aerospace operations, sensor detectors, solar power management, crowd control, radomes, antenna lenses, even earthquake protection.
lenses made of metamaterials may even enable imaging below diffraction limit that prevents conventional optical lenses from magnifying any further.
