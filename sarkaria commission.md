created to facilitate the central-state relationship

constitution envisages that governor acts on aid & advice of council of ministers, except in those situations in which he is, by or under constitution, required to act in his discretion (article 163).
it's clear that in identifying a candidate who, in his opinion, is in a position to command a majority, governor has to make his own decision, subject, of course, to democratic norms.
usually, governor invites leader of largest single party 1st to form govt.
sarkaria commission on inter-state relations has dealt with question of a hung assembly.
commission's report suggests foll orders for precedence for governors to follow for calling out parties to form a govt:
o alliance formed prior to election.
largest single party staking claim with support of others, including independents.
o a post-electoral coalition, with all partners joining govt.
o a post-poll coalition, with some joining govemment, & others extending support from outside.
as general principles, sarkaria commission says governor should look for a party or combination that commands widest support in assembly, & that "his task is to see that a govemment is formed, & not to try to form a govt which will pursue policies which he approves".

sarkaria commission also gave its recommendations for selection of govemors.
in june 1983, union govt appointed a commission under chairmanship of justice r.s.
sarkaria to review question of centre-state relations.
commission submitted its report to then prime minister rajiv gandhi on 27 october 1987.

sarkaria commission ([[1988]]) recommended that [[a356 Provisions in case of failure of constitutional machinery in State]] should be used in very rare cases when it becomes unavoidable to restore breakdown of constitutional machinery in state.
commission recommended that before taking action under article 356, a warning should be issued to [[state]] [[govt]] that it's not functioningcc to [[constitution]].
