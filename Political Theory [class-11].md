Since the actions of the government affect us deeply, we take a lively interest in what governments do. — location: [55]()

To sum up, politics arises from the fact that we have different visions of what is just and desirable for us and our society. It involves the multiple negotiations that go on in society through which collective decisions are made. At one level, it involves what governments do and how they relate to the aspirations of the people; at another level, it involves how people struggle and influence decision making. — location: [61]()

Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust? I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates. And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one? True. And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march upon the enemy? Certainly. Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief? That, I suppose, is to be inferred. Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing it. That is implied in the argument. — location: [187]()

As citizens, we are a bit like the audience in a music concert; we are not the main performers interpreting the song and melody. But we set the agenda and appreciate the output and put in new requests. Have you noticed that musicians perform better when they know the audience is knowledgeable and appreciative? So also an educated and vigilant citizenry makes those who play politics more public-spirited. — location: [233]()

Some years ago Deepa Mehta, film maker, wanted to make a film about widows in Varanasi. It sought to explore the plight of widows but there was a strong protest from a section of the polity who felt that it would show India in a very bad light, who felt it was being made to cater to foreign audiences, who felt it would bring a bad name to the ancient town. They refused to allow it to be made and as a result it could not be made in Varanasi. It was subsequently made elsewhere. Similarly the book Ramayana Retold by Aubrey Menon and The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie were banned after protest from some sections of society. The film The Last Temptation of Christ and the play Me Nathuram Boltey were also banned after protests. — location: [486]()

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION John Stuart Mill, a political thinker and an activist in the nineteenth century Britain, offered a passionate defence of freedom of expression, including freedom of thought and discussion. In his book On Liberty he offered four reasons why there should be freedom of expression even for those who espouse ideas that appear ‘false’ or misleading today. First, no idea is completely false. What appears to us as false has an element of truth. If we ban ‘false’ ideas, we would lose that element of truth that they contain. This is related to the second point. Truth does not emerge by itself. It is only through a conflict of opposing views that truth emerges. Ideas that seem wrong today may have been very valuable in the emergence of what we consider right kind of ideas. Thirdly, this [[conflict]] of ideas is valuable not just in the past but is of continuing [[value]] for all times. Truth always runs the risk of being reduced to an unthinking cliché. It is only when we expose it to opposing views that we can be sure that this idea is trustworthy. Finally, we cannot be sure that what we consider true is actually true. Very often ideas that were considered false at one point by the entire society and, therefore, suppressed turned out to be true later on. A society that completely suppresses all ideas that are not acceptable today, runs the danger of losing the benefits of what might turn out to be very valuable knowledge. — location: [507]()

Today, equality is a widely accepted ideal which is embodied in the constitutions and laws of many countries. — location: [555]()

The first world of the advanced industrial countries, mainly North America and Western Europe, with 25 per cent of the world’s [[population]], owns 86 per cent of the world’s industry, and consumes 80 per cent of the world’s energy. — location: [569]()

---
Thus we face a paradox : almost everyone accepts the ideal of equality, yet almost everywhere we encounter inequality. — location: [593]()

---
However, treating people with equal respect need not mean always treating them in an identical way. No society treats all its members in exactly the same way under all conditions. The smooth functioning of society requires division of work and functions and people often enjoy different status and rewards on account of it. — location: [615]()

Socrates reminds these young people that if everyone were to be unjust, if everyone manipulated rules to suit their own interests, no one could be sure of benefiting from injustice. Nobody would be secure and this was likely to harm all of them. Hence, it is in our own long-term interest to obey the laws and be just. Socrates clarified that we need to understand clearly what justice means in order to figure out why it is important to be just. He explained that justice does not only mean doing good to our friends and harm to our enemies, or pursuing our own interests. Justice involves the well-being of all people. Just as a doctor is concerned with the well-being of his/her patients, similarly the just ruler or the just government must be concerned with the well-being of the people. Ensuring the well-being of the people includes giving each person his due. — location: [923]()

Private business tends to go where business would be most profitable and hence free markets eventually tend to work in the interest of the strong, the wealthy and the powerful. The result may be to deny, rather than extend, opportunities for those who are relatively weak and disadvantaged. — location: [1094]()

Arguments can be put forward on both sides of the debate but free markets often exhibit a tendency to work in favour of the already privileged. — location: [1096]()

What then constitutes a nation? A nation is to a great extent an ‘imagined’ community, held together by the collective beliefs, aspirations and imaginations of its members. It is based on certain assumptions which people make about the collective whole with which they identify. — location: [1655]()

---
First, a nation is constituted by belief. Nations are not like mountains, rivers or buildings which we can see and feel. They are not things which exist independent of the beliefs that people have about them. To speak of a people as a nation is not to make a comment about their physical characteristics or behaviour. Rather, it is to refer to the collective identity and vision for the [[future]] of a group which aspires to have an independent political existence. To this extent, nations can be compared with a team. — location: [1662]()

---
A nation exists when its members believe that they belong together. — location: [1667]()

---
However, since more than one set of people may lay claim to the same territory, the aspiration for a homeland has been a major cause of conflict in the world. — location: [1684]()

---
Fourth, while territory and shared historical identity play an important role in creating a sense of oneness, it is a shared vision of the [[future]] and the collective aspiration to have an independent political existence that distinguishes groups from nations. — location: [1687]()

Secularism is first and foremost a doctrine that opposes all such forms of inter-religious domination. This is however only one crucial aspect of the concept of secularism. An equally important dimension of secularism is its opposition to intra-religious domination. — location: [1853]()

---
While a large part of our suffering is man-made and hence eliminable, at least some of our suffering is not made by man. Religion, art and philosophy are responses to such sufferings. Secularism too accepts this and therefore it is not anti-religious. — location: [1861]()

---
When religion is organised, it is frequently taken over by its most conservative faction, which does not tolerate any dissent. — location: [1865]()

---
Perhaps one way of preventing religious discrimination is to work together for mutual enlightenment. Education is one way of helping to change the mindset of people. — location: [1877]()

Kemal Ataturk’s Secularism Let us look at a very different kind of secularism practised in Turkey in the first half of the twentieth century.

Oil had been found in the region of Ogoni in Nigeria in the 1950s which resulted in crude oil exploration. Soon economic growth and big business created around it an entangled web of political intrigues, environmental problems and corruption. This prevented development of the very region where oil had been found. — location: [2474]()
