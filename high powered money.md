Determination of the [[money supply]] is currently expressed in terms of the monetary base or high-powered [[money]].
High-powered money is the sum of [[commercial bank]] reserves and currency (notes and coins) held by the Public.
High-powered money is the base for the expansion of bank deposits and the creation of a money supply.
The supply of money varies directly with changes in the monetary base and inversely with the [[currency]] and reserve ratios.
The use of high-powered money consists of the demand of commercial banks for the legal limit or required reserves with the central bank and excess reserves, and the [[demand]] of the public for currency. High power money is the base of money supply [[expansion]] in the [[economy]].

High Power Money = C + OD + CR.
	C = Currency with the public
	OD = Other Deposits of the general public with the RBI (insignificant)
	CR = Cash Reserves of banks which consist of (i.) Cash with banks themselves and (ii) Bankers deposits with RBI.
