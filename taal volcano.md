Taal Volcano (IPA: [ta îal]; Tagalog: Bulkang Taal) is a large caldera filled by Taal Lake in the [[Philippines]]. Located in the province of Batangas, the volcano is second of the most active volcanoes in the country, with 38 recorded historical eruptions, all of which were concentrated on Volcano Island, near the middle of Taal Lake. The caldera was formed by prehistoric eruptions between 140,000 and 5,380 BP.The volcano is located about 50 kilometers (31 mi) south of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.

Taal Volcano has had several violent eruptions in the past, causing deaths on the island and the populated areas surrounding the lake, with an overall death toll of about 6,000. Because of its proximity to populated areas and its eruptive history, the [[volcano]] was designated a Decade Volcano, worthy of close study to prevent future natural disasters. All volcanoes in the Philippines are part of the [[pacific Ring of Fire]].
