prefect (from the latin praefectus, substantive adjectival form of praeficere:  "put in front", meaning in charge) is a magisterial title of varying definition, but essentially refers to the leader of an administrative area.

a prefect's office, department, or area of control is called a prefecture, but in various post-roman empire cases there is a prefect without a prefecture or vice versa. the words "prefect" and "prefecture" are also used, more or less conventionally, to render analogous words in other languages, especially romance languages.
