- [[chhatrapati]] [[shivaji]] terminus (officially chhatrapati shivaji maharaj terminus, formerly victoria terminus, bombay station code: cstm (mainline)[4]/st (suburban)), is a historic terminal train station and unesco world heritage site in mumbai, [[maharashtra]], india.
- the terminus was designed by a british born architectural engineer frederick william stevens from an initial design by axel haig, in an exuberant italian gothic style. its construction began in [[1878]], in a location south of the old bori bunder railway station,[5] and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of queen victoria's rule.
- in march [[1996]] the station name was changed from victoria terminus to "chhatrapati shivaji terminus" (with station code cst) after shivaji, the 17th-century warrior king who employed guerrilla tactics to contest the mughal empire and found a new state in the western marathi-speaking regions of the deccan plateau.[6][7][8]
- shivaji's name is often preceded by "chhatrapati", a title with literal meaning, "a king dignified by the emblem of a parasol; a great king."[9] in 2017, the station was again renamed "chhatrapati shivaji maharaj terminus" (with code csmt), where the title maharaj has literal meaning, "great king; emperor."[10] both former initials "vt" and the current, "cst", are also commonly used.[11]
- the terminus is the headquarters of india's central railway. it is one of the busiest railway stations in india,[12] serving as a terminal for both long-distance and suburban trains
