The total stock of money in circulation among the public at a particular point in time is called money supply.
It needs to be noted that the total stock of money is different from the total supply of money.
Supply of money is only that part of the total stock of money that is held by the public at a particular point in time.
The circulating money involves the currency, printed notes, money in the deposit accounts and the form of other liquid assets.
[[RBI]] publishes figures for 4 altenative measures of money supply, viz MI, M2, M3 and M4.
*CU* is currency (notes plus coins) held by the public and
*DD* is net demand deposits held by commercial banks.

MI = CU + DD
M2 = MI + Savings deposits with Post Office savings banks
M3 = MI + Net time deposits of commercial banks
M4 = M3 + Total deposits with Post Office savings organisations (excluding National Savings Certificates)

The word 'net' implies that only deposits of the public held by the banks are to be included in the money supply.
The interbank deposits, which a commercial bank holds in other commercial banks, are not to be regarded as part of the money supply.
MI and M2 are known as narrow money. M3 and M4 are known as broad money.
Broad Money (M3)
M3 MI + Time deposits with the banking system (MI Currency with public + Demand deposits with the Banking system (current account, saving account) + Other deposits with RBI)
M4 M3 + All deposits with post office savings banks
These gradations are in decreasing order of liquidity.
MI is the most liquid and easiest for transactions whereas M4 is the least liquid of all.
M3 is the most commonly used measure of the money supply. It is also known as aggregate monetary resources.
