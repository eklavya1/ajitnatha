seat of gram nyayalaya is located at headquarters of intermediate panchayat, but they go to villages, work there & dispose of cases.
procedure followed by gram nyayalayas
gram nyayalayas can follow sp. procedures in civil matters, in a manner it deems just & reasonable in interest of justice.

at present, only 208 ‚Äògram nyayalayas‚Äô are functioning in country as against 2,500 estimated to be required by 12th five year plan.

alternative dispute resolution (adr) (2.05 pm)

adr is a mechanism of dispute resolution that is nonadversarial, i.e. working together co-operatively to reach best resolution for everyone.
tools of alternative dispute redressal
1) arbitration is a process in which a neutral 3rd party or parties render a decision based on merits of case.
2) mediation is a process in which a non-partisan 3rd party ‚Äúmediator‚Äù facilitates development of a consensual solution by disputing parties. 
3) conciliation is a process by which resolution of disputes is achieved by compromise or voluntary agreement.
it's a less formal form of arbitration. 
in contrast to arbitration, conciliator does not render a binding award. parties 
are free to accept or reject recommendations of conciliator.
section 89 of civil procedure code provides for settlement of disputes outside court.
rationale for alternative dispute resolution
1) speedy & expeditious resolution of disputes: 
2) cost-effective
3) reduces burden on public finances in a country where resources are already strained
4) amiable settlement for people involved
5) confidentiality:
6) harmonious resolution of disputes & interest to society at large
shortcomings of adr mechanisms
1)  wastage of time/ money if case is not resolved
2) possibility of bias
3) compromising confidentiality
4) limited judicial review
5) informal, more opportunities of abuse of power
6) lack of power to establish legal precedents
7) unfamiliarity with procedure & lack of awareness

family courts (2.28 pm)

family courts act, 1984 provides for establishment of family courts by state govts in consultation with high courts with a view to promote conciliation & secure speedy settlement of disputes relating to marriage & family affairs & for matters connected therewith. 
main objectives & reasons for setting up family courts are:
to create a specialized court which will exclusively deal with family matters so that such a court may have necessary expertise to deal with these cases expeditiously. thus expertise & expedition are 2 main factors for establishing such a court
to institute a mechanism for conciliation of disputes relating to family
to provide inexpensive remedy
to have flexibility & informal atmosphere in conduct of proceedings
issues with family courts functioning
family courts‚Äô main purpose is to assist smooth & effective disposal of cases relating to family matters.
however, like any other system, there are certain issues that become a matter of concern when it comes to working of these courts.
one such issue is that of lack of continuity. for ex, in family courts in tamil nadu, counselors are changed every 3 months.
further, it was laid down in family courts act that majority of judges should be
women.
since family court has restrictive jurisdiction & does not have power to decide issues of contempt, people do not seem to take court as seriously as they would a magistrate or a city civil court.

lok adalats (2.33 pm)

it's indian innovation
lok adalat, meaning ‚Äòpeople‚Äôs court‚Äô is 1 of adr (alternative dispute redressal) mechanisms.
they are based on gandhian principles, aim to settle disputes through arbitration at grass-root level.
they were given statutory status under legal services authorities act, 1987 which aims to constitute legal service authorities to provide free legal services to weaker 
sections of society acc to article 39 a of indian constitution.
lok adalat is presided by a sitting or a retired judicial officer as chairman with 2 other 
members usually a lawyer & a social worker.
parties are not allowed to be represented by lawyers & encouraged to interact with a judge who helps in arriving at amicable settlement. 
no fee is paid by parties. a strict rule of civil procedural court & evidence is not applied. 
decision is by informal sitting & binding on parties & no appeal lies against order of lok adalat.
it disposes of large cases involving claims in form of motor vehicle accident claims,  electricity & water bill-related cases, land acquisition, matrimonial & family cases, cheque dishonor, etc.
criticism of lok adalats 
1) they meet infrequently & disposes of a large number of cases on a single day without 
giving parties enough time to discuss issue properly & arrive at a certain 
settlement (justice hurried is justice buried).
2) if parties do not arrive at a consensus, case is either returned to court of law or parties are advised to seek a remedy in court of law. it leads to unnecessary delays in dispensation of justice.
3) there are also instances of parties pressurizing their lawyers to stick up to strict procedures 
of court.

break (2.41 pm to 3.03 pm)

judicial activism & judicial overreach (3.05 pm)

under our constitutional scheme, judiciary has to enforce laws laid down by legislature in accordance with our constitution for which it has wide powers ranging from issuing writs of certain nature to entertainment of petitions by sp. leave, etc.
further, new innovations like concept of public interest litigations in recent times have led to enormous expansion of unaccountable judicial power in nation‚Äòs politics.
thus, exercise of judicial powers in a manner that leads to a redefinition of power equations b/w diff organs of state & judiciary is c/a judicial activism.
however, judicial activism doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that judiciary is inclined to expand its powers.
it's more about positive role played by judiciary owing to factors like a near collapse of responsible govt, a legislative vacuum due to coalition govts, & public confidence in judiciary. 
judicial activism when overtly exercised results in usurping powers of executive or legislature, which are other 2 important organs of governance & is c/a judicial overreach.
power to legislate is squarely conferred on legislature by constitution. no such legislative power is given to courts by constitution.
judicial activism cannot be used for filling up lacunae in legislation or for providing rights or creating liabilities not provided by legislation.
what did supreme court say in its recent judgment?
court said that judges should not peddle individual perceptions & notions of justice.
a judge‚Äôs solemn pledge has to remain embedded in constitution & laws.
apex court said if a judge considered himself or herself a ‚Äúcandle of hope‚Äù & took decisions under influence of such a notion, it might do more harm than good to society.
while using power 1 has to bear in mind that ‚Äòdiscipline‚Äô & ‚Äòrestriction‚Äô are 2 basic golden virtues within which a judge functions as per supreme court.
way forward
there is a very fine line b/w judicial activism & judicial overreach. it would be in best interest of our country if judges understand this & restrain themselves from crossing this line too often.
judiciary cannot rule nation by legislating as well as executing its judgments. it‚Äôs simply not meant to do that. it can rightly be argued that a legitimate judicial intervention is 1 that clearly falls within permissible scope of judicial review.
purely political questions & policy matters not involving decision of a core legal issue should therefore remain outside domain of judiciary. 
exs of judicial activism in india
1) persons in custody to be debarred from contesting elections 
2) persons in custody to be debarred from contesting elections 
3) sc ruling on appointments in central information commission
4) supreme court‚Äôs ruling on fixed tenure for bureaucrats
5) voter‚Äôs right to cast a negative vote (nota)

differences b/w supreme court & high court (3.16 pm)
