international relations class 13

class started at 1:15 pm

a brief overview of last class.

india srilanka relations (1:16 pm) - 
india srilanka relations (1:16 pm) - 

india's 1987 intervention in srilanka but inexorable tragedy.
india had few options & no good ones in 1987.
1. sharpening ethnic conflict in srilanka within tamil community.
2. it led to flow to tamil refuses in india.
3. india even witnessed fighting among sri lankan tamil militant groups on indian soil.
4. at same time, ethnic conflict was driving sri lankan govt to seek weapons from & rely on other countries such as china, pakistan, israel, & us.
this intervention therefore also attempt to prevent outside influences in srilanka & not leave a vacuum for others to fill in srilanka.
following india's movement out of srilanka, there were a series of massacres & assassinations in srilanka.
war had torn apart social fabric of country & economy was in ruins.
president chandrika bandaranaike's solution was to tie srilanka economy through fta with india.
she sought international mediation in conflict.
in 2000 both srilanka & ltte asked norway to mediate a solution.
india was only major power with a vital stake in sri lankan conflict.
reasons-
for domestic political reasons in tn
sl geopolitical location astride on major indian ocean sea lanes.
international community was driven to mediate in srilanka conflict for fear of further radicalization of srilankan tamil diaspora.
there were 4 such efforts at mediation all failed.
mahendra rajapaksa hardline leader was elected on promise to end ongoing war.
why  ltte a terrorist organization-
used civilians as human shields.
developed suicide bombing jacket.
war came to end in 2009 when sl govt finally killed prabhakaran & this 26-year long war finally ended.

role of india in last elam war (2:08 pm)
role of india in last elam war (2:08 pm)

india provided necessary intelligence to identify & destroy ships carrying arms & ammunition to tamil tigers.
india provided nonlethal weapons.
india's support was conditional or was based on understanding that after war with ltte is won sri lankan govt would devolve necessary power & authorities to northern & eastern provinces of sl & accept tamil as official language implement 13 amendments of indian constitution.
india's polity options in 4th elam war were limited. 
india recognized that a victorious mahendra rajapakse will be less dependent on india & therefore less responsive.
but sl had strong military-political & financial support on this war from china, pakistan, & to extent from usa.
if india had stood aside or asked him to resist, india in effect would be defending killers of indian pm & we would have written ourselves out of sl for next decade or so sacrificing our maritime & other interest in sl & abdicating a geopolitical strategic neighbor to other counties.
former nsa has mentioned that sl is aircraft carrier parked 14 miles of indian coast.
more than 19 % of indians foreign trade & 90% of supplies came across sloc that sl sits astride & therefore we can hardly abandon sl to potentially hostile influences.
perpetual dilemma of india's  sl policy -india must engage in order to defend our interest in keeping sl free of antagonistic outside influence while also trying to prevent growth of tamil extremism & separatism that could affect state of tn.
these 2 objectives are not perfectly aligned.
for much of 1980s & even today india's humanitarian impulses to protect human rights of tamil community & strategic interest full in diff directions.

international community & sl after war (2:31 pm)
international community & sl after war (2:31 pm)

since ltte was eliminated this meant calling sl govt to account & its human rights violation.
sl govt argued against international intervention claiming war to be sl internal affair in which it received support from china, russia, etc except india.
under international pressure, sl govt set up lessons learned & reconciliation commission.
it submitted its report in 2012 which sl govt is yet to implement.
in 2012-13 unhrc  brought a resolution against sl which india voted in favor of - 
despite india's strategic interest in sl 
 b/c of non - reconciliatory approach.
 b/c of indian tamil sentiments in favor of their brethren in sl & tamil regional parties being part of coalition govt at center.
however indian govt argued that it worked to mellow or soften resolutions against sl.

tamil issue in sl presently (2:42 pm)
tamil issue in sl presently (2:42 pm)

more than a decade after end of elam war tamil grievances have not yet been addressed.
majoritarian mahendra rajapaksa govt was replaced by mathripala srisena wickremesinghe who received support from tamil parties & return of rajapakshe govt, but none of govts have effectively addressed tamilian cause.
wickremesinghe has been identified as a pro-india pm but 13th amendment could not be implemented.
but effective majority govt has not been devolved to tamil majority provinces.
land acquired by sl govt during elam war has not been completely released to ordinary people. 
process of demanding land has not yet been completed.
tens of hundreds of sl tamils continue to live in camps.
therefore political solutions for war-torn tamil areas remain.
break at 2:55 pm to 3:14 pm

china & srilanka (3:14 pm)
china & srilanka (3:14 pm)
reasons for sl embrace of china -
sl is suspicious to apprehensive of india with respect to tamils.
in 2020 indian govt took 5 months to approve a loan moratorium of 500 million $ while china approved a 500 million $ loan in no time.
chinas deep pockets- given precarious finances of island, china is discussing full debt restructuring of srilankan borrowings & has extended a currency swap arrangement of 1.5 billion dollars.
evidence of china's presence in sl - eg a 99-year lease on hambantota port.
chinese investment in colombo international financial city, colombo international container terminal.
china has diversified its investment in agriculture, plantation & food processing, etc.
consequence of china's presence - economic engagement with china is not without ramifications for colombo-
sl has been forced into a debt trap in china.
while india & western countries have emphasized rising chinese debt on sl, sl is more tolerant of it.
china has already changed nature of assistance to sl.
earlier china used to advance loans as project loans which could not be used to take care of bop crisis.
since 2020 is moving towards syndicate loans where sl is free to decide on its use as necessary.
debt equity swap- under which china has acquired hambantota port on a 99-year lease.
sl has in fact become poster child of china's expansion by debt policy by targeting vulnerable countries.

india's engagement with sl (3:59 pm)
india's engagement with sl (3:59 pm)

india has performed much better with its developmental assistance program to sl.
suwa seriya ambulance service in sl .
indian govt-funded introduction of these ambulances & even trained staff in hyderabad.
sl benefits from india itec program.
since 2017 students from sl can also appear for neet & iit jee advance exams.
india has taken up a housing project whereby it has built 60000 houses in sl since 2017 including 14000 in plantation areas.
in last 5 years, india has undertaken high-impact development projects in central &  southern provinces.
this is in keeping with india's new policy of spreading out beyond tamil areas.
india's development assistance covers diverse areas such as education, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, etc.
in infrastructure sector - india has leased out matalla airport for 40 years in 2018.
in february 2021 rajapakse cabinet terminated 2009 agreement with respect to ect project of colombo port.
it was india- japan joint venture with 49% equity & rest with sl.
it was a major setback for india & sl.
however, sl has offered with greenfield project of wct to adani group of india with its local partners.
port development has become technologically intensive, therefore sl govt has explained private investment into terminal over purely strategic investments by govts.
agreement to build, operate & transfer will be valid for 35 years.
sl seeking to assuage indian concerns with respect to china & sl.
agreement on development of trincomalee oil tank farms.
srilankan foreign secretary articulated that sl wants to pursue a "neutral " foreign policy but it will retain india 1st in security & strtef=gic matters.
thus in terms of strategic security sl has clarified that it will follow india 1st policy.
sl has clarified that it has no intention to serve as a threat to india rather it wants to benefit from india.
sl foreign policy secretary has clarified that while sl will engage with other economic power for economic reasons india would be their primary strategic partner.
steps were taken by goi-
1. to assuage sl concerns wrt india support to tamil cause.
pm modi during his 2017 visit to sl, for possibly 1st time modi didn't visit jaffna which had become customary for visiting indian dignitaries.
rather he traveled to central east to visit indian origin tamils in sl.
modi's visit highlighted how india had ignored their plight while preferring to fight for sl tamils.
india has sought to harness cultural-religious ties with sl.
buddhism is new cultural-religious arm of modi govt diplomatic outreach into sl to foster relations.
a four-pronged initiative has been agreed to revamp india's sl relation in terms of economic crisis in sl-
line of credit towards import of fuel & medicines.
