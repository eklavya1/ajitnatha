press freedom index is an annual ranking of countries compiled & *published by* reporters without borders since [[2002]] based upon the organisation's own assessment of the countries' press freedom records in the previous year. it intends to reflect the degree of freedom that journalists, news organisations, & netizens have in each country, & the efforts made by authorities to respect this freedom. reporters without borders is careful to note that the index only deals with press freedom & does not measure the quality of journalism in the countries it assesses, nor does it look at human rights violations in general.
