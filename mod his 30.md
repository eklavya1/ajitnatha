### BENGAL FAMINE 1943 (under Linlithgow)

# ******************************
## Political developments from 1944 to 1947

### Lord Wavell (1943-47)
Commander in chief during Linlithgow (1936-43)
Wavell Plan 1945
INA's Imphal campaign 1945
INA agitations 1945
Naval ratings strike 1946
Elections during 1945-46

### C RAJAGOPALACHARI Formula 1944
[[c rajagopalachari]]
Aka Rajaji formula aka CR Formula
Aim: Territorial integrity and INC-ML unity
Disputes: ML Pakistan resolution 1940; ML didn't support QIM 1942; During Cripps Mission 1942, ML was adamant on 2 constituent assemblies
Proposals:
	ML supports Purna Swaraj
	Interim coalition govt of INC and ML at the center
	Plebiscite post-war in Muslim majority areas of East and West based on Joint electorate
	If the vote is in favor of partition, then a weak but common center will be created. 
	Above to be implemented after Br leave
Result:
	MG-Jinnah talks failed as Jinnah wanted: only Muslims to vote in Plebiscite; Not a common center but Pakistan; Implement before Br leave.
	Sikhs opposed partition 
	VD Savarkar and SP Mookherjee rejected partition

### Desai Liaqat Pact 1945
Goal: INC-ML unity via Joint interim govt at the center.
Proposed Viceroy's EC 
All Indians except GG and C-I-C
with 50% INC Ministers and 50% ML ministers
Proposed Federal Assembly:
20% Minorities esp Sikhs and SC
50% INC nominated and 50% ML nominated
Gandhiji supported it, Jinnah denied its existence. 
Result: Failed

### Wavell Plan 1945 (Shimla Conference 1945)
Why? Churchill wanted a solution before elections in Britain
Viceroy's EC (VEC)
All Indians except GG and CIC with 50% Hindu ministers and 50% Muslim ministers
Appointment: Nominations sought from political parties either in form of a Joint list or a separate list
Functioning of VEC:
Viceroy to rule on the advice of ministers with veto power
Portfolio of foreign affairs office to Indians.
INC-ML@ Wavell Plan 1945:
ML rejected as it wanted all Muslim Ministers to be from ML
INC refused ML demand
Result: Wavell announced failure due to lack of failure of INC-ML consensus. This gave an implicit veto to ML.

### INA-Azad Hind Fauj

#### 1st Phase
Mohan Singh went to the Japanese who gave him PoWs to raise INA
Fall of Singapore in 1942: 40,000 joined INA
Rash Behari Bose took leadership of INA

#### 2nd Phase
The arrival of Bose in Singapore in July 1943
Bose took over leadership from an aged RB Bose
General Tojo," Japan doesn't want to annex India"
Bose set up a "Provisional" govt of free India (Oct 1943) with INA HQs in Rangoon and Singapore.
Other Aspects:
Azad Hind Radio
Women Regiment called Rani Jhansi regiment
Imphal Campaign (1944): INA and JAP ATTACKED INDIA BURMABORDER BUT FAILED

### Events Post Wavell Plan
Clement Atlee came to Power and announced Elections in INDIA
Simultaneously 1st INA TRIALS of Prem SEHGAL, SHAH NAWAZ, and GURDAKSH SINGH DHILLON 1944 
Dec 1945: ELECTIONS TO CENTRAL & Provincial Legislatures (At Centre Gol ACT 1919 and at Provinces Got ACT 1935)
CABINET Mission announcers in JAN 1846 of arrival and in FEB1946 A DAY BEFORE ARRIVAL Strike BY NAVAL RATINGS

### INA TRIALS & INA AGITATIONS
1st INA TRIALS of Prem SEHGAL SHAH NAWAZ & DHILLON in 1945
This resulted in a mass upsurge after which inc used INA trials for elections
Inc stand not Br but India should decide the fate of ina men
Nehru, Tej Bahadur Sapru,  Bholabhai Desai, Etc Defeded In Courts
Importance:
	Truly all Indian participation
	INA truly unified India
	Participation was greater than QIM
Methods of agitation:
	High militancy
	Pamphlets in Delhi
	Funds contributed by Bollywood, Gurudwaras, NRIs
	INA Day and INA week celebrations
	Some govt officials openly supported

### The revolt by Naval ratings
Armed forces supported INA agitations
Air force men attended INA meetings
Impact: CIC suggested a lenient approach to govt over INA trials
3 upsurges (winter of 1945-56): 2 in Calcutta (Forward Bloc and ML) and 1 in Bombay by Naval ratings
Pattern in upsurges
Strike by Naval ratings due to low-quality food, sympathy for INA trials; feared job loss, opposed use of Indian troops in Indonesia.
Actions (eg: wrote "Quit India" on HMIS Talwar)
Participation limited

Impact: 
Br realized that if the cabinet mission fails then the next movt will overthrow them violently
Br feared disaffection in the army if inc & ml begin supporting naval ratings
Communal unity was temporary as Muslim ratings went to ml Hindu ratings to inc
Not the whole army revolted it was a Maratha battalion that suppressed the ratings

### 1945 elections
Elections to CLA & PLCs HELD
INC GOT MAJORITY Seats everywhere Except Bengal PUNJAB & Sind
Election campaigns

### Cabinet Mission (Feb-May 1946)
Led by Pethick Lawrence, Stafford Cripps, and AV Alexander

Goal: Peaceful transfer of power and setting up of a constituent assembly
Reasons: End to Br domination; economic woes of Br after WW2, etc

Proposals:
No two constituent assemblies and no veto to ML but Br won't accept a constitution not based on INC-ML consensus.
An advisory committee will be formed-> on Rights of citizens, minorities, and Tribals
A weak common center
Provincial autonomy over all subjects other than 3 Union subjects and residuary powers to provinces
Provinces to be divided into 3 sections (A, B, C). 

Section A :
Hindu majority provinces
Bombay, Madras, UP, CP, Bihar, Orissa

Section B:
Muslim majority provinces in NW
Sindh, Punjab, NWFP

Section C:
Muslim majority provinces in Bengal and Assam

Debates in relation to Cabinet mission:
INC Stand: Provinces should have a right not to join a group; there should be elected representatives from Princely states
ML: Grouping is compulsory and thus partition is implicit.
Call for Direct Action by ML-> communal riots in Calcutta where 5000 died
Implementation of Cabinet mission
CA set up by Aug 1946
Interim govt set up in Sep 1946
CA was split into 2 by Mountbatten Plan

The topic for the next class: Mountbatten Plan, Indian Independence Act, Many voices of nation
