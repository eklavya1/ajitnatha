directive principles of state policy (in continuation‚Ä¶)
mains question was discussed.
does right to a clean environment entail legal regulations on burning crackers during diwali? discuss in light of article 21 of indian constitution & judgment (s) of apex court in this regard.

# article 21
rights included/ implicit in it's right to clean environment.

# article 25: right to religion/ ‚Äúessential practice‚Äù- right to burn crackers is not essential practices‚Äù.
right to religion is not absolute right. it's subject to public order, health & morality.

# mc mehta case
criticism of dpsp
they are non-justiciable in nature- 1 cannot approach court. they are only ‚Äúhollow words‚Äù.
some of them are orthodox in nature. eg- gandhian principles.
some dpsps are vague in nature. eg- state will create a ‚Äúwelfare state‚Äù.
some of them are in direct conflict with frs. eg- article 39 (b) & (c) against articles 14 & 19.
put a financial burden on state.

# significance
fundamental to governance of country (article 37)
guiding principles for any govt in power- it's political responsibility of state.
sanction behind dpsp is political.
helps in interpretation of constitution.
bring consistency in governance
establish a social & economic democracy in india.

# part iv a (fundamental duties)

it was added by 42nd constitution amendment act, 1976.
there is only 1 article 51a.
it was based on recommendation of [[swaran singh committee]]
originally, there were 10 fundamental duties.
now, 1 more has been added.
they are applicable to all citizens.
they are non-enforceable in nature.
they were taken from ussr.
some of them are vaguely worded.

# opinion of supreme court on fundamental duties

state can make laws to prevent violation of fundamental duties even though they are not enforceable in court by themselves
fds cannot be enforced through writs 

‚Ä¢ they are only confined to citizens
* it's important for citizens to not demand only rights but also perform duties
while judging constitutionality of law court shall uphold law if it seeks to implement a provision under fundamental duties.

# part v (union)

article 52 to article 151.
chapter 1- article 52-78 (union executive)
chapter 2 article 79-122 (parliament)
chapter 3 article 123 (ordinance making)
chapter 4 article 124-147 (union judiciary)

# chapter 5 cag

# article 52
there shall be a president for india & president should be for all times.
he is head of state & representative

difference b/w presidential & parliamentary form of democracy
presidential 	parliamentary 

president is de jure & de facto head of govt.

it's also c/a westminister model of democracy.
president- de jure
pm- defacto head of govt

strict sop b/w organs of state.

sop is flexible/ fluid

govt is more stable but less responsible- in presidential democracy, president & his executive are not dependent on legislature for their survival.

govt is less stable but more responsible- in parliamentary democracy, they continue to be in power as long as they enjoy support of legislature.

talent can be infused from outside, providing overall options to president for executive.

talent pool is limited to legislature. only legislators can become members of executive.

deadlock b/w executive & legislature.

deadlock is not possible.

decision-making is swift.

decision-making is slow.

# why did we choose parliamentary democracy?
prefer responsibility for [[stability]]
familiarity with british system (goi act, 1935). _related_ [[psychology#^f681e6]]
powers are diffused whereas in presidential democracy powers are concentrated in hands of 1 person. it may lead to dictatorship.
it's more inclusive in nature because parliamentarians come from diverse societies. _related_ [[donald trump]]
