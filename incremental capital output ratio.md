- it refers to amount of [[capital]] required to increase output by 1 unit from existing level of [[output]].
- icor = incremental/output (ideally we desire a lower value)
- higher icor worse or difficult it's for economy to produce 1 extra unit of output.
- *lower icor is desirable*.
- when govt spent more than taxes, it crowds out private investment which leads to less money being available for private firms to invest.
