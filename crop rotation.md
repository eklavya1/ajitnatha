it's practice of growing diff crops in regular succession in same field.
this practice controls insects and diseases, increases soil fertility and decreases soil erosion.
generally, soil cannot sustain continuous cropping with high yielding single crop  b/c certain nutrients required by crop get exhausted totally 
while others remain unutilized leading to a serious nutrient
imbalance in soil and encouraging certain diseases and pests.
sowing a leguminous crop (e.g. green gram) as a rotational crop is very useful  b/c legumes enhance nitrogen levels in soil, reduce need for chemical nitrogen fertilizer.
it's possible to grow 2 or sometimes 3 diff crops in succession on same land within a year is k/a multiple cropping.
this practice can go on for some time, but land cannot maintain a high yield in long run.
crop rotation takes into amount foll factors:
o leguminous crop should be grown after non-leguminous crops.
o crops that require less water ([[irrigation]]) should be grown after 1 that requires more [[water]].
crops requiring less manure should be sown after 1 that requires more manure.
geoponic refers to growing plants in normal soil.
aquaponics is symbiotic [[environment]] of [[aquaculture]] and [[hydroponics]].
