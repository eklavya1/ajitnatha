	- National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is the Government of India’s pioneering initiative to establish a medium-term pipeline along with a roadmap for “monetisation ready” assets. Developed in the backdrop of the unprecedented Covid-induced economic and fiscal shocks, NMP lists out core assets and asset classes, under various [[infrastructure]] ministries, which will be monetised over a period of time. 
	- It aims to unlock value in brownfield projects by engaging the private sector, transferring to them revenue rights and not ownership in the projects, and using the funds so generated for infrastructure creation across the country.
	- In a monetisation transaction, the government is basically transferring revenue rights to private parties for a specified transaction period in return for upfront money, a revenue share, and commitment of investments in the assets.
	- Monetization through [[disinvestment]] and monetization of non-core assets (such as land, building, and pure-play real estate assets) have not been included in the NMP.
	- Monetization of assets unlocks their value, eliminates their holding cost and enables scarce public funds to be deployed to new projects, thus speeding up the implementation of the National Infrastructure Pipeline.The NMP will run co-terminus with the **National Infrastructure Pipeline** of Rs 100 lakh crore announced in December [[2019]]. The estimated amount to be raised through monetisation is around 14% of the proposed outlay for the Centre of Rs 43 lakh crore under NIP.
	- Generally, Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), for instance, are the key structures used to monetise assets in the roads and power sectors. Monetisation under NMP would be through infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) route.
