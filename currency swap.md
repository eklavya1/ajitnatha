- In finance, a currency swap (more typically termed a cross-currency swap, XCS) is an interest rate derivative (IRD).
- In particular it is a linear IRD, and one of the most liquid benchmark products spanning multiple currencies simultaneously. It has pricing associations with interest rate swaps (IRSs), foreign exchange (FX) rates, and FX swaps (FXSs).
