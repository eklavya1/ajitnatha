A brief review about the last class.

Scramble for Africa (5:02 PM)

During early colonialism(pre-1870)human resources of Africa were exploited via the slave trade on the West coast of Africa.
Slave trade continued for 300 years and millions of Africans were forced into slavery initially by individual merchants and later by slave trading companies.
This was trans Atlantic Slave trade and Africans were transported in inhumane conditions to work as slaves in plantations systems of the Americas.
Many of them were also sold in Europe.
Therefore it was also known as the triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas.
Britain banned slavery in 1833 and US in 1865.
In coastal Africa, there were some European colonies eg South Africa was colonized by Dutch by setting up a cape colony in 1652.
Since 1830, France controlled Algeria.
France was also present in Senegal.
However internal Africa was called the dark continent.
Because it wasn't explored until the 1870s and there was a lack of knowledge about internal Africa among Europeans.
In 1870 explorers published details about the wealth of internal Africa and proved that rivers of internal Africa were navigable.
This attracted the attention of European powers who needed raw materials resources for industrialization.
However, it was King Leopold II of Belgium in 1876 who was the first to establish a colony and now a race or scramble for Africa began.
And from 1876-to 1914 whole of Africa was colonized.
The conflicts between European powers for colonies contributed to WW1.
Only Abyssinia/Ethiopia was independent.
In 1896 Italy tried but failed to colonize it in the Battle of Adowa. 
Abyssinia had somewhat militarised itself with help of Russia and Italy underestimated it.
Liberia was set up as a free colony by the US for the voluntary relocation of lakhs from the US to Africa.
Conflicts -Britain vs France over Sudan, Egypt, and the Niger river valley.
France vs Italy over Tunis and Libya.
Italy felt left out as it was a late entrant to colonialism.
France had occupied Algeria in 1830 and Tunis in 1881.
This led to rivalry between Italy and France.
France vs Spain over Morocco.
Portugal vs Belgium had some territorial disputes in the congo river valley as Belgium desired excess to sea and Portugal had an interest in Angola.
Germany and  France were neighbors and therefore rivals.
 Also in the 1870 franco Prussian war, France lost Alsace Lorraine.
The post-1870 German economy and naval power expanded rapidly and Germany became the second power of Europe.
But France had a bigger colonial empire and Germany desired 2nd largest colonial empire in line with its power status.
Their rivalry manifested in Morocco.
Morocco was strategically located at the mouth of the Mediterranean sea and it also faced the Atlantic ocean.
Germany feared that if France colonized Morocco then it could threaten German trade.
Therefore Germany wanted morocco to be neutral i.e open door policy in Morroco.

Berlin Conference  1885 (5:56 PM)

An eg of conflict resolution via diplomacy as many territorial disputes over colonies in Africa were resolved here.
Most modern borders of African countries are the product of this conference.
Africa was partitioned by table mapping that is by drawing lines on a map of Africa based on negotiation between European powers and without any participation of Africans and without any concern for parameters usually taken into account by demarcating borders.
Provisions- Upper Niger is recognized as France and lower Niger valley to Britain.
Congo was recognized as a private colony of King Leopold II and was also given access to the sea.
In return, King Leopold II gave freedom of trade and navigation in Congo to all powers.
Freedom of navigation to all in the Congo River and Niger river.
French special right over Tunis recognized.
Spain's special right over western Sahara was recognized.
Germany got recognition for its colonies - German east Africa, German Southwest Africa, Cameroon, and Togoland.

France in Africa / Germany vs France (6:21 PM)

France captured Algeria
1844-war between Morocco and France where France defeats Morroco because morocco supported Algerians since 1830.
1860- Spain invades Morroco .
1870s-Morocco wanted to be a US protectorate but the desire was not fulfilled because of the policy of isolation of the US since 1823.
1880- Madrid conference - territorial neutrality of Morroco guaranteed.
Germany got the right to be consulted before any change in Morroco.
Freedom of trade to all.
1900- France and Italy reached an agreement.
Italy has special rights over Libya.
France has special rights over Morocco.
Libya was annexed in 1911 by Italy.
1904- Entente Cordiale between French and Britain.
Britain will take over Egypt and Sudan and theFrench have special rights over Morocco.
1904 morocco divided into french Morroco and Spanish Morroco.

1905-06 - Morrocan crisis (6:41 PM)

Germany felt isolated in morocco and a conference where all powers sided with France and Germany was forced to agree to french control over Moroccan banks and police.
Therefore Germany felt isolated further.

1911 -Agadir Crisis (6:45 PM)

France stationed its troops in Morocco.
In response, Germany captured Agadir island of morocco by sending its navy.
They created anxiety in Britain as with control of Agadir Germany could threaten British trade in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.
Britian was also anxious about the rising naval power of Germany saw it as a threat to its colonial empire.
A conference was held and Germany was again isolated and forced to agree to french control of Morocco.
In return, it was given a small strip of land in French Congo.
Germany felt humiliated and anti-British and anti-France sentiments increased in Germany.

Egypt- 6:55 PM

eg-1859-69 Suez canal built.
1876-Egypt defaults on loans taken from Britain and France for industrialization and now Britain and France took control of Egypt's budget.
1882 -Egyptian army revolted due to nonpayment of salaries and high taxes.
This led to political control of Britain and France over Egypt.
1904- Entente cordiale i.e Britain got full control of Egypt and Sudan.
1922- Britain gave independence but the Suez canal continued under British control.
And a 1936 treaty allowed the presence of British troops in Suez city.

Impact of colonialism in Africa(7:02 PM)

In colonies where white settlers settled eg High no of settlers in the east and southern Africa in British colonies-Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa,French in Algeria
Where white settlers settled they exploited the natives and become local elites.
Land grabbing
Captured the economy.
Landowners and industrialists were wiped while blacks were farm labor and workers in factories.
Blacks had no right to vote and no representation.
Political control with whites.
Religious conversion and neglect of black culture and language.
Racism and separateness.
Separate schools, buses, townships, beaches, etc
There existed a nexus between white settlers and colonial powers and the former enjoyed military protection later.
White settlers are agents on the ground for better exploitation of blacks.
This nexus broke post-WW2 especially post 1958 when Britain wanted to bring black majority rule and then white settlers of zimbabwe and south Africa declared independence.
Where there was absentee colonialism I,e the presence of foreign administration on the ground the conditions were worse eg in Portugal colonies of Angola and Mozambique and Belgian Congo there was a lack of development and no focus on health, education, and economy.
Colonial power was only interested in the extraction of resources and military control.
 In 1975 Angola there were a handful of doctors, graduates, etc.
Wherever blacks opposed colonialism there were mass killings and suppression. eg King Leopold II regime from 1876-1908 killed 10 million in Congo and there was rampant child labor eg for rubber extraction from trees and if parents opposed hands of children were cut.
Arbitrary borders-Africa was partitioned based on the power status of European powers.
Therefore there came to exist arbitrary borders as factors like cultural homogeneity, so a geographical country is also a cultural nation with unity.
Natural resource availability and diversity.
Geographical continuity.
population quantum and quality of the human resource.
Nature of economy, self-sufficiency was not taken into account.
This had negative impacts -
The tribal rivalry continued even after independence.
In Rwanda 5 lakh people were killed in a week in 1994 due to clashes between Hutus and Tutsis.
Prior to independence, colonial powered one tribe to control other tribes i,e the policy of divide and rule.
In many cases, different tribes came together for independent struggle.
However post-independence rivalry remerged.
And this hurt internal stability as there was a series of Who encountered who.
Many African countries were single item export economies.
And due to lack of development, they became dependent on single item export earnings.
If prices of the items crashed in the international market then their economies crashed.

Neo-colonialism (7:42 PM)

That is exploitation and domination by foreign powers even after political independence.
African countries after independence became dependent on loans from ex-colonial powers and institutions like IMF and World bank.
The aid or loans came with conditionalities.
Therefore foreign elements continue to dominate policy in African countries.
Lenders wanted repayment of loans and therefore African governments prevented spending on welfare measures in health, education, etc.
Also, ex-colonial powers continue to dominate the economy of ex-colony in many cases and also militarily intervene to maintain law and order.
Due to the slave trade, human resource exploitation continued as colonial powers raised an army from among colonies and Africans died fighting for colonial interest in WW1 and WW2.
