CAQM is taking steps to effectively tackle dust pollution emanating from roads, right of way and open areas spread across the National Capital Region (NCR).
To this end, directions have been issued by CAQM to all road owning/ maintaining/ road construction agencies of the State [[government]] of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), Rajasthan, Haryana and GNCTD to set up Dust Control & Management Cells in their respective states.
The Cell will regularly monitor the compliance of road dust control measures by the authorities concerned and will also keep track of the progress of measures undertaken. Apart from this, exhaustive reports prepared on a monthly basis by the cell will help in the fight against dust pollution more systematically.
**10-point dust monitoring parameter**
CAQM has formulated a 10-point dust monitoring parameter in this regard.
This parameter involves a variety of measures that needs to be strictly adopted by the Dust Control & Management Cells.
**These measures include**
optimum utilization of road sweeping machines,
scientific disposal of dust collected in designated sites/ landfills,
water sprinkling to suppress dust especially after mechanized sweeping,
augmentation of mechanized sweeping and sprinkling capacity,
proper management of roads to ensure potholes-free roads,
laying or repairing roads in a manner that extensively supports mechanized sweeping,
conversion of non-paved roadsides into paved one or into a green area,
greening of central verges,
laying cemented roads over bituminous roads especially in industrial areas and,
identification of hotspots of road dust and target-specific implementation of road dust control measures.
