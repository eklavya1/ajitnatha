the 35th Constitutional Amendment Act (1974) was enacted by the parliament. This amendment introduced a new class of statehood under the constitution by conferring on Sikkim the status of an ‘associate state’ of the Indian Union. For this purpose, a new Article 2A and a new schedule (Tenth Schedule conseriving the terms and conditions of association) were inserted in the Constitution. *This experiment, however, did not last long as it could not fully satisfy the aspirations of the people of Sikkim.* In a referendum held in 1975, they voted for the abolition of the institution of Chogyal and Sikkim becoming an integral part of India. Consequently, the [[36 caa|36th Constitutional Amendment Act]] ([[1975]]) was enacted to make Sikkim a full-fledged state of the Indian Union (the 22nd state). ^9e2d52
