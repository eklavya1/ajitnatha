the bering strait (russian: берингов пролив) is a strait between the pacific and arctic oceans, separating the chukchi peninsula of the russian far east from the seward peninsula of alaska. the present russia-united states maritime boundary is at 168° 58' 37" w longitude, slightly south of the arctic circle at about 65° 40' n latitude. the strait is named after vitus bering, a danish explorer in the service of the russian empire.

the bering strait has been the subject of the scientific theory that humans migrated from asia to north america across a land bridge known as beringia when lower ocean levels – perhaps a result of glaciers locking up vast amounts of water – exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor, both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it. this view of how paleo-indians entered america has been the dominant one for several decades and continues to be the most accepted one. numerous successful crossings without the use of a boat have also been recorded since at least the early 20th century.
