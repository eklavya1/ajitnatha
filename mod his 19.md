3.  所以 [[Indian National movement]] leadership changed ==من conservatives to [[moderates]]==

## organizations
1. indian association 的 [[surendranath bannerjea tk]] (1876) 为 representing د 人 
2. _poona sarvajanik sabha_ formed 里 [[1870]] 被 [[mg ranade]], 它 collected 17000 signatures من peasants a 力 的 autonomy ie proof 的 them representing د peasants

## drawbacks
1. they came من same elite background 的 landed class 比如 -zamindars , belonged to 高 class, many times fought 为 interests 的 zamindars , 比如 - opposed [[bengal]] tenancy [[acts 行为]] 1885 里 legislative council  ^a8b22f
2. belonged to 高 caste, 所以  不 get much support 的 د lower caste, they 不 focus on د grievances 的 د lower class
3. they 有 [[hindu]] identity 所以 muslims were alienated, 比如  - [[1893]], cow protection riots took place--> moderates 不 condemn د riots 哪 alienated د [[muslim]]s
# ******************************
# foundation 的 [[indian national congress]] [[1885]]
1. [[safety valve theory]] - [[a.o. hume]], [[lord dufferin]] (8488) 和 moderates came 一起 to prevent an [[1857]] like mass uprising as [[indian national congress]] will [[acts 行为]] as a vent/safety valve + moderates 能 帮 brits prevent uprising
2. origin- ==wedderburn== 里 biography 的 ao hume claimed, + mentioned 那 hume received 七 volumes 的 sec[[reports tk|ret rep]]orts من religious 人 哪 给 信息 on an impending uprising
3.  它 过 false, 因为 七 volumes 过 从不 found, د archiving 的 dufferin (8488) records, revealed 那 他 不 take hume seriously + despised moderates 和 不 considered them to be representative 的 人
4. lord dufferin
5. 第一 都 印度 political organisation
6. [[wc bannerjee]] 过 د 第一 president #pre 
7. major role 过 played 被 ao hume, who 过 د founding member 和 an 比如 -civil servant, sympathetic to 印度
8. william wedderburn 也 founding member, 也 比如 - civil servant #pre 
9. even if brits 要 to 用 [[indian national congress]] as a safety valve , د 印度 leaders 用 hume as a "lightning conductor" [[winston churchill#^b6aa7b]]

## english social reformers
### AO Hume
- 他 帮 overcome differences 中 regional 印度 leaders 和 convinced them to come under 1 banner ie [[indian national congress]], however, even without hume [[george friedman#^5642c6]], all india org would have been 生 if not sooner than later
- proof- pre [[1885]], pol agitation were on د rise ie, 有 ↑ pol activity
- non 的 د demands 的 د 印度 leaders were met 被 د brits, 所以 印度 leaders were already realising a need 为 an all 印度 org to put 高 pressure on د brits
- [[1877]]- imperial darbar, journalists invited across [[india]] to imperial darbar formed an 都 印度 org 里 form 的 ==native press association== 哪 是 pan-indian 里 nature under `surendranath bannerjea` as nat'l president (他 是 editor 的 د `baozhi "BENGALEE"`) #pre 
- 印度 association 的 [[surendranath bannerjea tk]] had organized national conference 里 [[1883]] 里 calcutta 和 next 过 scheduled 里 [[1885]]
- [[gopal krishna gokhale]] 说 - brits would 从不 have allowed an all 印度 org to be 生 if there was an absence 的 british men, 因为 的 past anxieties 的 [[1857]] 反叛 [[revolt of 1857]] 和 ↑ing pol activities pre-[[1885]]
# ******************************
# ideology 的 د moderates, their +,-,demands 和 methods (moderate phase 的 [[indian national congress]] 1885-1907)
- believed 里 [[utalitarianism]], ie 用 的 legal reforms 为 improving governance , 所以 过 champions 的 constitutionalism, 要 ethical rule 被 د brit
- they 过 aware 的 exploitative nature 的 brit rule, however 也 believed 
		- 印度 人 是 不 ready 为 全 self-governance, 比如 - [[dadabhai naoroji tk]] (过 a moderate) 说 - 它 would be a calamity if brits left 印度
		- 所以 they believed 里 benevolence 的 brits
		- they believed 那 brits 能 modernize 印度 via estd 的 modern [[_polity moc]] based on 民主 [[c9 ch-5 democratic rights]] [[c10 ch-3 Democracy and Diversity]] 和 mod 经济 based on [[capitalism 资本主义]] ([[capitalism]])
		- their goal until disappointment 的 印度 理事会 行为 [[1852]] was limited self - governance within brit rule
		- they 有 secular ideology
- what did moderates mean 被 limited self governance when they demanded 它 as part 的 [[indian national congress]] (1885-92)
	- demands 为 changes led to 
			- [[印度 理事会 acts 行为 1861]]
			- [[印度 理事会 行为 1892]]
			- [[indian councils act 1909]]
	- demands 为 changes led to 
			- `印度 理事会 行为 1861`
					- reasons-
							- post-1857, brits 要 cooperation 的 印度 里 some form
							- they looked towards zamindars who had benefitted من brit rule 和 supported [[britain]] 里 1857 反叛
							- ica1861 所以 allowed some participation to 印度 里 governance
					- provisions
						-  它 was د 第一 attempts at representative governance ie 第一 time any form 的 participation was 给 to 印度 人 里 law making 
						-  所以 this 行为 introduced a "[[grain]] 的 popular element" (不 elections) , just 那 印度  人 是 included 里 legislative council 
						-   它 allowed 为 印度人 to be **nominated** to legislative branch [[viceroy|的 د vic]]eroy's council
						-   第一 three 印度 人 were-
								-   raja 的 benaras
								-   maharaja 的 patiala
								-   sir dinkar rao
						-   there was formal bifurcation 的 viceroy's council into
								-   legislative council (imperial)
								-   imperial executive council
						-   viceroy could 现在 nominate 6-12 additional members to ILc 的 哪 half must be non-officials  (brit 商业 人 , brit philanthropists, 印度 人)
								-   grievances 的 د 印度 人 -
										-   only loyalist elements like zamindars, moneylenders , br 商业人 
										-   from 1861 的 92, only 45 印度 人 were nominated
										-   functioning  的 ilc 或 how ilc 的 1861 was 不 a parliament 
												-   不 discussion was allowed wout prior approval 的 viceroy
												-   不 discussion allowed on actions 的 administration
												-   prior approval 的 viceroy was needed 为 introduction  的 bills 里 ilc 1861
												-   viceroy 有 veto 力 余 د bill
						-   executive
								-   legally recognized portfolio 制度 以后 1857 被 canning 56[[education|62]] (1856-62) ie 教学  的 departments to members 的 viceroy  的 executive ie ministries were introduced , these members 有 final authority 余 decisions  的 their dept, 只 重要 decisions were decided 被 executive council as a whole
								-   ica 1861 introduced "law making 被 ordinance" has life 的 六 months, 力 was 跟 د viceroy
								-   viceroy got 力 to create 新 provinces + 力 to appoint lieutenant governors 为 these provinces
						-   开始 [[Decentralisation]]  [centralization 开始 [[regulating act of 1773]] + peaked 跟 charter [[acts 行为]] 的 1833], (peak 的 [[decentralisation]] = GoI 行为 1935 跟 formation  的 ministries 被 elected 印度 人 里 province)
						-   ica 1861 restored legislative 力 to [[bombay]] 和 madras (like 今天  there is concept 的 cental list, [[state list]]), 所以  decentralisation من viceroy to governors (SHIFT 的 力) + 新 legislative council 是 也 proposed, 比如  - 为 bengal, 为 punjab, 为 [[NWFP]]
						-   provisions 为 functioning plc 的 were similar to those 的 ilc
						-   non-official members 的 plc were to be nominated 被 viceroy
						-   some bills could be introduced 只 以后 prior approval 的 viceroy
						-   province 不 有 只 budget making 力
						-   provincial budgets came 里 [[1919]]
						-   at policy level-  د centre-都 印度 related [[policies]] was 里  [[london]] 里 form 的 印度 council (estd 被 goi 行为 1858, 有 15 members headed 被 secretary 的 state 为 印度) demand was  to abolish  它 
				-   legislature
						-  ilc 和 plz should be expanded to  include 更 印度 人
						-  atleast 50% members  的 lc should be elected members , (不 nomination 但 有  election ) {did they demand direct election ? --> 不 是 , they 要 indirect elections}
						-  ie members 的 د lc elected 被  د members  的 local bodies 
						-  there demand was- 印度ianization 的 civil services
								-  里 [[1833]], lower bureaucracy was 开 up 为 印度 人 
								-  [[1853]]-[[test 考试]] 为 `civil services` technically 印度人 能 变得 senior officials
								-  1817- statutory civil services where 印度 人 能 nominated to posts held 被 [[欧洲]] 人 to senior positions , 但 只 loyalist elements 和 很 少
								-  1892- covenanted civil services renamed to ics (印度 civil services )
									-  statutory civil services were abolished 
									-  uncovenanted civil services were changed to provincial civil services 
								-  [[1919]]- exam to be held 里 印度
								-  印度ianization will ↓ [[expenditure]] on salaries, 所以  will ↓ د tax burden on 印度 人 
								-  it will ↓ drain 的 财富 from 印度 , 因为  د 欧洲 were 里 印度 只 temporarily 和 they ultimately spent 都these salary 里 [[britain]]
								-   它 will be a measure against racism
								-   军 [[expenditure]] - demand - that britain should share this expenditure
								-   demand 为 volunteer services  ie 印度 人 be allowed to join 军 voluntarily
								-   result- 不 met, 因为 brits feared entry 的 natonalist 印度 人 和 repeat 的 1857
								-   to 有 印度 人 at senior levels 
								-   result- 只 以后 [[1931]] (rtc, round table conf) nominated to senior levels + 只 里 WW2 that many 印度 人 promoted to senior levels
