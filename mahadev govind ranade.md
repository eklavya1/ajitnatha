Rao Bahadur Mahadev Govind Ranade (18 January 1842 â€“ 16 January 1901), popularly referred to as Justice Ranade, was an Indian scholar, social reformer, judge and author. He was one of the founding members of the Indian National Congress party[1][2] and owned several designations as member of the Bombay legislative council, member of the finance committee[1] at the centre, and judge of the Bombay High Court, Maharashtra.[3]
As a well known public figure, his personality as a calm and patient optimist influenced his attitude towards dealings with Britain as well as reform in India.  During his life he helped to establish the Vaktruttvottejak Sabha, the [[Poona Sarvajanik Sabha]], Maharashtra Granthottejak Sabha, and the Prarthana Samaj, and edited a Bombay Anglo-Marathi daily paper, the Induprakash, founded on his ideology of social and religious reform.
