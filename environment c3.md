# biotic interaction
(1.04 pm)
these interactions can be negative or positive in nature.

			_concept map_
_+ve interaction			- ve interaction_
mutualism				   [[competition]]
	symbiosis		            [[predation]]
	proto-cooperation	    [[parasitism]]
[[commensalism]]			     [[amensalism]]
## positive interaction
- where 2 species benefit each other or 1 [[species]] is benefited & other is neutral. for ex symbiotic relation.
## negative interaction
- _related_ [[caste system]] [[yajmani 制度]] 
- when 2 [[species]] are harmed or 1 is harmed & other is benefited. for ex predation.
types of positive interaction are:
# ******************************
# positive interaction
## mutualism
- ++
- when both species benefit each other.
	- it's of 2 forms: [[symbiosis]] & proto-cooperation.
### symbiosis
- ++
- [[spiderman]] [[venom symbiote]]
- it's compulsory mutualism.
- both species must remain together all time to derive benefits.
- for ex [[coral reefs]] & [[zooxanthellae]] (marine algae).
- another ex is [[legume]] & [[rhizobium]].
### proto-cooperation
- ++
- like [[one night stand]]
- it's non-compulsory mutualism.
- 2 species came together for a while to derive benefit & separate after getting benefit.
- for ex hermit crab & sea anemones. [[stock moc]] [[trade 贸易]]
## commensalism
- +0
- [[commensalism]] _related_ [[amensalism]]
- 1 species is benefited & other is neutral.
- for ex:
	- barnacle & whale
		- [[barnacle]] (benefited) attached to body of [[whale]] (neutral).
	- suckerfish & shark
		- suckerfish (benefited) attached to body of [[shark]] (neutral).
# ******************************
# negative interaction
## competition
- --
- it's harmful to both species.[[competition]] [[game]] [[geopolitics]] [[george friedman]] [[indian civil services]] [[civil service]]
- it's of 2 from:
	- inter-specific: b/w 2 diff types of species. for ex, [[tiger]] & [[lion]].
	- intra-specific: b/w same type of species. for ex, 2 tigers competing for deer. _related_ [[alexander]] & his dad [[quotes#^36fc01]]
## predation
- +-
- it benefits 1 & harms another. _related_ [[caste system]]
- predator gets food (nutrition). _related_ [[pyramid of energy]] [[pyramid of numbers]] [[=48 laws of power]]
	- for ex lion & [[goat]].
## parasitism
- +-
- it's harmful to host & benefits parasite.
- ecto-parasites: that live on host. for ex lice, leach, mite, cuscuta(found on plant).
- endo-parasites: that live inside host. for ex worms, plasmodium, etc.
## amensalism
- -0
- [[amensalism]] _related_ [[commensalism]], 
- 1 gets harmed & other is unaffected.
- for ex, a small plant (harmed by getting restricted shade) growing under a big tree (neutral).
	- son of [[lorenzo]] (dad is successful (so 0), hence big tree's shade ^2d06dd
	- but son feels pressured to perform {so -ve} ), hence small tree cannot get enough [[sun]]light
# ******************************
# key terms related to species
(1.45 pm)
## 1 keystone species
- [[=how to hide empire#^c219fa]]
- they play a very important role in maintaining balance of ecosystem.
- they are very few in number but have a disproportionate impact on its ecosystem. _related_ [[pareto principle]] [[lorenz curve]]
- they are critical to food web of [[ecosystem]].
	- for ex [[tiger]], [[elephant]], [[dugong]], etc.
## 2 foundation species
 - _related_ [[frontier gandhi]] [[mars]] [[elon musk]] [[deep state]]
- they lay foundation of a new [[ecosystem]] or establish a new ecosystem. _related_ [[ecosystem productivity]]  [[tony stark#^fe3257]]
- they are more in number & dominate their [[ecosystem]].
- for ex:
	- [[lichen]] (symbiotic relation b/w [[algae]] & [[fungi]]) breaks down [[rock]] & helps in [[soil]] formation. [[geo 33 end of climatology#^21345f]] ^013e2f
	- corals help in formation of coral reef ecosystem. _related_ [[coral reefs]] [[coral bleaching]]
## 3 indicator species
- they indicated quality of [[_environment moc]] where they live.
- they act as early warning system.
- for ex:
	- lichens indicated presence of so2 gas(air pollution) as they are sensitive to so2, thus disappear in its presence.
	- [[coral bleaching]] indicated global warming & [[ocean]] acidification.
## 4 flagship species
- #doubt 
- like _flagship smartphones_ iphone 13 - ₹1lac 07:49 pm 09/10/2021
- they are prioritized for [[conservation]].
- they act as icons for environmental protection & awareness.
	- for ex bengal tiger (project tiger), asiatic lion, etc.
## 5 umbrella species
- #doubt wts diff b/w umbrella & fondation keystone species then ?
- they are large animals occupying large geographical areas as habitats.
- they are migratory in nature.
- protecting these species indirectly protects geographical area/habitat as well as other species found in habitat. related- _american intervention in vietnam was imp as it demonstrated a guarantee to its allies of american assurance_ _related_ [[vietnam]] [[united states of america]] [[russia]] [[cold war]] 
	- for ex elephants, tigers, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[orangutan]]s, whales, sea [[turtle]]s.
## 6 threatened species
- these are those species that are facing a high risk of [[extinction]].
- as per [[iucn]] red data book, 3 categories including critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable. _related_ [[status anxiety]] [[thucydides trap]] [[geopolitics]] #critically_endangered #vulnerable #threatened
- #todo find out all categories of [[iucn]]
	- for ex gharial, gypsy vulture, great indian bustard.
## 7 endemic species
- there are those species that are only found in a particular geographical [[area]].
- they are restricted to a particular geographical range & are localized.
- they are [[important]] for [[conservation]] of [[biodiversity]]. 
- endemism is linked to concept of biodiversity hotspots (large geographical areas with high endemic & threatened species). _related_ [[endemic]]
- for ex: #todo 
	- hoolock gibbon: only found in ne-india.
	- sangai-deer: only found in manipur.
	- nilgiri-tahr: only found in nilgiri part of western ghats.

# ******************************
# nutient cycles/bio-geochemcial cycles
(3.12 pm)
 - _related_ [[laws of nature]]   
- important elements like c, n, s, o, p get cycled in [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]], [[lithosphere]], [[hydrosphere]].
- they are mainly of 2 types:
## gaseous cycle
- reserve pools are atmosphere & [[ocean]]s.
- for ex-
	- carbon cycle,
	- nitrogen cycle,
	- oxygen cycle,
	- water cycle.
## sedimentary cycle
- reserve pool is [[earth]]'s [[crust]].
- returned to reserve pool through sedimentation process.
- for ex-
	- sulfur cycle,
	- phosphorus cycle, etc.
## carbon cycle
(3.22 pm)
- processes taking up carbon in form of co2(g) from atmosphere are:
- [[photosysnethis]]: 6co2+6h2o= c6h12o6 +6o2.
- [[diffusion]] & dissolution in [[ocean]]s:
- 1/3rd atmospheric co2 is absorbed by oceans.
- absorbed co2 gas gets converted into carbonic acid.
- carbonic acid reacts with salts to form carbonates & bicarbonate ions.
- this leads to acidification of oceans.
- dry ice: co2 gas is solidified into dry ice when mountain glaciers & polar ice are formed.
### sources of carbon
- process that releases carbon in form of co2 gas are:
- [[respiration]] by living organism.
- burning of [[fossil]] fuels like [[coal]], hydrocarbon by vehicle, power plants, etc.
- natural process like volcanic eruptions, forest fire, etc _related_ [[volcanic mountains]]
- decomposition of organic matter releases co2  & carbon in soil (buried inside earth).
- melting of glaciers & polar ice releases co2 locked in dry ice. _related_ [[ice 岁]]
## nitrogen cycle
(3.45 pm)
- n2 gas constitutes 78% of total gases in [[atmosphere]].
- #pneumonic _nf n as am dn_ like [[arabic]] plurals - walad - awlaad similarly --> nanad - _nnaad_
	- _meta pneumonic to learn above pneumonic ( #humor ) - nfn asaam dn_
### nitrogen fixation
- conversion of atmospheric [[nitrogen]] into nitrate.
- during lighting, nitrogen gets converted to no2 & mixes with water to come as acid rain.
- fixation by microorganisms: by symbiotic bacteria & fungi for ex azotobacter, rhizobium,  mycorrhiza, nostoc, anabaena, etc.
- haber's process: manufacturing of ammonia. this ammonia is used to make ammonium fertilizer used in agriculture _related_ [[habeau corpus]] [[chemistry]]
### nitrification
soil ammonia is 1st converted into nitrite & then to nitrate by soil bacteria.
### assimilation
plants take up nitrate from soil & convert it into biological material like amino-acid, protein, dna, rna, etc.
### ammonifaction
dead organic matter is broken down by bacteria to release protein into ammino-acid to ammonia.
### de-nitrification
free n2 gas is released into atmosphere by breaking down nitrate as soil by bacteria.
