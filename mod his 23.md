- led 被 [[bal gangadhar tilak]] 和 [[anie besant]]
- tilak setup indian home rule league HRL ([[1916]]) 和 then besant setup 都 印度 hrl (1916)
- goal 的 hrl
		- [[swaraj]] ie home rule within د [[british]] rule
		- tilak's demands / view-
			- 我们 是 loyal to د brits
			- goal 的 home rule
			- linguistic reorg 的 provinces
			- 过 反 untouchability, 要 its end, 他 说-"if god permits untouchability, then I reject such a god"

- background / reason 为 hrl 动
	- tilak on release 以后 六 年 里  [[alipur conspiracy case]] ([[1908]]) found د [[Indian National movement]] weak, [[aurobindo ghosh]] had moved to a spiritual life + [[lala lajpat rai]] went 外, 所以 tilak 要 revive [[polity]] activity
	- 但 د situation 是 -
		- [[extremists]] were 不 分 的 [[indian national congress]] post [[surat split]] ([[1907]]), 所以 tilak 要 re-entry 的 extr into د congress
		- [[world war 1]] 过 ongoing 和 brits had armed themselves 跟 draconian 法 like [[defence 的 印度 行为 1915]] , 所以 any 动 那 went directly 反 brits could be easily suppressed

- *∴ hrl 动 adopt the following methods-*
		- an educative propaganda to arouse feelings 的 [[nationalism]] + to educate masses about [[swaraj]] 和 民主
		- such a prog would neither offend د [[moderates]] nor د brits
		-  د goal 的 [[swaraj]] within british rule 过 里 line 跟 د goal 的 moderates post [[1892]] ie self-[[polity]]府 on lines 的 [[australia]] 和 [[Canada dd]]
		-  [[annie besant]] 变得 [[president]] 的 [[indian national congress]] 里 [[1917]] + she favored re-entry 的 د [[extremists]] into [[indian national congress]]
		-  [[1914]] inc session - [[indian national congress]] refused entry to extremists
		-  [[1919]] sess- decision to allow re-entry taken, 因为 [[PM mehta]] had died by د then
		-  [[1915]] sess - [[annie besant]] failed to convince moderates *that inc adopts 或 sanctions hrl 动,* ∴ 1916, besant 和 tilak setup HRLs 外面 [[indian national congress]]
		-  [[lucknow session]] [[1916]] inc sess - decision 的 [[1915]] session 是 implemented 和 tilak rejoins inc
# impact 的 hrl 动
- [[secular]] 里 nature as tilak 不 用 religion 为 moblilization 的 masses, 他 也 condemned untouchability
- 他 说- "brit need to 给 [[swaraj]] 不 because brits 是 [[christianity 🕇 ✠]] 但 br rule 不是 里 natl interest 的 印度 人"
	-  它 organizationally strengthened inc [[management]] [[efficiency]]
	-  popularized inc 中 د masses
	-  local congress committees were activated - 力
	-  re-entry 的 extremists into د inc made 它 更 力
	-  它 trained leaders 为 [[future]] gandhian struggle 比如 - [[jinnah]], [[jawaharlal nehru]] etc joined hrl
	-  ↑ed 统一 中 [[moderates]] 和 extremists- [[1917]], besant 过 arrested , this generated lotta anger 里 د 人 和 leadership, [[moderates]] 以后 joined hrl
	-  ↑ed participation 的 人 + +ce 的 inc 里 新 areas, 比如 - [[gujarat]], sindh, berar, [[bihar]], [[South India]]---> 大 新 areas joined [[Indian National movement]]
	-    它 contributed to [[montagu statement 1917]]
# -ves
-  它 tried 但 failed to 变得 a mass 动
		-  60,000 人 joined hrl
-  however, montagu statement 1917 played د role 的 dividing extr 和 moder again
-  1917 session - a passive resistance resolution 过 on agenda ie proposal to begin 第二 phase 的 hrl 动 , moderates opposed 和 besant got confused, proposal 过 不 passed, 这 disheartened د extremists 和 hrl 变 defunct
-  brits 也 repressed د hrl 里 [[1917]] ie followed policy 的 carrot 和 stick
-  [[1906]], budget speech 的 morley 为 ICA [[1909]] + 1917 MONTAGU STATEMENT (*carrot*)
-  1907 [[surat split]] onwards, brits suppressed extremists + brits suppressed hrl 里 1917 (*stick*)

# lucknow pact 1916
note- regular sess 的 [[indian national congress]] were always held 里 *december*, 和 special sess 里 *其他  月*
- what ? = 为 第一 时, joint demands 为 constitutional reforms 给 by [[indian national congress]] 和 [[muslim league]] [[1885]] 和 [[1906]]
- reason 为 anti-[[british]] attitude 的 [[muslim league]]-
		- annullment 的 [[partition]] 的 [[bengal]] 里 [[1911]][[mod his 21#^d00beb]]
		- brits refused demand 的 muslims to 给 力 universities 里 aligarh to affiliate college
		- *international [[events]]*
			- 1911 - [[libya]] 过 annexed 被 [[italy]] 和 [[britain]] 不 帮 [[libya]] which 过 分 的 [[Ottoman empire]], which was ruled by khalifa who 过 religious head 的 都 د muslim 世界
			- 1912-13- balkan wars, ottoman lost territory 里 balkan peninsula 和 british 不 帮
		- 1912, [[muslim league]] adopted د goal 的 self-政府 [[calcutta session]]

## provisions 的 [[lucknow pact]] 1916
- 这 pact 过 signed 中 [[indian national congress]] 和 [[muslim league]] 里 a sp joint session 的 inc 和 [[muslim league]] (ml), د inc 和 ml agreed to following demands to [[british]]-
	- separate electorates 为 muslims , (contributed to [[2 国 theory]])
		- 2 国 theory [[sir syed ahmed khan]]
				-  它 过不 about 2 nations 大a  about 2 provinces !!
				-  initially 要 兩 provinces 为 hindus 和 muslims 跟 a weak centre
	- [[expansion]] 的 councils 跟 elected majority  
		- (ICA 1861:- nomination, ICA 1892, selection (fake indir election) , IC 1909 - indirect election)
	- viceroy 的 exec counc (今天 的 council 的 ministers) to have half members as 印度 人  (ica 1909- 第一 印度 人)
	- univ adult franch
# [[goi 行为 1919]] (montagu-chelmsford reforms 也 叫 montford reforms)
- reasons 为 brits bringing 它 -
	- rising popularity 的 extremists 和↓popularity 的 moderates ∴ brits 要 to reward moderates ie د mild § 的 印度 national 动
	- brits 要 to prevent د demise 的 moderates
	- during anc era, 中 was [[zamindar]] 和 middle class , former were chosen, here 中 extremists 和 [[moderates]] 也 former were chosen [[patterns of history]] ICAI 1861, brits 要 to reward loyalist zamindars/landlords now they were into rewarding moderates [[balance of power]] [[george friedman#^e6302d]]
- hrl 动s had put pressure 为 home rule
- [[pressure]] 的 [[lucknow pact]] 1960 哪 brought muslim league 和 inc 一起 brits were on backfoot as their policy 的 divide 和 rule failed temporarily
- there was moral [[pressure]] 的 liberal §s 里 british polity, 因为  [[world war 1]] was fought 被 allied 力 supposedly   为 民主 和 self-determination [[atlantic charter]]
	- allied 力 = 民主 
	- central 力 = autocratic monarchies
# montagu statement 1917
(secretary 的 state)
- henceforth british policy 里 印度 would 有 an overall obj 的 gradually developing self-governing institutions, 跟 a view 为 progressive realization 的 responsible 政府 里 印度 as an integrap 部分 的 british 帝国
	-  gradually 所以 not immediate self 政府
	-  progressive 不 immeditate responsible 政府 (executive 能  be dismissed 被 legislative)
	-  integral 部分 意思 是 = 不 [[independence]] 独立
	-  since 现在 long term goal 的 british policy 过 self-政府 ∴ demand 的 swaraj 过 不 more illegal, seditious
# provisions 的 [[goi 行为 1919]]
- legislature-
	- [[bicameral legislature]] @ centre by creating central legislative assembly ie CLA + council 的 states + COUNCIL 的 STATES COS (ie ILC 的 ica 1861changed to CCA + COS) + 为 [[princely states]] a narendra mandal ie chamber 的 princes 过 生 ---> met د demand 的 princes 因为 they 要 更er assoc 跟 brit polic[[princely states|y 里 princely st]]ates ∴ 现在  princes 能 hope to exert [[pressure]] on brit wrt british policy / actions 里 princely states
- elections
	- 第一 时 direct elections 为 CLA 和 PLA/ PLC
	- right to vote 过 significantly expanded, yet 它 过 limited mainly to د richer § 的 society (upper middle class)
	- 女 为 د 第一 时 got د right to vote
- background
	- ICA 1909 had brought non-official 多数 但 不 elected 多数 里 PLCs
- 第一 时 elected 多数 里 兩 houses @ centre 和 里 PLAs (∴ [[goi 行为 1919]] met demand 或 lucknow pact 1916) 
- [[polity 09|reservation]] 和 separate electorates were further expanded 现在 sikh 和 depressed classes were 给 [[polity 10|reservation]] 和 separate electorates 里 都 د sense
- tenure - members 的 CLA were to 有 tenure 的 三年s, members 的 COS were to 有 tenure 的 五年s
- allocation  的 seats to provinces 里 CLA 和 COS WERE not as per 人口 的 province是 但 重要 ,比如 - commercial importance 的 [[bombay]], [[punjab]]- 因为 的 being a border province

- 力s 的 legislature
	- subjects were divided 中 centre 和 [[state]] however,  它 过 不 federal (ie original) distribution 的 力s 和 centre was  delegated legislative 和 adminisrative 力s wrt provincial subjects
	- provincial budgets were separated 为 第一 时 ie centre wont be making budget 为 provinces 和 they 能 draft own budget + sources 的 revenue were 也 divide 中 centre 和 provinces 比如- income tax 和 customs to centre + land [[rev]] to provinces (ie why IRS 是 [[central services]], while IAS = all india)
	- [[viceroy]] contd to 有 veto 力s 余 CLA, COS
	- viceroy could approve rejected bills 里 certain [[_cases moc]]
	- viceroy contd to be 不 resp to legislature
	- 他 contd to 有 ordinance 力
- budget as a 全 was still non-votable (75% 的 items 里 budget could not be voted on)
- viceroy 能 restore cuts 里 grants (ie if legislative has ↓ funds asked 为 by exec then viceroy can overrule the legislature)
- 为 第一 时 legislature could pass adjournment motion

- central executive
	- central public service commission 过 setup (upsc 帝国)
	- simultaneous exam 为 ICS 里 印度
	- viceroy exec to 有 三 印度 人 (ICA 1909)
	- salary 的 sec 的 state 会 be 给 by britain 和 不 印度
	- subjects were divided 中 centre 和 states 为 purposes 的 administration (like 为 admin)
	 
# [[goi 行为 1919]] brought [[dyarchy]] 里 provinces
- 二 kinds 的 ministers/ministries

| 1     |2      |      |      |      |
| ---  | ---  | ---  | ---  | ---  |
|those who were rep to PLA     |those who werent      |      |      |      |
|these ministeries were manned by elected/popular members |these will be under bureaucrats      |      |      |      |
|ie there were to be 二 kinda subj at prov level, 有 transferred subj (politically 少  imp, educaiton, health) 和 reserv subj (finance, law 和 order|      |      |      |      |

-  PLA could make 法 only on د transferred subjects, while reserved subj were to be legislated upon by bureaucrats
-   د elected minister would struggle 跟 shortage 的 funds ∴ would 变得 unpopular
- PLAs -
	- unlike CLA, COS, د pla could reject د budget 但 governor could restore 它
	- through governor, [[viceroy]] had full control 余 reserved subj, this hurt provincial autonomy (goi 1935 行为 that brought provincial autonomy)
	- some bills 被 PLA were to be reserved 为 assent 的 viceroy (我们 [[宪法 constitution]] 今天 has this feature)
	- some bills needed prior sanction 的 viceroy even before their introduction 里 PLA
	- [[viceroy]] 里 cert circumstances 能 legislate on provincial subjects 因为  它 过 not federal distri 和 centre had merely delegated legislative authority to provinces
	- gov had ordinance making 力 , veto 力 , 能 approve rejected bills if deemed 重要
	- 里 case 的 failure 的 [[宪法 constitution]] machinery, governor rule can be implemented ie gov could take 余 legislative 和 行政 (admin) func 的 transferred subj
	- gov could overrule council 的 ministers (which administers transferred subj) on any matter
- result-
	-  它 failed to satisfy د [[Indian National movement]] leaders, 因为-
		-  no universal adult fran
		-  [[dyarchy]]
		-  unsatisfactory allocation to subj
		-  不 resp [[polity]]府
		-  seats 里 CLA, COS to provinces not as per 人口
