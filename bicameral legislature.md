the [[government of india act 1919]] introduced bicameralism in [[india]].
it is practice of having two houses of [[parliament]].
bicameralism is not a new concept, *it was adopted by us constitution* in [[1787]] for very first time.
at state level, equivalent of
	[[lok sabha]] = vidhan sabha (legislative assembly)
	[[rajya sabha]] = vidhan parishad (legislative council)
a so-called upper house is considered important in parliamentary system, as only a third of seats are filled every two years & it, therefore, acts as a check against potential impetuousness of electoral majorities in lower house.
bicameralism acts as a check over potential abuse of power by executive or government with [[majority]].
