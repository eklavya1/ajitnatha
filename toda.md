toda people are a *dravidian* ethnic group who live in nilgiri mountains of indian state of [[tamil nadu]]. before [[18th century]] & british colonisation, toda coexisted locally with other ethnic communities, including kota, badaga & kurumba, in a loose caste-like society, in which toda were top ranking. during [[20th century]], toda population has hovered in range 700 to 900. although an insignificant fraction of large population of india, since early 19th century toda have attracted "a most disproportionate amount of attention because of their ethnological aberrancy" & "their unlikeness to their neighbours in appearance, manners, & customs".[3] study of their culture by anthropologists & linguists proved significant in developing fields of social anthropology & ethnomusicology.
