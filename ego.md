Humans must learn to put off id desires or channel them into socially harmless or useful actions. In order to accomplish this, the child must incorporate the standards of its culture into the developing personality. In this process, the id feelings are tamed and do not appear. Thus the child acquires ego. The ego is the integrated personality that results when id feelings are properly channelized and under the control of cultural forces.
