Science Was initially nurtured through exchanges of ideas that moved like merchandise between distant places over the ancient trade routes. Two, Dyson considered evidence-based modern science as an intellectual rebellion or as a form of dissent against so- cial constraints, as exemplified by the Islamic and the European re- naissance of science of the Middle Ages, or the reawakening in India that around the 19th century that formed the background for the independence struggle.
