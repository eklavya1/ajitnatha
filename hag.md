- A **hag** is a wizened old woman, or a kind of fairy or goddess having the appearance of such a woman, often found in folklore and children's tales such as "Hansel and Gretel". Hags are often seen as [[malevolent]], but may also be one of the chosen forms of shapeshifting deities, such as The Morr√≠gan or Badb, who are seen as neither wholly benevolent nor malevolent.
