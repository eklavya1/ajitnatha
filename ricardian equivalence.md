**in the face of high deficits, people save more.**
It plays an important role in *macroeconomic theory*.
The RET suggests that fiscal stimuli which are defined in terms of deficit-financed public spending hikes or tax cuts will lead to a crowding out of private consumption, thereby
decreasing the effectiveness of fiscal policy in boosting economic activity.
It states that *consumers are forward-looking* and will base their spending not only on their current income but also on their expected future income.
They will understand that borrowing today means higher taxes in the future.
Further, the consumer will be concerned about future generations because they are the children and grandchildren of the present generation and the family which is the
relevant decision-making unit, continues living.
They would increase savings now, which will fully offset the increased government dissaving so that national savings do not change.
This view is called Ricardian equivalence after one of the greatest nineteenth-century economists, David Ricardo, who first argued that in the face of high deficits, people save
more.
It is called 'equivalence' because it argues that taxation and borrowing are equivalent means of financing expenditure. When the government increases spending by
borrowing today, which will be repaid by taxes in the future, it will have the same impact on the economy as an increase in government expenditure that is financed by a tax increase today.

- [ ] Ricardian equivalence is an economic theory that says that financing government spending out of current taxes or [[future]] taxes (and current deficits) will have equivalent effects on the overall economy. 
- [ ] This means that attempts to stimulate an economy by increasing debt-financed government spending will not be effective because investors and consumers understand that the debt will eventually have to be paid for in the form of [[future]] taxes #meta . The theory argues that people will save based on their expectation of increased [[future]] taxes to be levied in order to pay off the debt, and that this will offset the increase in aggregate demand from the increased government spending. This also implies that Keynesian fiscal policy will generally be ineffective at boosting economic output and growth.
- [ ] This theory was developed by [[david ricardo]] in the early [[19th century]] and later was elaborated upon by Harvard professor [[Robert Barro]]. For this reason, Ricardian equivalence is also known as **the Barro-Ricardo equivalence proposition**.
