- **Manchuria** is an [[exonym]] for a historical and geographic region of Russia and China in Northeast Asia (mostly in Northeast China today). Its extent may vary depending on the context:

- Modern geographical region:
- (most often) Northeast China, specifically the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning, but broadly also including the eastern Inner Mongolian prefectures of Hulunbuir, Hinggan, Tongliao, and Chifeng, and sometimes Xilin Gol;

- Greater Manchuria, the region of Northeast Asia that served as the historical homeland of the Jurchens and later their descendants Manchus, which was controlled in whole by China before the Amur Annexation in 1860. The region was since then divided between China (Northeast China, also known as "Inner Manchuria") and Russia (the Amur drainage basin that located south of the Uda River and Stanovoy Range, which is now comprised the southern part of the Russian Far East. Also known as "Russian Manchuria", "Outer Northeast" or "Outer Manchuria");

- Historical polities usually referred to as Manchuria:

- The Later Jin (1616–1636), the Manchu-led dynasty which was the predecessor to the Qing dynasty, or the subsequent duration of the Qing Dynasty prior to its conquest of China proper (1644);

- the northeastern provinces of the Qing dynasty, the homeland of Manchus, known as  "Guandong" or "Guanwai" during the Qing dynasty;

- Manchukuo (1932–1945), a puppet state of Imperial Japan. Its occupied territories included the entire Northeast China, the northern fringes of present-day Hebei Province, and the eastern part of Inner Mongolia.First used in the 17th century by the Japanese, it remains a common term elsewhere but is deprecated within China due to its association with Japanese imperialism and Manchu chauvinism. Instead, the term Northeast Region (东北; Dōngběi) is used in official state documents to describe the region. Northeast China is predominantly Han Chinese due to internal Chinese migrations and Sinicization of the Manchus especially during the Qing Dynasty. It is considered the homeland of several minority groups besides the Manchus, including the Yemaek the Xianbei, the Shiwei, and the Khitans. The area is also home to many Mongols and Hui.Manchuria is often referred to as the "Chinese rust belt", due to the shrinking cities that used to be the center of China's heavy industry and natural resource mining, but today face increasing economic decline.
