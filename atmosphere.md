## atmospheric pressure
weight of a column of air contained in a unit area from mean sea level to top of atmosphere is c/a atmospheric pressure.
measured in force per unit area.
expressed in 'millibar' or mb unit.
at application level, atmospheric pressure is stated in kilo-pascals.
measured by aneroid barometer or mercury barometer.
in lower atmosphere, pressure declines rapidly with height.
vertical pressure gradient force is much larger than that of horizontal pressure gradient & is commonly balanced by almost equal but opposite gravitational force.
low-pressure system is encircled by 1 or more isobars with lowest pressure at center.
high-pressure system is also encircled by 1 or more isobars with highest pressure in center.
isobars are lines connecting places having equal pressure.
