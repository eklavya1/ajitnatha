- l法院 里 [[Indira Sawhney & others Vs Union of India case]]
	- "To conclude, though prima facie list of Backward Classes which is under attack before us may be considered to be on basis of caste, a closer examination will clearly show that it's only a description of group foll particular occupations or professions, exhaustively referred to by [[Commission]]. Even on assumption that list is based exclusively on caste, it's clear from materials before Commission & reasons given by it in its report that entire caste is socially & educationally backward & therefore their inclusion in list of Backward Classes is warranted by Article 15(4). groups mentioned therein have been included in list of Backward classes as they satisfy various tests, which have been laid down by this Court for ascertaining social & educational backwardness of a class,"
