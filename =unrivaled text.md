 I am deeply grateful to many people for making this book possible. Chief 
among them are six outstanding mentors that guided my path from student to professor. Ryan Mills, Melissa Wade, and Carrie Rosefsky Wickham 
taught me how to teach and inspired me to become an educator. Richard 
Betts, Andrew Nathan, and Robert Jervis supervised my Ph.D. dissertation 
and shaped how I think about international relations. 
 I would not have been able to write a book like this if I did not work at 
two wonderful institutions, Tufts University and Harvard’s Kennedy 
School of Government, where scholars are encouraged to study big questions and not to worry too much about traditional academic boundaries. I 
would particularly like to thank Kelly Greenhill, Richard Eichenberg, Natalie Masuoka, Nimah Mazaheri, Steven Miller, Malik Mufti, Dennis Rasmussen, Elizabeth Remick, Tony Smith, Jeffrey Taliaferro, and Stephen Walt for 
their support. 
 I owe tremendous thanks to the faculty at Dartmouth’s Dickey Center for 
International Understanding, my academic home away from home, where 
I received help at every stage of writing this book, from developing the 
ideas to tracking down the data to writing the proposal. I am especially 
grateful to Stephen Brooks, Jeffrey Friedman, Jennifer Lind, Daryl Press, 
Benjamin Valentino, and William Wohlforth for expert feedback. 
 Over the years, many friends have had a hand in this project. Stefano 
Recchia not only studied with me, but also had the (dis)pleasure of living 
with me for most of graduate school. He has been like an older brother, 
showing me the ropes in academia and how to live a balanced life. Mike 
Horowitz has helped me in countless ways, from research to writing to negotiating the academic job market. I will never be able to return the favor,

but I hope to pass it on. Jonathan Markowitz has spent hours brainstorming 
with me, reading my work, and imposing much-needed rigor on my research. His infl uence is everywhere in this book, but most prominent in 
 chapter 2 . Nuno Monteiro and Paul MacDonald offered trenchant comments on the second version of the manuscript. Their shrewd criticism 
prodded me to write a completely revamped, third version of the book—a 
grueling task that was well worth the effort. 
 The Smith Richardson Foundation provided generous fi nancial support 
for my research and helped put me through graduate school. For that, I am 
eternally grateful. I thank my editor at Cornell University Press, Roger 
Haydon, along with the series editors and anonymous referee for giving 
the book a voice. The beautiful map in chapter 4 was produced by Noah 
Rose, Thomas Lucic, and Shaan Shaikh. A portion of that chapter was previously published as “The Emerging Military Balance in East Asia: How 
China’s Neighbors Can Check Chinese Naval Expansion,” International Security 42, no. 2 (fall 2017). I am indebted to the editors of International Security for allowing me to use that material here. 
 My grandparents did not live to see this book, but as members of the 
Greatest Generation they helped inspire it. Laverne and John Beckley answered the call of duty in World War II and were beloved members of their 
community throughout their lives. Lillian and Tom Iwata were imprisoned 
in Japanese-American internment camps while their brothers served in the 
442nd Regimental Combat Team, the most decorated military unit of its 
size and length of service in American history. One of those brothers, Robert Mizukami, received a Purple Heart. Another, William Mizukami, made 
the ultimate sacrifi ce. As I wrote this book, I thought often about their service to a great nation at a dark time in its history. 
 Diane Beckley and Jennifer Brouwer are two of my role models. They 
climbed the corporate ladder at a time when women were almost totally 
shut out of the boardroom. Now they serve as pillars of their community, 
shaping local government, donating to charity, and spreading love and joy 
to neighbors. As a frequent recipient of that love, joy, and charity—and as 
the father of a daughter—I send them my deepest thanks. 
 Throughout the years of research and writing, my wife, Silvana, has been 
my best friend and sharpest critic, providing incisive feedback, unwavering support, good humor, and timely kicks in the rear. She scrutinized every word of this book, except for this paragraph, and her wise judgment 
vastly improved the fi nal product. More important, her love and laughter 
lifted my spirits and made me whole. This book would not exist without 
her, and my life would not be nearly as fulfi lling. 
 My greatest thanks go to my parents, Barbara and Dennis, who have devoted more love and encouragement to me than I can possibly express, let 
alone repay. Their support for my education alone was monumental. They 
sacrifi ced their material comfort to send me to college, and they took it

upon themselves to educate me throughout my childhood. My Mom raised 
me to appreciate good writing by reading to me almost every night. My 
Dad taught me how to do proper research by walking me through my fi rst 
study, a third-grade science project that proved that baking soda and vinegar can turn a wine bottle into a cannon. Together my parents have fi lled my 
life with many happy memories and valuable lessons that I draw on every 
day. The older I get, the more grateful I become, and the more I realize that 
Mom and Dad were right about just about everything. I dedicate this book 
to them.

 chapter 1 
 Why America? 
	 By most measures, the United States is a mediocre country. It ranks seventh 
in literacy, eleventh in infrastructure, twenty-eighth in government effi -
ciency, and fi fty-seventh in primary education. 1
 It spends more on healthcare than any other country, but ranks forty-third in life expectancy, 
fi fty-sixth in infant mortality, and fi rst in opioid abuse. 2
 More than a hundred countries have lower levels of income inequality than the United States, 
and twelve countries enjoy higher levels of gross national happiness. 3
 
 Yet in terms of wealth and military capabilities—the pillars of global 
power—the United States is in a league of its own. With only 5 percent of 
the world’s population, the United States accounts for 25 percent of global 
wealth, 35 percent of world innovation, and 40 percent of global military 
spending. 4
 It is home to nearly 600 of the world’s 2,000 most profi table 
companies and 50 of the top 100 universities. 5
 And it is the only country 
that can fi ght major wars beyond its home region and strike targets anywhere on earth within an hour, with 587 bases scattered across 42 countries 
and a navy and air force stronger than that of the next ten nations combined. 6
 According to Yale historian Paul Kennedy, “Nothing has ever 
existed like this disparity of power; nothing.” The United States is, quite 
simply, “the greatest superpower ever.” 7
 Why is the United States so dominant? And how long will this imbalance 
of power last? In the following pages, I argue that the United States will 
remain the world’s sole superpower for many decades, and probably 
throughout this century. We are not living in a transitional post–Cold War 
era. Instead, we are in the midst of what could be called the unipolar era—a 
period as profound as any epoch in modern history. 
 This conclusion challenges the conventional wisdom among pundits, 
policymakers, and the public. 8
 Since the end of the Cold War, scholars have 
dismissed unipolarity as a fl eeting “moment” that would soon be swept 
away by the rise of new powers. 9
 Bookstores feature bestsellers such as The 
Post-American World and Easternization: Asia’s Rise and America’s Decline ; 10
the U.S. National Intelligence Council has issued multiple reports advising 
CHAPTER 1
2
the president to prepare the country for multipolarity by 2030; 11 and the 
“rise of China” has been the most read-about news story of the twenty-fi rst 
century. 12 These writings, in turn, have shaped public opinion: polls show 
that most people in most countries think that China is overtaking the 
United States as the world’s leading power. 13
 How can all of these people be wrong? I argue that the current literature 
suffers from two shortcomings that distort peoples’ perceptions of the balance of power. 
 First, the literature mismeasures power. Most studies size up countries 
using gross indicators of economic and military resources, such as gross 
domestic product (GDP) and military spending. 14 These indicators tally 
countries’ resources without deducting the costs countries pay to police, 
protect, and provide services for their people. As a result, standard indicators exaggerate the wealth and military power of poor, populous countries 
like China and India—these countries produce vast output and fi eld large 
armies, but they also bear massive welfare and security burdens that drain 
their resources. 
 To account for these costs, I measure power in net rather than gross terms. 
In essence, I create a balance sheet for each country: assets go on one side of 
the ledger, liabilities go on the other, and net resources are calculated by 
subtracting the latter from the former. When this is done, it becomes clear 
that America’s economic and military lead over other countries is much 
larger than typically assumed—and the trends are mostly in its favor. 
 Second, many projections of U.S. power are based on fl awed notions 
about why great powers rise and fall. Much of the literature assumes that 
great powers have predictable life spans and that the more powerful a 
country becomes the more it suffers from crippling ailments that doom it to 
decline. 15 The Habsburg, French, and British empires all collapsed. It is 
therefore natural to assume that the American empire is also destined for 
the dustbin of history. 
 I argue, however, that the laws of history do not apply today. The United 
States is not like other great powers. Rather, it enjoys a unique set of geographic, demographic, and institutional advantages that translate into a 
commanding geopolitical position. The United States does not rank fi rst in 
all sources of national strength, but it scores highly across the board, 
whereas all of its potential rivals suffer from critical weaknesses. The 
United States thus has the best prospects of any nation to amass wealth and 
military power in the decades ahead. 
 For the foreseeable future, therefore, no country is likely to acquire the 
means to challenge the United States for global primacy. This is an extraordinary development, because the world has been plagued by great power 
rivalry for millennia. In the past fi ve hundred years alone, there have been 
sixteen hegemonic rivalries between a ruling power and a rising power, 
and twelve of them ended in catastrophic wars. 16 In the fi rst half of the 
WHY AMERICA?
3
twentieth century, for example, when the world was multipolar, Germany 
twice challenged Britain for European primacy. The result was two world 
wars. In the second half of the twentieth century, under bipolarity, the 
Soviet Union challenged the United States for global primacy. The result 
was the Cold War, a confl ict in which the superpowers spent between 6 and 
25 percent of their GDPs on defense every year, waged proxy wars that 
killed millions of people, and brought the world to the brink of nuclear 
Armageddon. 
 Today, by contrast, unipolarity makes a comparable level of great power 
competition impossible and thus makes a comparable level of confl ict 
highly unlikely. 17
 Not the Argument 
 Before elaborating on the points above, let me be clear about what I am not
arguing. First, I am not arguing that U.S. dominance is guaranteed or will 
last forever. The United States could easily squander its geopolitical potential. It could, for example, gut its demographic advantage by restricting 
high-skill immigration. It could allow demagogues and special interests to 
capture its political institutions and run the country into the ground. Or it 
could fritter away its resources on reckless adventures abroad. In addition, 
there are any number of events (e.g., a nuclear accident, natural disaster, or 
disease outbreak) that could disproportionately devastate the United States. 
The purpose of this book is not to argue that unipolarity is set in stone, but 
rather to make an educated guess about how long it will last based on present trends and current knowledge about why great powers rise and fall. 
 Second, I am not arguing that the United States is invincible or all-powerful. There are more than 190 countries, 7 billion people, and 197 million 
square miles of territory on earth. The United States cannot be present, let 
alone dominant, in every corner of the globe. Weaker nations can “route 
around” American power, doing business and calling the shots in their 
home regions while ignoring the United States. 18 They also can “tame” 
American power by, among other things, denying the United States access 
to their domestic markets, suing the United States in international courts, 
bribing American politicians, bankrolling anti-American terrorist groups, 
hacking U.S. computer networks, meddling in U.S. elections, or brandishing 
weapons of mass destruction. 19 Unipolarity is not omnipotence; it simply 
means that the United States has more than twice the wealth and military 
capabilities of any other nation. To translate those resources into infl uence, 
the United States will often have to collaborate with regional players. 
 Third, I am not arguing that unipolarity constitutes a Pax Americana, in 
which U.S. primacy guarantees global peace and prosperity. Unipolarity 
implies the absence of one major source of confl ict—hegemonic rivalry—but 
CHAPTER 1
4
it allows for, and may even encourage, various forms of asymmetric confl ict 
and domestic decay. 20 The United States still faces serious threats at home 
and abroad. The purpose of this book is to clarify the scope of these threats, 
not to deny their existence. 
 Finally, I am not arguing that Americans are inherently superior to other 
nations or that the United States is the most wonderful place on earth. I 
assume that people are basically the same all around the world, and I know 
for a fact that citizens of some rich nations enjoy a higher quality of life than 
the average American. My argument, therefore, is not that Americans are 
exceptional or that the United States is the greatest country in the world. 
Instead, I argue that the United States has been blessed by exceptional circumstances that all but guarantee that it will be the most powerful nation. 
One implication of this conclusion, as I explain later, is that the United 
States can afford to devote a bit more of its immense resources to improving 
the lives of its citizens. 
 Plan of the Book 
 The plan of the book is straightforward. First, I develop a framework for 
measuring power and use it to assess current trends in the balance of 
power. Then, I build a framework for predicting power trends and use it to 
assess the future prospects of today’s great powers. Finally, I discuss the 
implications of my fi ndings for world politics and U.S. policy. 
 the pillars of power 
 Chapter 2 defi nes power and explains how to measure it. I start by showing that standard indicators exaggerate the power of populous countries 
because they ignore three types of costs that drain countries’ economic and 
military resources: production, welfare, and security costs. 
 Production costs are the price of doing business; they include the raw 
materials consumed, and the negative externalities (e.g., pollution) created, 
during the production of wealth and military capabilities. Welfare costs are 
subsistence costs; they are the expenses a nation pays to keep its people 
from dying in the streets and include outlays on basic items like food, 
healthcare, education, and social security. Finally, security costs are the 
price a government pays to police and protect its citizens. 
 Needless to say, these costs add up. In fact, for most of human history, they 
consumed virtually all of the resources in every nation. Even today, they tie 
down large chunks of the world’s economic and military assets. 21 Thus analysts must deduct these costs to accurately assess the balance of power. 
 To illustrate these points, I show that the rise and fall of the great powers 
and the outcomes of hundreds of international wars and disputes during 
WHY AMERICA?
5
the past two hundred years correlate closely with variations in countries’ 
net stocks of economic and military resources—not with gross fl ows of 
resources. China and Russia, for example, had the largest GDPs and military budgets in the world during much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but both countries suffered from severe production, welfare, 
and security costs that condemned them to defeat at the hands of smaller 
but more effi cient nations. 
 After reviewing this history, I develop a framework for assessing the current balance of power. I also explain why China is the most potent challenger to U.S. primacy and thus why I focus on the U.S.-China power 
balance in the following two chapters. 
 economic trends 
 Chapter 3 analyzes economic trends for the United States and China. The 
main conclusion is that the United States is several times wealthier than 
China, and the absolute gap is growing by trillions of dollars each year. 
China’s economy is big but ineffi cient. It produces high output at high 
costs. Chinese businesses suffer from chronically high production costs, 
and China’s 1.4 billion people generate massive welfare and security burdens. The United States, by contrast, is big and effi cient, producing high 
output at relatively low costs. American workers and businesses are seven 
times more productive than China’s on average, and with four times fewer 
people than China, the United States has much lower welfare and security 
costs. Gross domestic product and other popular indicators create the false 
impression that China is overtaking the United States economically. In reality, China’s economy is barely keeping pace as the burden of propping up 
loss-making companies and feeding, policing, protecting, and cleaning up 
after one-fi fth of humanity erodes China’s stocks of wealth. 
 military trends 
 Chapter 4 analyzes the U.S.-China military balance, both overall and 
within East Asia. The results are stark: the United States has fi ve to ten times 
the military capabilities of China, depending on the type of military forces in 
question, and maintains a formidable containment barrier against Chinese 
expansion in East Asia. In a war, China could potentially deny the U.S. military sea and air control within a few hundred miles of China’s territory, but 
China cannot sustain major combat operations beyond that zone, and the 
United States retains low-cost means of denying China sea and air control 
throughout the East and South China seas as well as preventing China from 
accomplishing more specifi c objectives, such as conquering Taiwan. 
 The widespread perception that China is poised to dominate East Asia 
and close the military gap with the United States stems from a neglect of 
CHAPTER 1
6
production, welfare, and security costs. My analysis takes these factors into 
account. I show, for example, that Chinese weapons systems are roughly 
half as capable as the United States’ on average; Chinese troops, pilots, and 
sailors receive less than half the training of their American counterparts 
and have limited operational experience and no combat experience; China’s personnel costs are at least 25 percent higher than the United States’; 
and homeland security operations consume at least 35 percent of China’s 
military budget and bog down half of China’s active-duty force, whereas 
the U.S. military outsources such operations and their costs to civilian 
agencies. 
 Of course, U.S. military assets are dispersed around the world whereas 
China’s are concentrated in East Asia. The United States, however, is 
involved in most regions by choice and can redeploy forces from one area 
to another without seriously jeopardizing its security. China, by contrast, 
has to keep most of its military on guard at home, because it suffers from 
twice the level of domestic unrest as the United States and shares sea or 
land borders with nineteen countries, fi ve of which fought wars against 
China within the last century and ten of which still claim parts of Chinese 
territory as their own. Crucially, many of these countries have developed 
the means to deny China sea and air control throughout most of its near 
seas—even without U.S. assistance. 
 In sum, despite much talk of the rise of China, the United States maintains a huge economic and military lead, and the trends are generally in its 
favor. For China or any other nation to catch up to the United States, they 
will need to grow their power base much faster than they currently are. 
How likely is that? 
 future prospects 
 Chapter 5 analyzes the future prospects of the great powers and shows 
that the United States has the best foundation for growth. 
 I begin by critiquing two theories that currently dominate discussions 
about why great powers rise and fall—balance-of-power theory and convergence theory. Both of these theories suggest that unipolarity will be 
short lived. 22 Balance-of-power theory holds that weak states usually gang 
up on strong states and force a redistribution of international power. 23 Convergence theory holds that poor countries grow faster than rich countries, 
thus rising challengers inevitably overtake reigning hegemons. 24
 I argue that these theories do not apply today. Balance-of-power dynamics are muted, because the United States is too powerful and far away for 
other major powers to balance against. 25 Currently, no country can afford 
a sustained military challenge to U.S. primacy, and all of America’s potential rivals are packed together in Eurasia and therefore are more likely to 
fi ght each other than band together against the distant United States. 26 To 
WHY AMERICA?
7
back up this argument, I show that balancing against the United States 
has been sporadic since 1991 while bandwagoning with the United States 
has been widespread. 
 Convergence theory, on the other hand, is underspecifi ed. 27 Sometimes 
poor countries grow faster than rich countries and sometimes they fall further behind. In the late nineteenth century, for example, Germany, Japan, 
and the United States rose relative to Britain whereas Austria-Hungary, 
France, Russia, China, India, and the Ottoman Empire declined. These and 
other historical examples show that convergence is conditional; it depends 
on additional factors that, so far, have not been incorporated into theories 
of international change. 
 To address this shortcoming, I develop a new framework for projecting 
the rise and fall of nations. Drawing on studies from the fi eld of economics, 
I show that sustained economic growth depends on three broad factors: 
geography, institutions, and demography. 
 The ideal geography for growth is one with abundant natural resources, 
transport infrastructure, and buffers from enemies. 28 The ideal government 
is one that is capable yet accountable, meaning that it is strong enough to 
provide services and maintain order, but suffi ciently divided to prevent 
corruption and the violation of private property rights. 29 Finally, the ideal 
population is large, young, and educated. 30
 After presenting the evidence linking these factors to economic growth, I 
use indicators of each to assess the future prospects of the eight most powerful countries: the United States, China, Russia, Japan, Germany, the 
United Kingdom, France, and India. 
 I fi nd that the United States has, by far, the best growth fundamentals. 
Geographically, the United States is a natural economic hub and military 
fortress. It has enormous stocks of natural resources, more natural transport 
infrastructure than the rest of the world combined, and is surrounded by 
“friends and fi sh” (Canada, Mexico, and two huge oceans) whereas all the 
other major powers border powerful rivals. Institutionally, the United States 
is so-so. The small and divided U.S. government does a poor job redistributing wealth, but it fosters entrepreneurship and innovation; spurs reform 
after policy blunders; and helps the United States suck up investment, technology, and human capital from other nations. Demographically, the United 
States has the most productive population, and its working-age population 
is set to grow during this century, unlike the populations of its competitors. 
 Potential challengers each have several weaknesses. China, the only 
country that is anywhere close to challenging U.S. primacy, has especially 
dismal growth prospects. In the coming decades, China will lose a third of 
its workforce and age faster than any society in history, with the ratio of 
workers to retirees shrinking from 8-to-1 today to 2-to-1 by 2050; its institutions fuel corruption, stifl e entrepreneurship, and stymie reform after 
policy mistakes; its natural resources have dwindled due to overuse 
CHAPTER 1
8
and pollution; and it is encircled by more than a dozen hostile countries. 
Russia has vast stocks of natural resources, but its institutions are more corrupt and less effective than China’s, and it has a declining and extremely 
unhealthy population and a vulnerable geographic location. Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom have slightly more effective and less corrupt institutions than the United States (France lags slightly behind), but 
they have small and shrinking populations and few natural resources. India 
will soon have the largest and youngest population among the great powers, but it trails the other great powers in virtually every other category. 
 In sum, the United States has the most potential for future growth, in 
addition to an enormous economic and military lead. Unipolarity is not 
guaranteed to endure, but present trends strongly suggest that it will last 
for many decades. 
 implications 
 Chapter 6 concludes by discussing the implications of unipolarity for 
world politics and U.S. policy. The most important implication is the absence 
of hegemonic rivalry. During the past fi ve hundred years, there has been a 
hegemonic competition between a rising power and a ruling power every 
thirty years on average. 31 Seventy-fi ve percent of these feuds ended in war, 
and even many of the “peaceful” cases were vicious cold wars. Today, by 
contrast, the United States does not face a peer competitor. As a result, there 
is less warfare in the world than in any period in modern history. 32 
 Unipolarity, however, is not totally conducive to peace and prosperity. In 
the remainder of chapter 6 , I highlight several dangers. 
 First, unipolarity may undermine crisis stability between the United 
States and weaker nations. 33 American military superiority could embolden 
the United States to stand fi rm in a crisis while simultaneously encouraging 
weaker nations to shoot fi rst, before the U.S. military can wipe out their 
offensive forces. This “use it or lose it” dynamic can turn minor incidents 
into major wars. I discuss how the United States can avoid such scenarios 
with China, Russia, and North Korea. 
 Second, unipolarity will tempt the United States to fi ght stupid wars of 
choice in areas of little strategic value. 34 I explain where and when such 
imperial temptations will be most severe and propose ways to contain them. 
 Third, without a superpower rival, American national unity may dissolve, and special interests may capture the country’s institutions and stifl e 
reform and innovation. 35 The analyses of U.S. institutions in chapter 5 suggest that polarization, gridlock, and corruption are already infecting the 
American system of government. I highlight these trends and assess various proposals to reverse them. 
 Finally, unipolarity could undermine the liberal world order. 36 As the 
world’s sole superpower, the United States is more capable than other

nations of providing global governance, but it may have less incentive to 
do so given its secure location and vast stocks of wealth. In the coming 
decades the United States could become a “global power without global 
interests,” turning inward while leaving others to maintain international 
security, prop up the global economy, and defend human rights. 37 Arms 
buildups, insecure sea-lanes, and closed markets are only the most obvious 
risks of a return to U.S. isolationism. 38 Less obvious are problems, such as 
climate change, water scarcity, refugee crises, and disease, which may fester 
without a leader to rally collective action. I discuss these threats to global 
security and explain why the United States can and should help address 
them.

 chapter 2 
 The Pillars of Power 
 The balance of power is the motor of world politics, playing a role as central 
as the role of energy in physics and money in economics. 1
 Power, however, 
is like love; it is “easier to experience than to defi ne or measure.” 2
 Just as a 
person might have trouble saying “I love you 3.6 times more than her,” 
scholars have trouble quantifying power, because there are many ways to 
conceptualize it. 3
 In this chapter, I defi ne power, develop a framework for 
measuring it, and show that this framework does a better job than existing 
approaches at tracking the rise and fall of great powers and predicting the 
outcomes of international disputes and wars. 
 Conceptual Issues 
 resources versus outcomes 
 Power can be measured in two main ways. 4
 The most common approach, 
and the one I adopt in this book, measures power by tallying the wealth and 
military assets of each country. The logic of this “power as resources” approach 
is simple. Wealth enables a country to buy many forms of infl uence through 
aid, loans, investment, and bribes and to cultivate soft power by, among other 
things, funding global propaganda campaigns, building awesome skyscrapers, and hosting international expos. 5
 Military resources (e.g., troops and 
weapons), on the other hand, enable a country to destroy enemies, attract 
allies, and run extortion rackets, extracting concessions and favors from 
weaker countries through threats of violence and offers of protection. 6
 
 Some scholars, however, defi ne power in terms of outcomes. 7
 Power, 
they argue, is fi rst and foremost about winning. It is the ability of a country 
to prevail in a dispute, attract followers, and set the agenda of international 
negotiations. 8
 Measuring power, these scholars argue, therefore requires a 
“power as outcomes” approach that involves observing international 
events—such as wars or diplomatic negotiations—and then determining 
THE PILLARS OF POWER
11
the extent to which the participants shaped the outcomes in line with their 
respective interests. 
 Both defi nitions of power have virtues. The power as outcomes approach 
usefully tells us who got what, when, and how on a specifi c issue. It also 
helps explain cases in which the side with fewer resources prevailed. Such 
David versus Goliath cases are not uncommon; in fact, they account for 
roughly 25 percent of all international disputes and wars. 9
 Materially weak 
countries can defeat better-endowed opponents through smart strategy, or 
dumb luck, or by running more risks or bearing greater costs. 10 By defi ning 
power in terms of outcomes, analysts can account for these nonmaterial 
factors and measure power with a greater degree of granularity than the 
power as resources approach. 
 Yet the power as outcomes approach has several weaknesses that limit its 
usefulness for what I hope to accomplish in this book. First, I want to assess 
the overall balance of power—that is, the balance of power across a broad 
range of issues—but the power as outcomes approach is inherently issue 
specifi c. The reason is that evaluating outcomes requires knowing the preferences of the actors involved; in other words, fi guring out which country 
won a dispute (the outcome) requires fi rst establishing what each country 
wanted to happen in the fi rst place (preferences). Preferences, however, are 
not fi xed—different countries, at different times, want different things—so 
while we might know a country’s preferred outcome regarding a particular 
event, it is diffi cult, if not impossible, to know the preferences of many 
countries across hundreds of events over long periods of time. Thus the 
great strength of the power as outcomes approach—its specifi city—becomes 
a weakness when the goal is to assess the overall balance of power. 
 A second limitation of the power as outcomes approach is that it is only 
useful for analyzing past events. After all, analysts must wait for an outcome to occur before they can study it. In this book, however, I want to 
make an educated guess about the balance of power in the decades ahead. 
To do that, I need a measure of power that can be projected into the future. 
 Third, the power as outcomes approach sometimes leads to nonsensical 
conclusions. For example, North Vietnam defeated the United States in the 
Vietnam War (1965–73), but it would be strange to argue that North Vietnam, 
a fl edgling country where most of the population was living on less than a 
dollar per day, was more powerful than the United States, a globally engaged 
superpower with a $3 trillion economy, dozens of allies, and thousands of 
nuclear weapons. A better interpretation of the war’s outcome would be that 
power has limits, and that North Vietnam defeated the United States, not 
because it was more powerful, but because it was more resolved (i.e., more 
willing to suffer and bear costs in pursuit of its objectives). In short, power 
alone does not determine outcomes; grit, luck, and wisdom matter too. The 
power as resources approach usefully untangles power from these other elements whereas the power as outcomes approach lumps them together. 
CHAPTER 2
12
 For these reasons, I ultimately adopt the power as resources approach. I 
do so, however, using a hybrid model: I measure power in terms of 
resources, but I use data on outcomes to evaluate the relative validity of different resource indicators. Specifi cally, I determine which indicators of 
resources most accurately track the rise and fall of the great powers and 
predict the winners of international disputes and wars. This dual approach 
captures the best of both worlds; it yields a measure of power that is both 
historically valid and generalizable, one that faithfully refl ects the past but 
also can be applied to the present and projected into the future. 
 gross versus net 
 Power resources can be measured in gross or net terms. Most standard 
indicators, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and military spending, 
are gross indicators, meaning that they do not deduct costs. Such indicators 
overstate the power of populous countries, because they count the benefi ts 
of having a big population—namely, the ability to mobilize a large workforce and raise a big army—but not the costs of having many people to 
feed, police, protect, and serve. 
 A big population is obviously an important power asset. 11 Luxembourg, for 
example, will never be a great power, because its workforce is a blip in world 
markets and its army is smaller than Cleveland’s police department. A big population, however, is no guarantee of great power status, because people both 
produce and consume resources. One billion peasants will produce immense 
output, but they also will consume most of that output on the spot, leaving few 
resources left over to buy global infl uence or build a powerful military. 
 To rank among the most powerful nations in the world, a state needs to 
amass a large stock of resources, and to do that a state must be populous 
and prosperous. It must produce high output at low costs. It must not only 
mobilize vast inputs, but also produce signifi cant output per unit of input . In 
short, a nation’s power stems, not from its gross resources, but from its net 
resources—the stock of resources left over after subtracting costs. 12
 What costs? There are three main types that erode countries’ power 
resources: production, welfare, and security costs. Production costs are the 
price a nation pays to generate wealth and military capabilities. They 
include the raw materials consumed, and the negative externalities (e.g., 
pollution) spewed out, during the production process. Welfare costs are 
subsistence costs; they are the expenses a nation pays to keep its people 
alive and include outlays on basic items like food, healthcare, education, 
and social security. Finally, security costs are the price a government pays 
to police and protect its citizens. 
 These costs tie down large chunks of every country’s assets. To accurately 
assess the balance of power, therefore, analysts must deduct them by using 
net indicators. 
THE PILLARS OF POWER
13
 stocks versus flows 
 Resources can be measured as stocks or fl ows. Stocks refer to accumulated 
resources; they are a nation’s stash, or stockpile, of wealth and military assets. 
Flows, on the other hand, measure annual increases and decreases (i.e., 
infl ows and outfl ows) of resources. Stocks and fl ows each tell us something 
important about a country. Stocks tell us about a country’s total resources at a 
given moment in time. Flows, by contrast, tell us about a country’s trajectory; 
that is, whether its resources are increasing or decreasing, and by how much. 
 In the long run, say over many decades, stocks and fl ows will point in the 
same direction; a country that enjoys sustained net infl ows of resources will 
eventually accumulate large stocks. Over shorter periods of time, however, 
stocks and fl ows can point in opposite directions. For example, a country 
could experience a net outfl ow of resources for several years, but still retain 
huge stocks of wealth and military assets, just as a family of aristocrats with 
a large estate can blow through millions of dollars and still be fabulously 
wealthy. Conversely, a country experiencing a short-term infl ux of resources 
may, nevertheless, have meager stocks, just as a young sports star from a 
poor family can earn a high salary but still have little wealth in the bank. 
 In sum, fl ows provide a glimpse of a country’s recent performance, but 
not a sense of a country’s total wealth and military assets. For that reason, I 
measure the balance of power in terms of net stocks of resources and use 
fl ow measures only to gauge trends in the balance of power. 
 Indicators 
 Enough said about conceptual issues. More needs to be said about how, exactly, 
to measure power, which means discussing specifi c indicators. In the next three 
subsections, I show that the most commonly used indicators of wealth, military 
capabilities, and overall power ignore costs and stocks. After highlighting this 
problem, I explain how analysts can fi x it by using net stock indicators. 
 wealth indicators 
 The most commonly used measure of aggregate wealth is GDP, which 
records the value of all goods and services produced within a country over 
a fi xed period of time. GDP has been described as “the leading indicator” 
and “the Zeus of the statistical pantheon” because governments, organizations, and analysts around the world use it to gauge states’ relative economic standing. 13 As Zachary Karabel explains: 
 No single number has become more central to society in the past fi fty years. 
Throughout the world, GDP has become a proxy for success and for failure, 
CHAPTER 2
14
for sentiment about the future and sense of well-being in the present. It has 
the power to win or lose elections, overthrow governments, start popular 
movements. . . . Public debates about the economy in every country in the 
world today are framed by whether GDP is growing or contracting and by 
how much. It is a convenient reference point for news and for politicians. 
After all, it’s one number, rarely more than three digits, and almost anyone 
can grasp that if that number goes up, it’s good, and if it goes down, it’s 
bad. As goes GDP, so goes the nation, whether that nation is the United 
States or China. 14 
 Despite the widespread use of GDP, however, few people know what it 
actually measures. In particular, it is rarely recognized that GDP measures 
gross fl ows of resources and therefore does not deduct costs or measure 
long-term wealth accumulation. 
 For example, GDP counts production costs (inputs and externalities) as 
output. Spending money always increases GDP, even if the funds are 
wasted on boondoggles. In fact, the most common method of calculating 
GDP is called the “expenditure method” and involves simply adding up all 
of the spending done by the government, consumers, and businesses in a 
country in a given time period. 15 Thus hiring workers always increases 
GDP, even if they spend all day getting drunk in the break room. Boosting 
production always increases GDP, even if the goods rot on the shelf and 
tons of toxic waste are produced in the process. In fact, a country can 
increase its GDP by dumping toxic waste in the streets and then hiring millions of workers and spending billions of dollars to clean it up. 
 GDP also does not deduct welfare costs. Money spent feeding people is 
counted the same as money earned selling supercomputers on world 
markets. Consequently, populous countries generate considerable economic activity simply by existing. Even a nation caught in a Malthusian 
hell, in which all output is immediately devoured and living standards 
and technological progress are stagnant, will post a large GDP if it has a 
big population. 
 In addition, GDP counts many security costs as economic output. GDP 
does not distinguish between guns and butter; a $100 million gulag shows 
up the same as a $100 million innovation center. Hence, GDP fails to account 
fully for the economic costs of confl ict. In fact, GDP usually rises when a 
country mobilizes for war. To be sure, defense spending can sometimes 
yield economic dividends—for example, the Internet and GPS began as 
U.S. military research projects—but in general, resources devoted to policing and protection drain wealth rather than create it. 16
 How can analysts address these shortcomings of GDP? The ideal solution would be to deduct costs and measure net stocks of resources directly. 
For example, if a country cuts down a forest to build a new offi ce park, then 
the value of the forest would show up as a loss on the country’s balance 
THE PILLARS OF POWER
15
sheet. If a country spends $50 billion fi ghting a war—or growing food to 
feed its people or cleaning up toxic waste or hosting the Olympics—then 
$50 billion would be deducted from its stock of assets. In short, there would 
be no free lunch. 
 The obvious drawback to such an approach, however, is that compiling 
balance sheets for every country is a painstaking process that requires substantial data and time. Fortunately, the World Bank and the United Nations 
(UN)—working with dozens of economists from leading universities and 
research organizations—have taken up the task and published databases 
that measures countries’ wealth stocks from the 1990s to the present in 
three areas: produced capital (man-made items such as machinery, buildings, infrastructure, software); human capital (the population’s education, 
skills, and working life span); and natural capital (water, energy resources, 
arable land). 17
 These databases are still being refi ned, but they provide a rough fi rst look 
at national stocks of wealth. 18 In chapter 3 , therefore, I begin my analysis of 
economic trends by presenting data from each database on countries’ stocks 
of produced, human, and natural capital. I then provide a more detailed 
analysis by presenting data on the subcomponents of each type of capital. 
For example, I supplement the produced capital indicators with measures 
of productivity, innovation, and debt; I supplement the human capital indicators with information on the education, health, and organization of each 
country’s population; and I supplement the natural capital indicators with 
data on each country’s reserves of natural resources and rates of depletion. 
This layered analysis grafts “qualitative fl esh onto quantitative bones,” 
combining the rigor and mathematical precision of a quantitative index 
with the granularity of detailed case research. 19
 military indicators 
 Most analysts measure military power with gross “bean counts” of military spending, troops, and weapons. Journalists, for example, usually focus 
on military spending. 20 Academics typically use the Composite Indicator of 
National Capability (CINC), which is an index that combines military 
spending with data on troops, population, and industrial output. 21 Similarly, governments usually size up foreign rivals in terms of military expenditures and head-to-head force comparisons. 22 In the U.S. Department of 
Defense, for example, analysts use force densities, attrition coeffi cients, and 
fi repower scores—all of which are basically measures of gross manpower 
or fi repower. 
 Like GDP, these standard military metrics do not deduct production, welfare, or security costs. In military affairs, production costs refer to the  number of assets needed to produce a given level of force and are mainly a function of skill, technology, and distance; a military with skillful personnel 
CHAPTER 2
16
and superior technology operating from nearby bases will use fewer 
resources to accomplish a mission than a military with low skill and outdated technology fighting far from home. Crude counts of military assets 
gloss over these factors and sometimes yield wildly inaccurate estimates of 
the military balance as a result. 
 For example, in 1990, U.S. defense planners, using numerical force comparisons, predicted that the United States would suffer between 2,500 and 
48,000 casualties if it invaded Iraq, which had the fourth largest military in 
the world at the time. 23 In 1991, however, a U.S.-led coalition, operating 
from secure bases near the combat theater, decimated Iraq’s army and 
killed 35,000 Iraqi troops while losing only 240 attackers. Subsequent 
research showed that this lopsided outcome stemmed from the United 
States’ superior skill and technology, factors that standard metrics largely 
missed. 24
 Standard military indicators also ignore welfare costs. A country’s military budget is tallied the same regardless of how much is spent on food, 
housing, uniforms, medical care, pay, and pensions for the troops. These 
personnel costs, however, are not trivial; in many countries, they account 
for one-third of the military budget and can balloon to 50 percent or more 
for large armies, especially after wars. 25 Countries that can limit these costs, 
and concentrate funds on weapons, literally get more bang for the buck. 
 Finally, standard military indicators do not deduct security costs, which 
refer to military assets used for internal security and border defense missions. Military units that are bogged down quelling rebellions or defending 
borders against foreign invasions cannot project power abroad. Deducting 
security costs thus accounts for the fact that two nations with identical militaries may, nevertheless, wield vastly different levels of military power if 
one country is surrounded by enemies and wracked by domestic instability 
whereas the other is stable and surrounded by allies. 
 How can analysts incorporate these costs into military assessments? 
Unfortunately, there are no databases of net military stocks currently available. In chapter 4 , therefore, I manually account for production, welfare, 
and security costs by comparing the relative skill and technology of each 
nation’s military units; deducting the resources each nation devotes to welfare and homeland security; and conducting operational analyses of the 
most likely scenarios for war involving the United States and China, the 
main challenger to U.S. primacy. 
 overall power indicators 
 As the discussion above makes clear, measuring net stocks of resources is 
a tedious process that requires substantial data and time. Policymakers and 
scholars, however, sometimes want a single “headline” indicator that provides a parsimonious estimate of the overall balance of power and for 
THE PILLARS OF POWER
17
which data are available for many countries stretching back many years. 
Several such indicators are widely used by scholars, policy analysts, and 
journalists. Unfortunately, all of them measure gross fl ows of resources 
rather than net stocks. 
 The most popular headline indicator is GDP. Proponents of GDP argue 
that it serves as a solid proxy for overall power because it represents a 
country’s raw productive potential. 26 Although GDP is technically an economic indicator, proponents argue that it captures both economic and military capacity, because states can easily convert economic resources into 
military might. In short, GDP is fungible; it can be turned into “any mix of 
military, economic, and political” resources, just as a person can use cash to 
buy many forms of infl uence. 27
 After GDP, the most popular headline indicators of power are indexes of 
“war potential.” Some of these indexes simply tally each nation’s military 
spending, number of troops, or both. Others combine military spending and 
troops with gross economic output and population size. 28 For example, the 
U.S. National Intelligence Council, a body that advises the president on longterm security threats, measures power with an indicator that combines military spending, R&D spending, GDP, and population. The logic of combining 
these factors is that power ultimately depends on the ability to win major wars, 
and doing that requires a big army backed by substantial industrial might. 
 Among scholars, the most commonly used indicator of war potential is 
the CINC index mentioned earlier, which combines military spending, 
troops, population, urban population, iron and steel production, and 
energy consumption. 29 Data from CINC are available for most countries 
from 1816 to 2010 and have been used in more than a thousand peerreviewed studies, including seminal studies on the causes of war, alliance 
politics, international cooperation, trade, nuclear proliferation, and 
democratization. 30
 Despite its widespread use, however, CINC suffers from the same problem as GDP: it is a gross measure that does not deduct costs. CINC, for 
example, counts military units the same regardless of their level of skill or 
technology, the costs of supporting those units, or the number of wars they 
have to fi ght. CINC also treats military spending and energy consumption 
(inputs) as if they were outputs. Thus a country can increase its CINC score 
by making enemies and then raising a huge, oil-guzzling army to attack 
them. Ultimately, CINC, like GDP, is a one-dimensional indicator; it only 
measures the gross size of a country’s resources, not how effi ciently a country uses its resources. 
 In sum, what is needed is a single indicator that can account for both size 
and effi ciency and for which there are data covering many countries over 
many years. Does such an indicator exist? 
 In an oft-cited statistical reference, the historian Paul Bairoch suggested 
that the “strength of a nation could be found in a formula combining per 
CHAPTER 2
18
capita and total GDP.” 31 Bairoch did not elaborate on this point, but subsequent research suggests that he was on to something: as noted, scholars 
already believe that GDP represents the gross size of a state’s economic and 
military resources, and there is a large body of literature showing that GDP 
per capita serves as a reliable proxy for economic and military effi ciency. 
 Economists, for example, use GDP per capita to measure economic development, because rich countries are, almost by defi nition, more effi cient and 
innovative than poor countries (the main exceptions to this rule are petrostates, like Saudi Arabia, that can grow rich simply by pulling oil out of the 
ground). Military studies also show that the higher a country’s GDP per 
capita, the more effi ciently its military fi ghts in battle. 32 The reason is that a 
vibrant civilian economy helps a country produce advanced weapons, train 
skillful military personnel, and manage complex military systems. 
 GDP per capita therefore provides a rough but reliable measure of economic and military effi ciency. This fi nding is not surprising, because population size is the main driver of production, welfare, and security costs—the 
bigger a country’s population, the more people the government has to protect 
and provide for—so dividing GDP by population effectively controls for 
many of the costs that make the difference between a state’s gross and net 
resources. Combining GDP with GDP per capita therefore yields an indicator 
that accounts for size and effi ciency, the two main dimensions of net resources. 
 To create a rough proxy for net resources, therefore, I follow Bairoch’s 
advice by simply multiplying GDP by GDP per capita, creating an index 
that gives equal weight to a nation’s gross output and its output per person. 
This two-variable index obviously does not measure net stocks of resources 
directly, nor does it resolve all of the shortcomings of GDP and CINC. But 
by penalizing population, it provides a better sense of a nation’s net 
resources than GDP, CINC, or other gross indicators. 
 Future studies can experiment with ways to improve this measure by 
adjusting the weights or, even better, by expanding the databases produced 
by the World Bank and UN or developing new measures of net stocks of 
resources. For now, however, multiplying GDP by GDP per capita yields a 
primitive proxy that can be used to demonstrate the importance of net 
resources in international politics. The next section does just that. 
 The Historical Record 
 research design 
 A brief look at the history of world politics over the past two centuries 
supports my claim that power is a function of net stocks of resources. To 
illustrate this point, I conduct case studies of extended great power rivalries in which one nation had a preponderance of gross resources whereas 
THE PILLARS OF POWER
19
the other had a preponderance of net resources. I focus on “extended” 
rivalries, meaning geopolitical competitions that lasted for several decades 
or longer, because they provide more information about each nation’s relative power than does a single war or crisis. I focus on great powers, because 
minor power competitions are often shaped by great power politics and 
thus may not reveal much information about the relative power of the 
minor powers themselves. And I focus on cases in which one side had a 
preponderance of gross resources while the other side had a preponderance 
of net resources, because these cases constitute head-to-head tests of the 
importance of gross versus net resources in geopolitical competition. 
 According to widely used datasets, there have been fourteen great power 
rivalries since 1816 that lasted at least twenty-fi ve years. 33 From this list, I 
select the rivalries with the largest gaps between the balance of gross and net 
resources. I measure gross resources as the average of one nation’s share of 
the sum of the two sides’ GDPs and CINC scores; and I measure net resources 
by calculating that same nation’s share of the sum of the two sides’ GDP x 
GDP per capita. In doing so, I am effectively using GDP and CINC as representatives for the standard, gross approach to measuring power; and using 
GDP x GDP per capita as the representative for my alternative, net approach. 
I calculate the gap between the balance of gross and net resources for each 
year of the rivalry by subtracting the latter from the former and taking the 
absolute value of the difference. I then calculate the average gap for each 
rivalry. These averages are displayed in descending order in table 2.1 . 
 To keep this chapter at a reasonable length, I do not analyze every rivalry 
but instead focus on the rivalries with the largest gaps, which I arbitrarily 
defi ne as those with at least a 20 percentage-point difference between the 
average balance of gross resources and the average balance of net resources. 
Six cases meet this criterion, however I ultimately exclude two of them—
France vs. China (1860–1929) and Britain vs. the Soviet Union (1946–1992)—
because these rivalries were sideshows in larger geopolitical competitions 
and thus do not constitute independent cases: in the nineteenth century, 
France challenged China only after Britain had already brought China to its 
knees in the Opium Wars; and during the Cold War, Britain’s rivalry with 
the Soviet Union was shaped by the larger U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Excluding 
these two cases leaves me with four cases for further study, which are highlighted in bold in table 2.1 . 
 Before analyzing these cases, it is worth noting that the nine cases with the 
largest gaps between the balance of gross and net resources, including the 
four cases I study below, involve China or Russia. This is not surprising 
because China and Russia are the only countries in the past two hundred 
years to have led the world in gross resources while lagging behind other 
great powers in net resources. Their experience in competitions with less populous but more developed countries thus provides the most straightforward 
test of my contention that power stems from net rather than gross resources. 
CHAPTER 2

 britain versus china, 1839-1911 
 By standard gross indicators, China looked like a superpower in the 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It had the largest GDP and military in the world until the 1890s, and the second largest GDP and military 
until the 1930s. 34 During this time, however, China suffered a “century of 
humiliation” in which it lost huge chunks of territory and most of its sovereign rights, fi ghting at least a dozen wars on its home soil and losing every 
single one of them. 
 Among these confl icts were two “opium wars” with Britain. 35 For centuries, European merchants had traveled to China to swap silver for tea and 
silk. In the nineteenth century, however, British traders discovered that 
they could make more money by growing opium in India and selling it on 
the black market in China. 36 Despite China’s long-standing ban on opium, 
British dealers smuggled into China nearly twelve tons of opium per year, 
enough to keep 3 million addicts high year round. 37 To pay for this infl ux of 
narcotics, Chinese citizens spent 400 tons of silver annually, a ruinous sum 
that eroded 20 percent of China’s wealth from 1828 to 1836. 38
 To stem the opium epidemic, the Chinese government declared a war on 
drugs in 1839. Chinese offi cials began seizing opium from British merchants

and dumping it into the sea. Britain responded by sailing sixteen warships 
into Chinese waters and sinking China’s navy. From 1839 to 1842, in what is 
now called the First Opium War, British forces occupied most of China’s 
major coastal cities and brought Beijing to the brink of famine by blockading 
the Grand Canal, the critical lifeline linking the Chinese capital to China’s 
main rice fi elds in the south. 
 Overmatched, the Chinese government capitulated in 1842 and signed 
the Treaty of Nanjing, which gave Britain $21 million in reparations, a perpetual lease on Hong Kong, access to fi ve port cities, unprecedentedly low 
Chinese tariffs, and immunity from Chinese law for British citizens living 
in China. 
 Fifteen years later, Britain upped the ante by demanding full economic 
access to all of China and the right to sell opium legally throughout the 
country. When the Chinese government resisted, Britain again used military force, sparking what is now known as the Second Opium War. In January 1858, British forces occupied Guangzhou, the largest port in China, and 
in April 1858 British forces, joined by French troops and Russian and American diplomats, occupied Tianjin, the commercial hub of northern China 
only 100 miles from Beijing. 
 China mustered little resistance to the invasion, in part because China’s 
military was busy suppressing the Taiping Rebellion, the bloodiest internal 
uprising in human history (estimated 20 to 30 million dead). In June 1858, 
therefore, the Chinese government signed the Treaty of Tianjin, granting 
Britain and its allies access to ten new treaty ports, freedom of travel 
throughout China, freedom of navigation on the Yangtze River, reparation 
of 6 million silver taels, and the legal right to sell opium in China. 
 When the Chinese government dragged its feet honoring these terms, 
British and French forces marched on Beijing, burned down the emperor’s 
Summer Palace, and forced the Chinese government to sign a new treaty—
the Treaty of Beijing—that quadrupled China’s reparations bill, added 
Tianjin to the list of open treaty ports, and incorporated the Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutter’s Island into Britain’s colony at Hong Kong. Over 
the next fi fty years, China would be forced to sign a dozen more “unequal 
treaties” with Britain, France, Russia, the United States, Germany, and 
Japan. 
 Clearly Britain was more powerful than China during the nineteenth 
century. This fact, however, is not captured by standard gross metrics: China’s GDP and defense budget were more than twice the size of Britain’s, 
and China’s army of 800,000 troops dwarfed the 7,000-troop force that Britain sent to China to fi ght the Opium Wars. 39
 China’s weakness is only apparent when costs are taken into account. 
 Figure 2.1 provides a fi rst-cut assessment and hints at what more detailed 
research makes clear: China suffered from greater production, welfare, and 
security costs than Britain and thus had fewer resources to draw on in their

is measured by my proxy for net resources (GDP x GDP per capita), Britain 
never overtook China in terms of GDP, and CINC suggests, nonsensically, 
that China and Britain were equally matched in the mid-nineteenth century 
and that China surpassed Britain in power in 1907, fi ve years before the 
Chinese government collapsed. 
 What were these costs? First, China was far less productive than Britain. 
The average unskilled worker in London generated three to six times the 
output of the average laborer in Beijing, and each British industrial worker 
generated sixteen to thirty-three times the output of each Chinese industrial worker. 40 British workers were not only healthier and better educated 
than Chinese workers on average, they also had superior technology. British looms, for example, could produce twenty times the output of a Chinese 
hand worker, and British power-driven “mules” (spinning machines) had 
two hundred times the capacity of Chinese spinning wheels. 41
 Second, China’s massive population, which was thirteen times larger 
than Britain’s, generated substantial welfare costs. China’s “welfare 
ratio” (its economic output divided by the costs of providing its population with food, clothing, and shelter) was stuck at “bare bones subsistence” levels throughout the nineteenth century, except during the 
Taiping Rebellion in the 1850s when the ratio dipped below subsistence 
and millions of people starved to death. 42 In Britain, by contrast, economic production was four times subsistence levels in 1820 and more 
than ten times subsistence by 1900. 43 
 Third, China’s sprawling territory generated severe security costs. The 
Chinese government faced twenty-fi ve major uprisings each year on average, so the central government had to keep taxes low to appease local rulers 
while simultaneously keeping military spending high to maintain large

internal security forces. 44 These competing demands plunged China into 
fi scal crisis. China’s tax revenues in the nineteenth century were 50 percent 
lower than they were in the seventeenth century and were fi ve times smaller 
than Britain’s in aggregate and a hundred times smaller on a per capita 
basis. 45 Meanwhile, China’s military spending consumed 50 to 70 percent 
of government revenues in peacetime and 100 percent or more during 
wars. 46 The fact that China lost all of its wars in the nineteenth century compounded these fi scal problems, because China had to pay the victors massive indemnities that typically exceeded the annual revenues of the Chinese 
government. 47
 Production, welfare, and security costs also drained China’s military 
resources. China’s military was unskilled and underequipped compared to 
Britain’s. As one study concludes: “In all areas of equipment—weaponry, 
forts, and most critically ships—Chinese equipment lagged behind that of 
the British . . . the British had long moved into the era of fi repower, while 
parts of the Chinese army hung on to bows, swords, spears, and rattan 
shields.” 48
 The best Chinese fi rearm was the matchlock, a muzzle-loading musket 
developed in the fi fteenth century that required soldiers to light a match 
each time it was fi red; British regiments, by contrast, were equipped with 
fl intlocks or breech-loading percussion locks. Chinese warships carried ten 
cannons each whereas British ships had 120 or more, and Chinese cannons 
lacked sights and swivels and thus could not target moving objects, like 
British ships and soldiers. Hopelessly outgunned, some Chinese defenders 
tied fi recrackers to monkeys and planned to hurl the weaponized animals 
onto British ships. 49 British fi repower, however, was so lethal that Chinese 
troops never got close enough to make the throw. 
 Without a viable offensive option, Chinese defenders mostly huddled in 
their forts, allowing the British to pick when and where to fi ght. Repeatedly 
during the Opium Wars, therefore, Chinese armies of thousands were 
routed in minutes by a few hundred, or even a few dozen, British troops. 
 Security costs also degraded China’s military power. China’s forces were 
“scattered through the empire, far too busy with domestic peace-keeping 
duties (killing bandits or rebels; carrying out disaster relief; guarding prisons; policing smugglers) to be spared for the quarrel with the British.” 50 At 
any given time, 50,000 Chinese soldiers were in transit around the country 
suppressing revolts. Consequently, Chinese garrisons typically had only a 
quarter of their troops on hand to counter British assaults. When the British 
attacked Tianjin in 1840, for example, only 600 of the registered 2,400 Chinese soldiers arrived in time for the battle. 51
 Britain, of course, had to fi ght far from home, but it had a series of secure 
bases in Asia that allowed it to project power around China’s periphery, 
thus nullifying China’s home-fi eld advantage. 52 The lethal combination of 
naval supremacy and secure forward-operating sites enabled Britain to 
CHAPTER 2
24
seize the initiative in numerous battles. For example, during the First 
Opium War, it took the British fl eet thirty-fi ve days to mass near China and 
capture Zhoushan, an island strategically located between Shanghai and 
Ningbo. Overstretched Chinese ground forces, by contrast, took fi ve 
months to rally a counteroffensive, which ultimately failed. 53
 japan versus china, 1874–1945 
 China’s misery did not end with the Opium Wars. In the latter half of the 
nineteenth century, Japan became determined not to suffer the same fate as 
China, so it revamped its government, economy, and military and began 
seizing territory and resources in East Asia. When China tried to stand in 
the way of Japan’s imperialist plans, Japan went on a rampage, quickly 
defeating China militarily in 1894 and forcing it to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the Liaodong Peninsula, Formosa (present-day 
Taiwan), and the Pescadores to Japan. China also was forced to recognize 
Korea’s independence—which effectively meant that Korea would become 
a vassal of Japan, no longer of China—and to give Japan commercial rights 
in China and pay a massive indemnity. 54
 After pocketing these gains, Japan annexed Korea in 1910, and when 
World War I broke out in 1914, Japan entered the war on the Allies’ side and 
seized the German-controlled city of Qingdao on China’s Shandong Peninsula. Japan then presented China with the infamous “Twenty-One Demands” 
that basically called for China to become a Japanese ward. The United States 
forced Japan to abandon its most punishing demands, but Japan still extracted 
substantial territorial and economic concessions from China. 
 A little over a decade later, Japan expanded its presence in northeast 
China, establishing a colony there called Manchukuo in 1932, and bringing 
the Chinese provinces of Jehol and Hebei under Japanese control in 1933. In 
1934, the Japanese government declared that East Asia was Japan’s sphere 
of infl uence and warned other great powers not to defend China. Then in 
1937, Japan staged a full-scale invasion. By the time World War II began in 
Europe in 1939, Japan controlled most of eastern China plus Taiwan and its 
outlying islands. Japanese expansion stopped only when it ran afoul of the 
United States, which decisively defeated Japan in 1945. 
 Obviously Japan was more powerful than China during their rivalry. Yet by 
standard metrics, China appeared to have far greater power resources ( fi gure 2.2 ). China’s population, GDP, and military were several times larger than 
Japan’s, but Japan had greater net resources because it was much more effi -
cient than China, with lower production, welfare, and security costs. 
 For starters, Japanese industry was more productive than China’s. In 1913, 
Japan’s labor productivity was three times greater than China’s overall, and 
by 1930, Japan was producing 150 times as much iron and steel as China and 
controlled 80 percent of the global silk market, China’s top export industry. 55
THE PILLARS OF POWER
25
 Welfare costs also worked in Japan’s favor. While Chinese economic output hovered around subsistence levels in the early twentieth century, 
Japan’s economy grew fi ve times faster than its population, “making it possible to feed the increasing number of Japanese born every year with 
enough left over to fi nance both the government’s modernization efforts 
and investment in the modern sectors of the economy.” 56 Whereas agriculture tied down 80 percent of China’s workforce and accounted for 65 percent of China’s GDP in the 1930s, it occupied only 47 percent of Japan’s 
workforce and made up 15 percent of its economy. 57
 Security costs took a smaller toll on Japan’s economy than China’s. Military spending consumed half of China’s government revenues in the fi rst 
three decades of the twentieth century, and if indemnities are included, 
then China’s security spending totaled 85 to 100 percent of government 
revenues. 58 In Japan, by contrast, the government allocated only 7 to 11 percent of its funds to the military, and this spending was more than offset by 
the wealth Japan seized from China. 59 For example, the indemnity Japan 
received after the Sino-Japanese war in 1895 equaled one-third of Japan’s 
GDP that year and paid for the expansion of Japan’s army, navy, railways, 
telephone lines, and iron industry. 60
 In military affairs, it was a similar story. 61 As one study concludes: “Chinese forces lost every major confrontation on the battlefi eld . . . and were 
inferior in organization, equipment, training, and leadership to the Japanese 
Army.” 62 China had one rifl e for every three soldiers and one artillery piece 
for every six thousand soldiers, and 80 percent of Chinese hand grenades 
failed to explode. 63 Japanese soldiers, by contrast, not only had modern fi rearms, but also tanks, armored vehicles, combat aircraft, and chemical weapons, which they used indiscriminately on Chinese troops and civilians. 
 Only 27 percent of Chinese offi cers received any formal training, 64 and 
few Chinese units had fi eld doctors, so even minor wounds often resulted

in death. 65 The Chinese military also lacked modern communication and 
transport equipment—according to one government report, there were 
only six thousand motorized vehicles in the entire country, and half were 
inoperable—so messages were sent via runners, and soldiers moved around 
the country on foot. 66 As a result, Chinese forces had a limited combat 
radius, a situation that made counterattacks and timely reinforcement 
nearly impossible. 
 Chinese military power also was undermined by welfare costs. As one 
study concludes: 
 The typical Chinese military unit spent the bulk of its time and energy simply trying to preserve its existence. It expected to have to take care of its 
own needs, including food, clothing, conscripts, weapons, and transportation. Fighting consumed too much energy, so fi ghting was done only when 
absolutely necessary. When suffi ciently desperate, soldiers would not hesitate to pillage the very same people they were supposed to protect. This in 
turn provoked numerous incidents of friction between the army and the 
civilian population. Probably the worst case occurred in Honan during the 
early phase of Operation Ichigo. When the Chinese troops retreated in 
defeat, more soldiers were killed by the indignant local population than by 
the Japanese. 67
 Finally, Chinese forces suffered substantial security costs because China 
was internally divided prior to the Japanese invasion; indeed, the period 
from 1916 to 1928 is called the “Warlord Era” because China was chopped 
up among rival military cliques. The Nationalist Party, led by Chiang KaiShek, took control of China in 1928, but its rule was contested by warlords, 
Muslims, and communists. During the war with the Japanese, therefore, 
the Chinese government had to station troops throughout the country to 
prevent domestic rivals from seizing power or seceding. 68 With its forces 
dispersed, the Chinese military often found itself outnumbered in battles 
with the Japanese despite its four-to-one advantage in troops overall. 69
 germany versus russia, 1891–1917 
 For most of the nineteenth century, Russia had the largest GDP and military in Europe. During this time, however, Russia suffered “a steady slackening of power and prestige” and a series of crushing military defeats that 
culminated in the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917. 70
 Russia had two main goals in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: to expand its empire in the Middle East and Asia while maintaining a 
balance of power in Europe. This strategy was wrecked in 1871 by the formation of Germany. 71 Although Russia initially allied with Germany and 
Austria-Hungary to contain France, Russia’s traditional rival, the rapid 
THE PILLARS OF POWER
27
growth of German power and disputes with Austria-Hungary in the Balkans compelled Russia to switch sides and ally with France in 1894. Germany, fi nding itself squeezed between two hostile powers, responded by 
building up its military and launching a preventive war to eliminate the 
Russian and French threat once and for all. 72
 The result—World War I—was catastrophic for Russia: Germany annihilated Russia’s army; exacted a large indemnity; and forced Russia to give 
up territory comprising parts of modern-day Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. Only Germany’s defeat by a coalition led by 
Britain, France, and the United States saved Russia from bearing the full 
brunt of these losses. Nevertheless, Russia was devastated by the war, and 
by 1920 it was engulfed in a bloody civil war and accounted for a mere 
2 percent of European industry. Russia would not return to the ranks of the 
great powers until the 1930s as the Soviet Union. 
 What explains Russia’s poor performance? The main issue was that Russia carried greater production, welfare, and security costs than Germany 
and thus had far fewer net resources available for geopolitical competition 
( fi gure 2.3 ). 
 For starters, in the early twentieth century, Russia was “the least developed European power,” lagging behind its neighbors in terms of per capita 
income, output per worker, and other measures of economic development 
such as literacy and health. 73 In 1910, Russia was only 40 percent as productive as Germany overall and 20 percent as productive in heavy 
industries. 74 
 In addition, most of Russia’s economic output was consumed by welfare 
costs. Russia’s GDP grew steadily during the nineteenth century, but nearly 
all of this growth stemmed from population growth. 75 The demands of 
feeding this growing population forced 90 percent of Russia’s labor force

into agriculture, which accounted for half or more of Russia’s entire economic output even as late as 1913. 76 With so many mouths to feed, Russia 
failed to accumulate wealth at the rate of other great powers: while the real 
per capita wealth of Germany grew 3 percent annually from 1890 to 1917, 
Russia’s increased by only 1 percent. 77
 Security costs also took a large toll on Russia’s economy. With a territory 
that stretched across one-sixth of the Earth’s landmass, Russia had to maintain large military forces just to police its own borders and prevent remote 
regions from breaking away. 78 From 1870 to 1913, peacetime defense spending consumed 5 percent of Russia’s GDP and 80 percent of the Russian government’s revenues annually. In Germany, by contrast, peacetime defense 
spending accounted for 3 percent of GDP. 79
 Russia’s army was twice the size of Germany’s and was backed by a bigger budget, but Germany’s advantages in technology and skill enabled it to 
outfi ght Russia on a soldier-for-soldier basis. Whereas German troops were 
well-trained and armed, a majority of Russian troops were untrained conscripts sent into battle without rifl es, where they were expected to scavenge 
weapons from the dead. 80 Russia also lacked railroads in its western 
regions, so it had extreme diffi culty moving its armies around the RussoGerman border. 81 Germany, on the other hand, had a well-developed railroad system, so it could move its forces quickly to that same border. 
 Security costs also sapped Russian military power. As Yale Historian Paul 
Kennedy notes, “The great part of the Russian army was always pinned 
down by internal garrison duties, by police actions in Poland and the 
Ukraine, and by other activities, such as border patrol.” 82 As a result, “in 
every war waged by Russia throughout the reign [of the Russian Empire], 
its generals were chronically embarrassed by a shortage of troops.” 83 This 
shortage became acute in the fi ve years prior to World War I, when mass 
uprisings increased tenfold and the Russian Revolution gathered pace. 84 
 united states versus soviet union, 1946–92 
 Russia temporarily fell from the ranks of the great powers after World 
War I. In 1922, however, Russia reconstituted itself as the Soviet Union, and 
in 1928 the Soviet government, led by Josef Stalin, began modernizing the 
economy through forced industrialization and the ruthless collectivization 
of agriculture. The Soviet Union suffered enormous losses in World War II, 
but it gained power in relative terms because its chief rivals, Germany and 
Japan, were utterly destroyed. As the allies dismantled the German and 
Japanese empires, the Soviet Union gobbled up territory in Eastern Europe 
and northeast Asia. 
 By 1945, the Soviet Union was the most powerful nation in Europe; by 
the 1950s it was widely regarded as a superpower; and by the 1970s, the 
Soviet Union led the world by most measures of gross resources, including 
THE PILLARS OF POWER
29
CINC, army size, nuclear weapons, military spending, gross industrial output, R&D intensity, and employment of scientists and engineers. 85 In 1977, 
Ray Cline, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency’s chief Soviet analyst, 
famously combined many of these gross indicators into a single power 
index and concluded that the Soviet Union was twice as powerful as the 
United States and getting stronger. 86
 Yet between 1970 and 1991, the Soviet Union lost two million square 
miles of territory—a chunk of land nearly twice the size of India—and all of 
its client states in Eastern Europe, withdrew in defeat from Central Asia, 
accepted onerous arms-control agreements, and opened up sectors of its 
economy to Western corporations. 87 Rather than orchestrate a soft landing 
for its rival, the United States engaged in “intense predation” by backing 
independence movements within the Soviet Union and absorbing a 
reunited Germany into NATO. 88 In 1989, the Soviet Union called off the 
Cold War, and in 1991 the Soviet Union itself broke apart into fi fteen states, 
leaving the United States standing as the world’s sole superpower. 89
 How could this happen? With the benefi t of hindsight, it is clear that the 
Soviet Union, for all of its vast size, was an ineffi cient state lumbering under 
large production, welfare, and security costs ( fi gure 2.4 ). 
 The Soviet Union literally had the “worst performing economy in the 
world” in the 1970s and 1980s: its productivity was negative, its outputcapital ratios declined steadily, and it became the fi rst industrialized 
nation in history to record peacetime declines in life expectancy and infant 
mortality. 90 The Soviets grew their economy during this time, but did so 
mainly through “perspiration rather than inspiration”—by working 
harder, not smarter. 91 By the 1980s, Soviet industries were using twice as 
many raw material and energy inputs as American industries but producing half the output. 92

 The U.S. productivity advantage was particularly pronounced in hightechnology sectors. 93 The Soviet Union employed nearly twice as many scientists and engineers as the United States and spent nearly twice as much on 
R&D as a share of GDP. 94 But the Soviet Union’s massive science projects 
(so-called Projects of the Century) failed to produce breakthroughs and succeeded only in swallowing up ever-greater shares of Soviet resources. 95
Although R&D spending and scientifi c employment steadily increased from 
the 1960s to the 1980s, the number of Soviet inventions, prototypes, patents, 
profi table products, and international scientifi c prizes declined sharply relative to those of the United States. 96 In 1985, U.S. technology companies sold 
7 million computers while the Soviet Union produced only 9,000. 97 
 Welfare costs also eroded Soviet wealth. Soviet social assistance programs depleted half of government revenues annually. 98 Food subsidies 
alone consumed 30 percent of the Soviet budget in the 1980s. 99 In the United 
States, by contrast, all food, housing, and other social assistance programs 
combined accounted for less than 10 percent of the budget. 100 By the 1980s, 
the only industry generating profi ts in the Soviet Union was the oil industry, and according to Soviet estimates, nearly 75 percent of annual oil revenues were spent on entitlements for food, housing, and social programs. 101
 Security costs also took their toll on Soviet wealth. Defense spending 
consumed roughly 40 percent of the Soviet budget and 15 to 20 percent of 
GDP—a share at least four times the U.S. level. 102 Both superpowers had 
globe-spanning military commitments, but as Dartmouth scholars Stephen 
Brooks and William Wohlforth have shown, the “relative costs of the United 
States’ empire by invitation were not nearly as large as the imperial costs 
faced by the Soviets, who arguably confronted modern history’s worst case 
of imperial overstretch.” 103 The Soviet Union spent 2 to 4 percent of its GDP 
annually propping up the economies and militaries of its allies with aid, 
arms transfers, implicit trade subsidies, and export credits. 104 The United 
States, by contrast, spent 0.3 percent of its GDP annually on all forms of 
foreign assistance combined. 105
 The Soviet military, too, suffered from production, welfare, and security 
costs. Despite spending 2 to 3 percent of its GDP on military R&D, Soviet 
technology lagged behind U.S. technology by a generation or more in fi fteen of the twenty most critical military technologies, as identifi ed by the 
U.S. Department of Defense, and was merely on par with U.S. technology 
in the remaining fi ve categories. 106 Furthermore, the Soviet military was 
hobbled by a rigid command structure, and its offi cers lacked initiative; its 
troops lacked basic skills, like map reading; language barriers created serious communication problems among different divisions; and 25 percent of 
Soviet forces were made up of fresh conscripts with little to no training. 107
 Soviet forces trained so little in part because Soviet weapons systems 
were so fragile; for example, Soviet fi ghters required overhauls at triple 
the rate of many Western aircraft, and Soviet tank engines wore out after 
THE PILLARS OF POWER
31
500 hours or less of use. 108 Plagued by equipment failures, the government 
kept most weapons systems “packed away like a family’s best china,” using 
them only for special exercises once or twice a year. 109 The resulting skill 
defi ciencies, plus the technology issues mentioned above, probably made a 
Soviet conquest of Central Europe impossible. 110
 Finally, and perhaps most important, the Soviet military confronted 
an extremely hostile security environment. 111 By the 1980s, the United 
States had six times as many allies as the Soviet Union. Facing a robust 
Western containment barrier abroad and disaffected citizens at home, 
the Soviet Union had to expend significant resources just to defend its 
borders and prevent restive regions and satellite countries from breaking away. The United States, by contrast, enjoyed a secure home base in 
the Western Hemisphere and dozens of rich allies around the world. It 
therefore had more leeway to choose where and when to project military 
power and was able to offload part of the burden of defending the free 
world to others. 
 additional evidence 
 The historical cases discussed above strongly suggest that power is a 
function of net stocks of resources, not gross fl ows. But does this pattern 
hold for other cases? In a separate and more technical study, I demonstrate 
that the relationship between power and net stocks of resources does, in 
fact, apply broadly to all states, not just to the great powers. 112
 Specifi cally, I show that victory and defeat in hundreds of international 
disputes and wars over the past two hundred years has depended mainly 
on which side had larger net stocks of resources. Gross fl ow indicators, 
by contrast, perform little better than a coin toss at predicting the winners and losers of these confl icts. Israel, for example, had a smaller economy, military, and population than its Arab neighbors but nevertheless 
won most of its disputes and wars with them, because it was more economically and militarily effi cient and, thus, had a larger net stock of resources 
to draw on. 
 I also show that net indicators perform better than gross indicators as a 
control variable when plugged into statistical models of international relations. Many quantitative studies control for power to isolate correlations 
among other variables (e.g., between the level of trade between two countries and their likelihood of going to war, between a country’s regime type 
and the likelihood that it signs international treaties, etc.). I replicate a random sample of two dozen studies and substitute measures of gross and net 
resources to see how each power indicator affects the models’ in-sample 
goodness of fi t, which measures how well the model accounts for the variance in the data. Substituting measures of net resources for gross resources 
improves the model fi t roughly 75 percent of the time. 
CHAPTER 2
32
 From Past to Present 
 The rise and fall of the great powers and the outcomes of international disputes and wars over the past two hundred years show that net stocks of 
wealth and military assets are the key pillars of power. By contrast, gross 
indicators systematically overstate the power of populous countries. 
 With this point in mind, I now turn to the current balance of power. 
 Chapter 3 analyzes trends in the international distribution of wealth, and 
 chapter 4 analyzes military trends. In both chapters, I focus on China, 
because it is the only country that could match the United States in net 
resources anytime soon. This point is clearly shown in fi gure 2.5 . 
 Japan, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany are almost as effi cient 
as the United States, but they lack the size necessary to contend for superpower status. Russia has neither the size nor the effi ciency to contend. India 
will soon have the world’s largest population, but it is nowhere close to 
rivaling China in net resources, let alone the United States. If the United 
States faces a peer competitor in the twenty-fi rst century, therefore, it will 
surely be China.

 Economic Trends 
 The United States is several times wealthier than China, and the absolute gap 
is growing by trillions of dollars each year. Obviously this conclusion cuts 
against the conventional wisdom that China is an economic juggernaut. It also 
fl ies in the face of data showing that China has a bigger GDP (measured by 
purchasing power parity) and a faster economic growth rate than the United 
States. Nevertheless, the large and persistent wealth gap between the United 
States and China is real and can be documented with considerable evidence. 
 Figure 3.1 provides a fi rst look at this evidence by showing three estimates 
of U.S. and Chinese stocks of wealth. The fi rst two charts display estimates 
of each country’s total wealth and come from the United Nations’ Inclusive 
Wealth Index and the World Bank’s Comprehensive Wealth database 
described in chapter 2 . The third is an estimate of private wealth produced 
by Credit Suisse. Despite using different data and methods, these indicators 
show a similar result: the United States is several times wealthier than 
China, and the absolute gap is growing by trillions of dollars. This result is 
similar to the picture presented by the crude indicator of net resources (GDP 
× GDP per capita) introduced in the previous chapter ( fi gure 2.5 ). 
 How can China be poorer than the United States when it has a larger 
GDP? And how can China be trailing the United States economically when 
its growth rate is several times higher? 
 The main reason, as I explain below, is that China is big but ineffi cient. It 
produces vast output but at high costs. Chinese businesses suffer from 
chronically high production costs, and China’s 1.4 billion people impose 
substantial welfare and security burdens. The United States, by contrast, is 
big and effi cient. American businesses are among the most productive in 
the world, and with four times fewer people than China, the United States 
has lower welfare and security costs. Gross domestic product ignores the 
cost side of the equation and creates the false impression that China is overtaking the United States economically. In reality, China is lagging behind, 
because its ineffi cient growth model and the costs of caring for 20 percent of 
humanity exhaust most of its economic output. 
CHAPTER 3

 To develop this argument, I follow the approach of the UN and the World 
Bank in dividing stocks of wealth into three broad categories: human, produced, and natural capital. For each category, I present the aggregate estimates provided by the UN’s Inclusive Wealth Report and the World Bank’s 
Comprehensive Wealth database. 1
 Then I dig deeper by evaluating subindicators of each type of wealth. 
 One cautionary note before proceeding: many of the statistics below are 
based on Chinese government data that probably exaggerate China’s economic output. Dozens of studies have shown that Chinese offi cials systematically infl ate China’s numbers, and top Chinese leaders, including the 
premier and the head of China’s National Statistics Bureau, have admitted 
as much. 2
 Many economists believe that China’s true economic growth rate 
is roughly half the government-listed rate, and some analysts argue that 
China’s economy has not grown since the 2008 fi nancial crisis. 3
 If these 
claims are true, then the statistics I present below drastically understate the 
U.S.-China wealth gap. For the sake of conservatism, however, I take Chinese government data at face value. 
 Human Capital 
 According to the World Bank and the UN, human capital—the knowledge, 
skills, and labor embodied in a nation’s population—constitutes more than 
half of the wealth of most countries and as much as 80 percent of the wealth

 Figure 3.2 shows that the U.S. stock of human 
capital is several times greater than China’s. 5
 This result is surprising given 
that China has 1 billion more people than the United States, a higher labor 
force participation rate (70 percent versus 60 percent), and U.S.-China trade 
since 1999 may have put 2 million American manufacturing workers out of 
a job. 6
 The reason the United States retains a larger stock of human capital 
despite these factors is that it has lower production, welfare, and security 
costs. I explain each below. 
 production costs 
 Americans workers are the most productive in the world and generate 
roughly seven times the output of Chinese workers on average ( fi gure 3.3 ). 
China’s labor productivity has improved since the 1970s, but remains half 
that of Turkey, lower than Mexico’s, and roughly on par with Brazil’s. There 
are three main reasons that American workers are more productive than 
Chinese workers: education, health, and organization. 
 Education. Americans receive twice as many years of schooling as Chinese workers on average. 7
 Whereas public school is free through high 
school in the United States, China’s government only covers the costs of 
elementary and middle school. At many Chinese high schools, families 
have to pay tuition and other expenses, and these outlays are among the 
highest in the world. 8
 Many students drop out to avoid these fees. Consequently, 76 percent of China’s working-age population has not completed

high school; and roughly one-third of the children currently entering the 
workforce have an IQ below 90 and are barely literate or numerate. 9
 China is trying to narrow the gap in educational attainment by expanding access to higher education. Since 2000, China has doubled its number 
of universities and increased its tertiary enrollment rate (the share of 
high school graduates that enroll in college) from 8 to 30 percent. 10 Nevertheless, only 10 percent of China’s workforce has a college degree, 
compared to 44 percent of the U.S. workforce, and the quality of Chinese 
universities has not kept pace with the surge in quantity. 11 Many Chinese 
college students describe their schools as “diploma factories,” where 
student-teacher ratios are double the average in U.S. universities, cheating is rampant, students spend a quarter of their time studying “Mao 
Zedong thought,” and students and professors are denied access to basic 
sources of information, such as Google Scholar and certain academic 
journal repositories. 12 
 For these reasons, China still has only two of the world’s top one hundred universities and only seven of the top two hundred, despite spending 
hundreds of billions of dollars trying to create a Chinese “Ivy League.” 13
The United States, by contrast, accounts for fi fty of the top one hundred 
universities and seventy-seven of the top two hundred. 14
Detailed studies fi nd that many graduates of Chinese universities lack 
basic reading and writing skills and less than 10 percent of Chinese engineering graduates are fi t to work for a foreign multinational company. 15
 According to some surveys of CEOs, the United States has a “skills gap” 
of roughly 4 million workers, supposedly because too many American

students major in subjects like art history and philosophy instead of business, engineering, or computer science. 16 However, there are good reasons 
to doubt these fi ndings: 4 million job vacancies is hardly unusual in an 
economy the size of America’s; college enrollments in science, engineering, 
and business programs are actually at all-time highs; the liberal arts are 
quite useful for jobs in an information economy that runs on creativity and 
critical thinking; and careful studies suggest that CEOs may be hyping the 
idea of a skills gap to get the government to pay for job training programs 
that companies otherwise would have to pay for themselves. 17 Regardless, 
if CEO surveys are valid measures of human capital, then China is in trouble, because such surveys fi nd that China has a skills gap of 24 million 
workers and is projected to have a skills gap of 40 million workers by 2030. 18
 Compounding China’s talent problem is that it loses 400,000 workers 
every year to foreign countries in net terms, including tens of thousands of 
scientists and engineers and roughly 6,000 “inventors,” meaning people that 
have registered at least one patent. 19 The total scope of China’s “brain drain” 
problem is unknown, but U.S. government data show that the United States 
alone absorbs 3,500 Chinese scientists and engineers each year and nets 1 million workers annually from all foreign countries, including roughly 20,000 
“inventors” and 10,000 scientists and engineers ( fi gure 3.4 ). 
 The Chinese government is trying to reverse this brain drain by spending 
billions of dollars on its “1,000 Talents” scheme, which lures scholars and 
scientists from abroad with fi ve-year positions at Chinese institutions 
and $160,000 in cash. According to the most comprehensive study of the

program, however, 1,000 Talents has failed to bolster China’s human capital, for several reasons: 20 more than 90 percent of the awardees have been 
over forty-fi ve years old, a major problem, because scholars and scientists 
are generally most productive before the age of forty-fi ve; 21 nearly 90 percent of the participants were already living in China when they received 
their award (Chinese universities receive $2 million for every scholar they 
recruit, so when schools failed to attract scholars from abroad, they simply 
gave awards to local scholars and collected the $2 million); 75 percent of the 
scholars recruited from foreign countries kept their tenured positions 
abroad and worked only part-time in China during the fellowship period, 
contributing little to China’s knowledge base; and 70 percent of the 
recruited scholars said they intended to leave China after the fellowship. 22
 Health. The U.S. workforce is not only better educated but also healthier 
than China’s. Figure 3.3 shows the number of years of healthy life the United 
States and China lose per thousand people to common diseases and injuries, 
a metric known as a disability-adjusted life year (DALY). China loses roughly 
40 percent more years of productive life per capita on average from these 
major ailments ( fi gure 3.5 ). According to Yanzhong Huang, a scholar at the 
Council on Foreign Relations, the rising costs of China’s disease burden is 
“cancelling out the gains from economic growth”; from 2003 to 2010 China’s 
GDP increased by 193 percent, but the costs of disease increased by 197 
percent. 23

 There are three main reasons Americans are healthier than China’s citizens: better healthcare, a less toxic environment, and healthier habits. 
 Access to healthcare in China is abysmal for all but the wealthy elite. In 
2009, the government established a universal healthcare scheme, but premiums under this program are only twenty-four dollars, a sum far from 
suffi cient to cover a basic checkup, let alone a major procedure. 24 Half of 
Chinese healthcare spending comes out of pocket, and many Chinese citizens avoid medical care altogether. 25 One-third of people who are told to go 
to a hospital decide not to because of the cost, and 80 percent of rural residents diagnosed with serious illnesses die at home because they cannot 
afford medical care. 26 The United States has one of the most expensive and 
ineffi cient healthcare systems in the world, as I discuss later, but it provides 
far greater access and care than China’s system. 
 In addition to receiving better healthcare, American live in a less toxic 
environment. Air pollution is seven times worse in China than in the United 
States ( fi gure 3.6 ) and kills 1.6 million Chinese citizens each year versus 
200,000 Americans. 27 Breathing Beijing’s air is the equivalent of smoking 
forty cigarettes a day. 28 Whereas nearly all Americans enjoy clean water out 
of the tap, 90 percent of China’s groundwater is polluted to some degree. 29
Every year, 190 million Chinese fall ill and 60,000 die because of water 
pollution. 30 Combined, air and water pollution cost China an estimated 
7.5 percent of GDP annually—roughly a trillion dollars—in lost productivity and medical expenses. 31

 Finally, Americans generally have healthier habits than Chinese citizens. China’s smoking rate, for example, is 50 percent higher than America’s and projected to be 70 percent higher by 2025. China’s rates of 
diabetes and prediabetes also recently surpassed America’s, mainly 
because of poor nutrition. 32 The one ailment that affl icts Americans much 
more than Chinese citizens is substance abuse: U.S. rates of alcohol consumption are 50 percent higher than China’s, and Americans are ten 
times more likely than Chinese citizens to die of a drug overdose. 33 As 
awful as America’s substance abuse problem is, however, its toll does not 
compare to the collective toll taken by China’s multiple health crises, as 
evidenced by the DALY data in fi gure 3.5 . For example, the United States 
loses six more years of productive life per thousand people from substance abuse, but China loses sixteen more years from heart disease and 
another eight from cancer. 
 The Chinese government is working hard to solve these health problems, but the health gap between China and the United States will 
expand in the years ahead for a simple reason: China is aging more rapidly than any society in history. The number of Chinese aged sixty-five 
and older will more than triple by midcentury, from 130 million in 2015 
to 410 million by 2055 ( figure 3.7 ). At that point, senior citizens will 
account for nearly one-third of China’s population versus only 20 percent of the U.S. population. Given that most health problems get worse 
with age, the graying of China’s society essentially guarantees a decline 
in the productivity of China’s workforce and an erosion of China’s stock 
of human capital.

 Organization. A third element of human capital is organization. A worker 
in Switzerland may produce more than one in Somalia, not because she is 
smarter or healthier, but because she works in a more organized society 
where resources are allocated effi ciently, innovation and entrepreneurship 
are rewarded, and the trains run on time. 
 One attempt at measuring economic organization is the World Bank’s 
“Doing Business Report,” which scores countries according to the ease 
with which businesses can operate. In the latest report, the United States 
ranks seventh—after Singapore, New Zealand, Denmark, South Korea, 
Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom—and ahead of Sweden, Norway, 
and Finland. China ranks eighty-fourth, just behind Guatemala and Bosnia Herzegovina and just ahead of El Salvador and Uzbekistan. Whereas 
the United States is at or near the world frontier in virtually every aspect of 
doing business, China generally ranks in the middle of the global pack 
( fi gure 3.8 ). A smaller database, the World Economic Forum’s Competitiveness Index, shows a similar U.S.-China gap in economic organization: 
the United States ranks third, behind only Switzerland and Singapore; 
China ranks twenty-eighth, behind Saudi Arabia and just ahead of Estonia 
and Thailand. 
 Qualitative research confi rms these quantitative assessments. Numerous 
studies show that private companies in China face severe challenges in 
obtaining loans and permits, registering their business, and seeking recourse 
for damages and expropriation—unless they have political connections to

the Communist Party. 34 Entrepreneurs in China have reported spending 
roughly 70 percent of their time schmoozing with party members, because 
political connections are crucial to gain access to capital and to reduce exposure to taxes and regulations. 35 Obviously political connections help tremendously in American business as well. 36 But crony capitalism—whether 
measured by corruption indexes, social network analyses, or investigative 
reports—is several times greater in China than in the United States. 37 
 welfare and security costs 
 Welfare costs drain more of China’s human capital than America’s for 
one simple reason: agriculture. Whereas the United States can feed itself 
with only 1 percent of its workforce in agriculture, China devotes 30 percent of its workforce to farming—and still depends on food imports to 
feed its population. 38 China suffers a massive opportunity cost from having so many workers in the fi elds—the productivity level of Chinese agriculture is one-fourth that of the rest of the economy, and most of China’s 
agricultural output is immediately consumed and therefore does not add 
to China’s stock of wealth. 39 Economic development is, at its core, a process of structural change from agriculture to industry; the fewer farmers a 
nation uses to feed itself, the more workers it can mobilize to produce 
wealth in modern industries. 40 The United States has 99 percent of its 
workforce potentially available for wealth creation whereas China only 
has 70 percent. 
 The share of farmers in China’s economy will decline as China’s economy develops, but this process will take time given China’s growing 
demand for food and chronically low agricultural productivity. Currently, 
many of China’s 240 million farmers struggle to feed even themselves, 
because their supplies of water and land are dwindling due to pollution 
and overuse; in 2016, the average Chinese farmer had less than a football 
fi eld of land to work with, compared to 400 football fi elds for the average 
American farmer. 41
 The United States and China devote similar shares (10 to 15 percent) of 
their human capital to other public welfare tasks. 42 China has a large 
socialist administration for a developing country, with more bureaucrats 
and social service workers per capita than any country in Asia except 
Malaysia, whereas the United States devotes a slightly smaller share of its 
workforce to public welfare and administration than the average developed country. 43 
 Security costs, however, take a larger toll on America’s human capital 
than China’s. Although the two countries have roughly the same share of 
their labor forces employed in law enforcement, homeland security, and the 
military, the U.S. incarceration rate is fi ve times greater than China’s. With 
2.2 million prisoners and another 5 million people on probation or parole, 
ECONOMIC TRENDS
43
the United States leads the world in incarceration and has more people 
under criminal justice control than the Soviet Union imprisoned under Stalin. 44 The United States incarcerates people for acts that other countries do 
not consider crimes (drug possession, prostitution, accidentally violating 
obtuse regulations) and imposes long sentences for minor offences; under 
“three strikes” rules, petty thieves have been jailed for life. 45
 This prison industrial complex is not only morally abhorrent, it removes 
3 percent of working-age Americans from the labor force and devastates 
minority communities—eight percent of black men aged twenty-fi ve to 
fi fty-four are institutionalized, and one in nine black children has a parent 
behind bars. 46 Given that children of incarcerated parents are more likely to 
drop out of school and develop learning disabilities and health problems, 
the economic and social impact of America’s addiction to incarceration 
goes far beyond the loss of able-bodied adults. 47
 Produced Capital 
 The U.S. stock of produced capital—manmade goods and infrastructure—
is two to three times larger than China’s ( fi gure 3.9 ), and this estimate 
understates the true gap, because one-third of China’s GDP and 90 percent 
of its high-technology goods are produced by foreign fi rms that have 
merely set up factories in China to snap together components produced 
elsewhere. 48 This practice, known as “export processing,” accounts for 90 percent of China’s high-technology exports and 100 percent of China’s trade 
surplus. 49 On average, of every dollar an American consumer spends on an 
item labeled “Made in China,” 55 cents go for components and services 
produced in the United States. 50 In other words, more than half of the content of “Made in China” is American. 51
 Even without deducting the foreign-produced share of China’s economic 
output, the United States still has at least two times the stock of produced 
capital as China. This fi nding may surprise people, given that China has a 
larger GDP in purchasing power parity terms, invests $600 billion more 
than the United States every year in physical capital, and has over $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. How can China outproduce and outinvest the United States—and own nearly $1.2 trillion in U.S. debt—yet still 
have a substantially smaller stock of produced capital? 
 The main reason, as I explain below, is that China has much higher production costs than the United States. China’s rapid growth in output over 
the past twenty-fi ve years has stemmed not from innovation and productivity but from capital and labor inputs; from perspiration rather than 
inspiration. China has been spending money to make money, and like the 
Soviet Union before it, China has been spending more and more to earn 
less and less.

 production costs 
 Gross domestic product growth is not necessarily a sign of expanding 
wealth. If a country spends billions of dollars building bridges to nowhere, 
its GDP will rise but its stock of wealth will remain unchanged or even 
decline. To accumulate wealth, a country needs to increase its productivity, 
which implies a sustained rise in output produced per unit of input, a metric that economists call total factor productivity (TFP). Mere increases in 
input, without an increase in the effi ciency with which those inputs are 
used, will suffer diminishing returns and wrack up debt. 
 How productive is China’s economy? Remarkably, 90 to 97 percent of 
China’s economic growth since 1990 has stemmed from growth in inputs: 
the expansion of employment and relentless investment in physical capital. 52 China’s TFP growth has not only been unspectacular, it has been virtually nonexistent, accounting for only 3 to 10 percent of China’s growth 
during that time. By contrast, productivity improvements have accounted 
for 20 to 25 percent of U.S. economic growth for the past century. 53
 Many people assume that China is becoming more productive over time, 
but China’s TFP growth rate has actually turned negative in recent years, 
meaning that China is producing less output per unit of input each year. 54
Meanwhile Chinese investment spending has climbed to nearly 50 percent 
of China’s GDP—a level “unprecedented in world economic history”—and 
accounted for nearly all of China’s economic growth. 55
ECONOMIC TRENDS
45
 Over the same time period, American TFP has grown at roughly 1 percent a year—hardly impressive, but at least moving in the right direction—
and America’s output-to-capital ratio (the wealth produced for every dollar 
invested) has surpassed China’s ( fi gure 3.10) , a remarkable development 
because output-to-capital ratios are usually higher in developing countries, 
where greenfi eld investment opportunities (i.e., lucrative investments in 
untapped areas) are more plentiful than in developed countries. 
 The inescapable conclusion from these numbers is that much of China’s 
investment spending is wasted. How much, exactly, is diffi cult to say, but the 
Chinese government estimates that it blew more than $6 trillion on “ineffective investment” between 2009 and 2014. 56 This waste stems from two main 
sources: extravagant infrastructure projects and industrial overcapacity. 
 China’s mega-infrastructure projects look impressive, but roughly 60 percent of them cost more to build than they will ever generate in economic 
returns. 57 For example, China has built more than fi fty “ghost cities”—entire 
metropolises composed of empty offi ce buildings, apartment complexes, 
shopping malls, and, in some cases, airports. 58 Americans often complain 
about the “crumbling” infrastructure in the United States, 59 but the World 
Economic Forum ranks U.S. infrastructure far ahead of China’s (11th versus 
42nd), partly because the United States is blessed with an abundance of natural infrastructure (e.g. internal waterways, natural harbors, etc.), a point I 
expand upon in chapter 5, and partly because so much of China’s manmade 
infrastructure is useless. 60

 Overcapacity is also common in Chinese industries, with roughly onethird of China’s industrial production going to waste. 61 In industry after 
industry, from refi ning to shipbuilding to aluminum to cement, the picture 
is the same—supply far outpaces demand—and still expansion continues. 62
For example, China’s unused capacity in steelmaking is greater than the 
total steel capacity of the United States, Japan, and Germany combined. 63
 Chinese offi cials hope that their Belt and Road initiative, which aims to 
reconstitute the Silk Road by investing $1 trillion in infrastructure projects 
in sixty-nine countries between China and Europe, can mop up excess 
capacity and spread Chinese infl uence across Eurasia. 64 The scheme may 
indeed boost Chinese soft power, as I discuss in chapter 5 , but it also will 
probably exacerbate China’s economic woes, because it funds hundreds of 
fi nancially dubious projects in unstable countries, more than half of which 
have credit ratings below investment-grade. 65 The Chinese government 
estimates that it will lose 80 percent of the value of its investments in South 
Asia, 50 percent in Southeast Asia, and 30 percent in Central Asia; 66 and 
Chinese bankers and executives complain privately that the central government is pressuring them to undertake unprofi table projects, 67 such as building railways across Central Asia that will ship goods at more than twice the 
cost of shipping by sea. 68
 The unsurprising result of China’s wasted investment has been a dramatic 
rise in debt, from 100 percent of GDP in the 1990s to more than 255 percent 
in 2017 ( fi gure 3.11 ). 69 At $30 trillion and counting, China’s debt is not only 
the largest ever recorded by a developing country, it has risen faster than 
any country’s, quadrupling in absolute size between 2007 and 2017.

 American debt is massive too, but it has stabilized at a lower level than 
China’s and is less burdensome. As anyone that has taken out a loan knows, 
the wealthier you are, the more debt you can carry. With a per capita income 
six times greater than China’s, the United States not only has more surplus 
wealth to pay down its debts, but also enjoys lower interest rates. 70 The fact 
that the dollar is the world’s reserve currency further reduces U.S. borrowing costs—an “exorbitant privilege” that saves U.S. debtors an estimated 
$100 billion in interest payments every year. 71
 Without these privileges, China’s household and corporate borrowers 
have been hit with rising interest rates that now consume 20 percent of China’s GDP. 72 Roughly a quarter of China’s thousand biggest fi rms owe more 
money in interest than they earn in gross profi ts; and 45 percent of all new 
loans in China are being used to pay interest on old loans, a phenomenon 
that analysts call “Ponzi fi nance.” 73
 Many bankers—93 percent, according to one survey—believe that China’s 
debt is worse than the above data indicate and actually exceeds 300 percent 
of GDP. 74 One reason is that Chinese banks have severely underreported 
nonperforming loans (i.e., loans that will not be paid back). According to an 
analysis by Goldman Sachs, 7 percent of Chinese bank loans are nonperforming. 75 To put that number in perspective, consider that the U.S. nonperforming loan ratio peaked at 5.6 percent at the height of the 2008 fi nancial 
crisis. 76 
 Another reason China’s debt may be understated is that many Chinese 
companies take loans from shadow banks, whose transactions are not 
included in offi cial Chinese statistics. Such “back-alley banking” has become 
rampant in recent years. 77 From 2010 to 2012 alone, Chinese shadow lenders doubled their outstanding loans to $5.8 trillion—a sum equivalent to 69 
percent of China’s GDP and more than seven times the size of the stimulus 
package the United States rolled out to recover from the 2008 fi nancial 
crisis—and from 2012 to 2016, Chinese shadow loans increased by an additional 30 percent each year. 78
 China may avoid a full-blown fi nancial crisis—the state owns both the 
banks and their biggest corporate borrowers, and Chinese citizens have little choice but to keep their savings in state-owned banks—but writing off 
these bad loans will cost China somewhere between $1.5 trillion and $10 
trillion, the latter fi gure nearly equal to China’s entire GDP. 79 By comparison, during the global fi nancial crisis, the direct cost of rescuing U.S. banks 
was about 8 percent of GDP. 80
 China has $3 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, but they are not a 
treasure-trove that the Chinese government can use to pay off its debts. 81
The Chinese government purchased these reserves with money taken from 
state-owned banks, most of which was deposited there by Chinese citizens. 
If the government were to spend that money, it would be stealing $3 trillion 
from the Chinese people—a move that would probably collapse the 
CHAPTER 3
48
banking system, as people would not likely put more money in banks that 
just expropriated their life-savings. 
 Ultimately, the only way for China to solve its debt problem without gutting social spending is to increase its productivity, which in turn will require 
innovation. The Chinese government understands this point well. Since 
2006, it has tripled its spending on research and development (R&D), employed 
more scientists and engineers than any other country, and mounted the 
most extensive corporate espionage campaign in history. 82
 So far, however, these measures have failed to turn China into an innovation powerhouse. As shown in fi gure 3.12 , China lags far behind the United 
States by all standard measures of innovation, including profi ts, patents, and 
royalties in high-technology industries and highly cited scientifi c articles. 
 China has developed pockets of economic excellence. For example, China 
leads the world in some manufacturing industries—especially in the production 
of household appliances, textiles, steel, solar panels, and simple drones—because 
its huge population of poor workers and generous government subsidies enable

it to function as the “workshop of the world,” churning out commodifi ed goods 
at low prices. 83 China also has the world’s largest e-commerce market and 
mobile payments system and commands respectable shares of global markets 
for Internet software and communications equipment—mainly because the 
Chinese government restricts foreign Internet and telecommunications fi rms 
from operating in China, thereby giving Chinese fi rms, such as Alibaba, 
Baidu, and Tencent, a captive market of a billion people. 84 
 However, in high-technology industries, meaning those that involve the 
commercial application of scientifi c research (e.g., pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and semiconductors) or the engineering and integration of 
complex parts (e.g. aviation, medical devices, and system software), China 
generally accounts for small shares of global markets compared to the 
United States. 85 China is a major producer of many high-technology products, particularly computer and electronics technologies, but most Chinese 
fi rms in these industries are confi ned to low-tech, low-productivity activities, such as manufacturing and component supply whereas American 
fi rms tend to focus on product design, development, and branding—the 
activities in which profi ts and proprietary knowledge are greatest. 86
 As manufacturing has become increasingly automated with the development of 3D-printing and artifi cial intelligence, and as China’s labor costs 
have risen, American fi rms have started “reshoring” manufacturing plants 
in the United States to take advantage of low energy prices, high-skilled 
labor, and proximity to consumers. For those reasons, Deloitte and Boston 
Consulting Group both project that the United States will overtake China as 
the world’s most cost-competitive manufacturing nation by 2020. 87
 Technological leaders sometimes rest on their laurels and abandon innovative efforts in favor of “fi nding new markets for old products.” 88 The 
United States may be falling into this trap. The Trump administration has 
proposed reducing federal nondefense R&D spending by 20 percent, a 
move that would continue a long-term trend of declining government support for scientifi c research. Over the past thirty years, the American private 
sector has compensated for the decline in U.S. government support and 
driven overall U.S. R&D spending to all-time highs. 89 However, business 
R&D tends to focus on incremental innovations and the application and 
marketing of existing technologies, not on the invention of new “disruptive” technologies. By cutting government R&D spending, the United States 
risks stifl ing basic scientifi c research across a range of subjects and missing 
out on major breakthroughs as a result. 90
 Other worrying trends include the fact that the U.S. startup rate (the 
share of new fi rms in the total number) has declined by 50 percent since 
1978, and business deaths now outnumber business births for the fi rst time 
in generations. 91 American corporate profi ts are at all-time highs, but twothirds of U.S. economic sectors have become more concentrated among a 
handful of mega fi rms, a fact that suggests that rent seeking and price 
CHAPTER 3
50
gouging, rather than innovation, caused the rise in profi ts. 92 For example, 
the four airlines that now control 80 percent of the U.S. commercial airline 
market (compared to 48 percent a decade ago) have profi ted immensely in 
recent years by cramming more passengers onto planes without reducing 
ticket prices. 93
 The overall picture of the U.S. economy, then, is one of declining dynamism. Some economists dismiss these negative trends as a temporary 
hangover from the Great Recession or a statistical fl uke (standard industrialera indicators may not capture the economic benefi ts of new technologies 
like digital search engines, G.P.S.-generated directions, video chat, etc.). 94 A 
more worrying possibility, however, is that U.S. innovation is simply not 
what it used to be. The Internet and smartphones are great inventions, but 
they may not be as revolutionary as the innovations that propelled previous eras of U.S. productivity, such as the internal-combustion engine, electrifi cation, indoor plumbing, and commercial jetliners. 95
 Despite these worrying trends, however, the United States still outpaces 
China in most of the “industries of the future,” which include information 
industries that harness big data; machine industries that design advanced 
tools and robots; medical industries that create new drugs and healthcare 
technologies; and energy industries that produce alternatives to fossilfuels. 96 Figure 3.13 shows U.S. and Chinese relative shares of value added

(or patents when value-added data were unavailable) in these industries. 
With few exceptions, the United States has a commanding lead. 
 China performs well in alternative energy industries, largely because of 
government subsidies, as mentioned above. The same goes for supercomputers and quantum communications—two areas where China outspends 
the United States in R&D. 97 China also is becoming a world leader in some 
information and artifi cial intelligence (AI) industries, including digital payments and speech- and face-recognition. The main reason is that China has 
an abundance of data, the vital input to these industries. 98 In the past, software products were created by programmers typing code. With the advent 
of deep-learning algorithms, however, such products are increasingly based 
on reams of data. The more data available, the smarter the products will be. 
With nearly 730 million Internet users, China is the “Saudi Arabia of data;” 
just by going about their lives, China’s citizens generate more data than 
most other countries combined. 99 In most AI sectors, America still leads 
China in profi ts, patents, and number of companies. 100 But China could rapidly close the gap unless American fi rms develop algorithms capable of getting smart with less data (for example, by using simulated data, including 
data generated from video games). 101
 For now, the United States remains at the forefront of global innovation, 
accounting for almost a third of global high-technology revenues, nearly 
double China’s share. 102 China’s government has ordered Chinese scientists 
to catch up to the United States by 2050. 103 Rather than spurring innovation, 
however, this mandate has fostered “a Wild West climate where top 
researchers, under intense pressure to produce, are tempted to fake results 
or copy the works of others.” 104 According to a former Chinese biochemist 
turned whistle-blower, “misconduct is so widespread among Chinese academics that they have almost become used to it.” 105 China now leads the 
world in retractions of scientifi c studies due to fraud; one-third of Chinese 
scientists have admitted to plagiarizing or falsifying results (versus 2 percent of U.S. scientists); and two-thirds of China’s R&D spending has been 
lost to corruption. 106
 Chinese businesses, too, have generally failed to answer Beijing’s call for 
innovation. From 1991 to 2015, annual sales of new products accounted for 
less than 14 percent of Chinese fi rms’ annual profi ts. 107 For American fi rms, 
by contrast, new products accounted for 35 to 40 percent of sales revenue. 108
Over the same time period, Chinese fi rms’ total spending on R&D as a percentage of sales revenue stalled at levels four times below the average for 
American fi rms. 109 When Chinese fi rms imported foreign technology, they 
spent less than 25 percent of the total cost on absorbing the technology, a 
share far lower than the 200 to 300 percent spent by Korean and Japanese 
fi rms when they were trying to catch up to the West in the 1970s. 110 As a 
result, many Chinese fi rms remain dependent on foreign technologies and 
manual labor and have a rudimentary level of automation and digitization: 
CHAPTER 3
52
on average Chinese enterprises have just nineteen robots per ten thousand 
employees; U.S. fi rms, by contrast, use an average of 176 robots per ten 
thousand employees. 111
 For all these reasons, major studies on Chinese innovation generally 
paint a dismal picture. A joint study by the World Bank and the Chinese 
government fi nds that “China has seen a sharp rise in scientifi c patents and 
published papers, but few have commercial relevance and even fewer have 
translated into new products or exports.” 112 Another study by the Mercator 
Institute for China Studies predicts that China’s national innovation policy 
“will probably fail in its endeavor to catalyze a comprehensive, broad-scale 
technological upgrading across the Chinese economy. The strategy’s effectiveness is limited by the mismatch between political priorities and industry needs, the fi xation on quantitative targets, ineffi cient allocation of 
funding and campaign-style overspending by local governments.” 113
 welfare and security costs 
 In contrast to production costs, which affl ict China’s stocks of produced 
capital much more than America’s, U.S. and Chinese welfare and security 
costs basically cancel each other out: China spends more on food and has 
more unfunded pensions; the United States spends more on healthcare and 
security; and the two nations spend roughly equal amounts on education. 
 Food. China spends around $1 trillion per year on food, which is 30 percent more than the United States ( fi gure 3.14 ). China’s high cost of food 
stems from three main factors: high consumption, scarce land, and low 
agricultural productivity. China consumes double the meat and nine times 
as many cereals and grains as the United States, but has roughly half as 
much arable land and produces less than 70 percent as much food per 
hectare. 114 This imbalance will almost surely get worse, because China will 
have hundreds of millions more meat consumers in the coming decades 
barring a dramatic cultural shift toward vegetarianism. 115 Meanwhile 
China is projected to lose another 20 percent of its arable land to pollution 
and drought. 116 
 Social Security. China has at least $10 trillion in unfunded pension liabilities out to 2040, a shortfall that is $2.5 trillion greater than the United 
States’. 117 I say “at least” $10 trillion, because other studies calculate that 
China’s shortfall is more severe—a Bank of China/Deutsche Bank study, 
for example, calculates that China’s shortfall will reach $10.9 trillion in 
2033, while the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that by 2050 
there will be a $128 trillion gap. 118 Theoretically, China could reduce its 
pension gap by reducing payouts to retirees. In practice, however, such 
cost cutting is impossible, because Chinese retirees already receive 
ECONOMIC TRENDS
53
meager pensions—in some rural Chinese counties the basic pension is 
less than nine dollars per month. 119 Remarkably, these puny payouts have 
already exhausted China’s stock of pension assets. As a result, China is 
paying current-year benefi ts with current-year contributions, a pay-asyou-go scheme that will become unsustainable as China’s ratio of workers to retirees drops from 8-to-1 today to just over 2-to-1 by 2040. 120 The 
U.S. ratio, on the other hand, will hover at 3-to-1 and then start to rise 
after 2040. 
 Education Spending. The U.S. and Chinese governments both spend 
around $800 billion per year on education. 121 As noted, however, the United 
States provides free public school through high school whereas China’s 
government only covers the costs of elementary and middle school. 122 To 
address this problem, the Chinese government has proposed a massive 
increase in education spending. 123 If present trends continue, China will 
overtake the United States in education spending in the 2020s. 
 Healthcare. The United States spends $3 trillion on healthcare annually, 
compared to China’s $1 trillion. 124 The United States reaps some benefits 
from this largesse—as shown earlier, U.S. rates of disease are much lower 
than China’s, and Americans have more access to advanced medical 
technologies and drugs than Chinese citizens—but the fi scal costs are

enormous. Americans spend more than $10,000 per capita each year on 
healthcare and a whopping 18 percent of GDP in total. 125 
 In the coming decades, China’s healthcare spending will probably rise 
more rapidly that America’s, because China’s population is aging at a faster 
rate and China has higher rates of disease. The overall U.S.-China gap in 
healthcare spending, however, will probably remain greater than $1 trillion 
for the foreseeable future. 126
 security costs 
 The United States spends roughly $800 billion more than China per year 
on security ( fi gure 3.15 ). This estimate, however, is based on a maximalist 
interpretation of U.S. security spending that includes any funding remotely 
related to national defense, veterans affairs, foreign policy, homeland security, or domestic law enforcement. 127 China’s totals, by contrast, include 
only spending on “national defense” and “public security” as listed in the 
China Statistical Yearbook, a Chinese government publication. Many analysts

believe these totals drastically understate China’s true level of internal 
security spending, most of which is done off-budget. 128
 Regardless, the picture changes dramatically if we exclude military 
spending, which is arguably a source of power rather than a pure cost, 
and count only spending on homeland security. As shown in fi gure 3.15, 
 China’s homeland security costs are already greater than the United 
States’ and are projected to rise rapidly in the coming decades. The two 
main reasons are that China suffers from a much higher rate of domestic 
unrest than does the United States and faces more serious threats to its 
territorial integrity. 
 All major political risk indices show that China suffers roughly twice as 
much unrest and crime per capita as the United States and typically ranks 
in the bottom fourth of the world in domestic stability. 129 For example, the 
World Bank’s political stability and absence of violence index, which aggregates political risk data from more than thirty sources, ranks China 157th 
out of 212 countries, just ahead of Azerbaijan and Honduras, whereas the 
United States ranks 56th. Chinese government data paint a similar picture: 
so-called mass incidents (public protests or riots involving a hundred or 
more people) increased from 9,000 in 1993 to 280,000 in 2010; 130 and socalled social order violations, which refer to fi ghts or cases in which large 
groups of citizens obstructed police from their duties, have risen from 3.2 
million in 1995 to 13.9 million in 2012. 131 The Chinese government stopped 
releasing these fi gures to the public after 2012. 
 Unrest in China emanates from multiple sources. In Tibet and Xinjiang, 
which account for almost one-third of China’s landmass, non-Han ethnic 
groups wage low-level insurgencies against the central government. In 
Hong Kong, residents maintain a separate political system and periodically 
stage large protests against Beijing’s attempts to dilute their political autonomy. And throughout China, citizens harboring a variety of grievances—
for example, pollution, corruption, and government land seizures—stage 
demonstrations that sometimes turn violent. 
 In addition to containing domestic unrest, China must secure its land 
borders, which stretch fourteen thousand miles and include boundaries 
with fi fteen countries. 132 Most of these borders have been confl ict zones at 
some point in China’s history. Some of them remain so today. 
 Most notable, China shares a bitterly contested fourteen-hundred-mile border with India. 133 In the northern section, China occupies an area of Indianclaimed territory the size of Switzerland. In the eastern part, India occupies 
Chinese-claimed territory the size of Austria. Both sides maintain a massive 
military presence near the border: China has built air bases, roads, and railways capable of surging 450,000 troops to the border; India keeps four divisions on the border armed with long-range cruise missiles and backed up by 
two fi ghter squadrons. In the summer of 2017, Chinese and Indian forces had 
their most tense border standoff since the 1962 Sino-Indian border war. 
CHAPTER 3
56
 China’s eight-hundred-mile border with Vietnam also remains tense. 134
When anti-Chinese protests erupted in Vietnam in 2014 (after China placed 
an oil rig inside Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone), China deployed thousands of troops, tanks, missile launchers, and other heavy artillery to Pingxiang city, where the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war started. In 2014 and 2015, 
Chinese and Vietnamese forces exchanged fi re on at least two occasions, 
and both countries withdrew from border peace talks in 2017. 
 China’s other land borders are less militarized, but they still require 
attention and resources from Chinese security forces. China and Russia formally resolved their border dispute in 2008—the two countries fought a 
war there in 1969—but both countries have modernized their forces near 
the border and conduct military exercises simulating a Sino-Russian war. 135
 North Korea is a formal ally of China, but China stations three Group 
Armies (roughly 150,000 troops) and a border defense brigade near their 
880-mile shared border. 136 China maintains twenty-four-hour video and 
aerial drone surveillance of the border, has built bunkers there to protect 
Chinese forces against nuclear and chemical blasts, and has surged additional units to the border on several recent occasions, including in 2010 
when North Korea shelled South Korea’s Yeonpyeong Island; in 2013 after 
the purge of Jang Song Thaek, a high-ranking North Korean offi cial and 
uncle of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un; in August 2015 after an outbreak of hostilities between North and South Korea in the Korean demilitarized zone; and in 2017 when North Korea and the United States threatened 
each other with nuclear annihilation. 137
 Finally, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is engaged in a war on terror 
on its borders with Central Asian states, where Uighur separatists have 
established safe havens. China also has fl ooded the streets of Xinjiang with 
tens of thousands of paramilitary troops to enforce “grid-style social management” (aka martial law) on the population. 138
 All told, China probably spends several hundred billion dollars each year to 
secure its homeland. The United States, by contrast, enjoys low levels of internal unrest and is bordered by two weak neighbors, both of whom are U.S. 
allies. As a result, U.S. homeland security costs are less onerous than China’s. 
 Natural Capital 
 The key elements of natural capital are water, energy resources, and arable 
land, all of which are necessary to sustain life and power agriculture and 
industry. According to the UN, the United States has roughly 30 percent 
more natural capital than China, and both countries have been depleting 
their stocks over time. The World Bank, however, calculates that China has 
nearly three times the natural capital of the United States and suggests that 
both nations have been growing their stocks over time ( fi gure 3.16 ). 139
ECONOMIC TRENDS
57
 Which estimate is more accurate? Additional data suggests that the UN’s 
estimate is closer to the mark. According to the U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency, the United States has 10 percent more renewable freshwater than 
China ( fi gure 3.17 ); and analyses by the Council on Foreign Relations, The 
Economist, and independent researchers suggest that the actual gap is much 
larger, because half of China’s river water and 90 percent of its groundwater is 
unfi t to drink, and 25 percent of China’s river water and 60 percent of its 
groundwater is so polluted that the Chinese government has deemed it “unfi t 
for human contact” and unusable even for agriculture or industry. 140 China 
technically has 50,000 large rivers, but more than half of them have been 
destroyed through pollution, overuse, climate change, or all of the above. 141 
 In terms of energy resources, the United States has three times as much oil 
and natural gas as China and twice as much coal ( fi gure 3.17 ). China has subsidized its renewable energy and nuclear power industries, but both combined still account for less than 5 percent of China’s energy use compared to 
12 percent of the United States’. 142 China has large reserves of oil and natural 
gas encased in shale basins, but China has not been able to tap them and, 
according to some analyses, may never do so. 143 One reason is that China’s 
shale deposits were left behind by prehistoric lakes and, consequently, have 
rock layers that are more ductile and less amenable to hydraulic fracturing 
than the brittle marine shales in North America. 144 Another reason is that 
China lacks the water necessary for fracking. Each shale-gas well requires 
fi fteen thousand tons of water a year to run, and China would need to drill

near that amount of water located close to its major shale basins, which are 
concentrated in Jilin and Liaoning, two of China’s driest provinces. 145 
 Finally, the United States has 45 percent more arable land than China, and 
again the true size of the gap is probably much larger because large chunks of 
China’s farmland are too polluted, desiccated, or both to support agriculture. 
According to a recent Chinese government study, water pollution has 
destroyed nearly 20 percent of China’s arable land, an area the size of Belgium. 146 An additional 1 million square miles of China’s farmland has become 
desert, forcing the resettlement of 24,000 villages and pushing the edge of the 
Gobi Desert to within 150 miles of Beijing. 147 A recent study by Renmin University estimates that restoring China’s farmland would cost $1 trillion. 148 
 In sum, the United States has more water, energy resources, and arable 
land than China. The U.S. stock of natural capital, however, is larger than 
China’s not only because of the size of U.S. resource endowments, but also 
because the United States uses its resources more effi ciently and has fewer 
people to support with them. In other words, the United States has lower 
production and welfare costs. 
 production costs 
 The United States generates more than three times as much wealth from 
each gallon of water as China ( fi gure 3.18 ). China’s water use is extremely 
ineffi cient. In agriculture, only 45 percent of the water China withdraws 
actually makes it to crops, and in industry only 40 percent of water is

recycled, compared to 85 percent in the United States. 149 Geography further 
drags down the effi ciency of China’s water use: more than 80 percent of 
China’s water is located in the south, but half of China’s people and twothirds of its farms are in the North, so China is spending tens of billions of 
dollars to divert water from the Yangtze River in the south to the Yellow 
River in the north. 150
 The United States generates roughly 40 percent more wealth per unit of 
energy than China ( fi gure 3.18 ). China’s energy effi ciency has risen steadily 
since the 1970s, but it still lags behind that of the United States because China’s economy is dominated by heavy industries and manufacturing plants 
that consume vast amounts of energy to make low-profi t products. 151 
 Finally, American farmers produce 30 percent more food per hectare than 
Chinese farmers. Part of the U.S. agricultural advantage stems from better 
soil and more plentiful water. Another reason is that most of China’s farmers are poor peasants, roughly 40 percent of whom lack motorized equipment of any kind and have to plow and seed their fi elds using animals or 
their own muscle. 152
 welfare costs 
 With four times the population of the United States, China unsurprisingly consumes more water, energy, and land. In fact, China is the world’s 
most voracious consumer of all three resources. 153 Figure 3.14 , presented 
earlier, showed that China’s food consumption is increasing rapidly and 
has overtaken that of the United States. Figure 3.19 shows the same is true 
for water and energy.

 China’s resource consumption strains its limited supplies. China’s per 
capita availability of water is less than one-quarter of the United States’ and 
less than one-third the world’s average. The World Bank defi nes water scarcity as less than 1,000 cubic meters of fresh water per person per year. By 
that standard, roughly one-third of China’s provinces and two-thirds of its 
major cities suffer from water scarcity. 154 Beijing, for example, has roughly 
the same amount of water per person (145 cubic meters) as Saudi Arabia. 
Dealing with this scarcity, costs China roughly $140 billion per year in government expenditures and reduced productivity versus $12 billion for the 
United States. 155
 China already consumes 10 percent more energy than the United States 
and is expected to consume twice as much as America by 2040. 156 China 
currently depletes $400 billion of its energy resources per year and pays 
foreign countries another $500 billion in energy imports. U.S. annual depletion and net import costs, by contrast, are currently $140 billion and $120 
billion respectively. 
 Finally, China’s food consumption is outstripping the agricultural capacity of its land. In 2008, China became a net importer of grain, breaking its 
traditional policy of self-suffi ciency, and in 2011 China became the world’s 
largest importer of agricultural products. 157 Since then, China has increased 
its reliance on food imports, especially from the United States, which is China’s top supplier of agricultural products and earns roughly $25 billion per 
year by selling food to China. 158 China is trying to regain food selfsuffi ciency by heavily subsidizing farmers. As a consequence, however,

China is rapidly depleting its supply of agricultural land; according to an 
analysis by Xinhua, more than 40 percent of China’s arable land is suffering 
some form of “degradation” from overuse, including reduced fertility, erosion, changes in acidity, pollution, or all of the above. 159
 China’s economic growth over the past three decades has been spectacular, 
even miraculous. Yet the veneer of double-digit growth rates has masked 
gaping liabilities that impede China’s ability to close the wealth gap with 
the United States. China’s rapid growth in economic output can be explained 
almost entirely by rapid growth of inputs: hiring workers and spending 
money. China has achieved high growth at high costs, and the trends show 
that the costs are rising while growth is slowing. Accounting for these costs 
and trends reveals that the United States is several times wealthier than 
China, and the absolute gap is growing by trillions of dollars each year. 
 Nevertheless, wealth is only one pillar of global power. The other is military capability. History shows that China could threaten the United States 
militarily even as it lags behind economically. The Soviet Union, for example, never matched the United States in terms of aggregate wealth, yet it 
still managed to threaten U.S. primacy by raising a huge military that 
loomed over Central Europe. Could China do the same in East Asia? The 
next chapter considers this question. 
62
 chapter 4 
 Military Trends 
 Is China poised to dominate East Asia militarily? Will China eventually 
challenge the United States for global military supremacy? 
 Many studies address these questions, but most tally military assets (e.g. 
military spending, personnel, and weapons systems) while neglecting liabilities. This is a serious shortcoming, because the amount of military power 
a country can project abroad depends crucially on the strength and security 
of its home base. Two nations with identical militaries may, nevertheless, 
wield vastly different levels of military power if one country is surrounded 
by enemies and wracked by domestic instability whereas the other is stable 
and surrounded by allies. Assessments of the U.S.-China military balance, 
therefore, need to consider not only the assets each military has at its disposal but also the burdens each military is forced to bear. 
 This chapter provides such an assessment. The fi rst half examines each 
country’s net military resources. The second half assesses how each side 
would fare in the most likely scenarios for a U.S.-China war. My main fi nding is that the United States has fi ve to ten times the net military assets of 
China and maintains a formidable containment barrier against Chinese 
expansion in East Asia. 
 Defense Spending 
 The United States currently outspends China militarily three to one. Many 
analysts, however, expect that gap to shrink in the years ahead and some 
organizations, including The Economist and the International Institute for 
Strategic Studies, have projected that China’s defense budget will overtake 
America’s by the 2030s. 1
 There are many reasons to doubt such projections, not the least of 
which is that China’s economic growth is slowing dramatically, as 
shown in the previous chapter. Even if China’s defense spending eventually exceeds America’s, however, it would not necessarily mean that China 
MILITARY TRENDS
63
has more military resources. Defense spending statistics are gross flow 
measures that ignore accumulated stocks of military spending and fail 
to deduct welfare or security costs. As a result, such statistics vastly 
understate the U.S.-China military gap. Below, I elaborate on these 
points. 
 stocks versus flows 
 Since the 1950s, the United States has spent roughly half a trillion dollars 
every year on its military. 2
 As a result, the United States has amassed an 
arsenal of thousands of ships, aircraft, vehicles, satellites, R&D labs, radar 
installations, ammunition stockpiles, testing and training facilities, and 
bases. 3
 Many U.S. platforms built in the 1980s remain in service today, 
including hundreds of ships and thousands of aircraft that are as capable as 
China’s most advanced platforms. 
 Even discounting these Cold War-era assets, the U.S.-China gap in 
military stocks is large and growing, because the United States outspends China every year. Figure 4.1 shows U.S. and Chinese accumulated defense spending since 2000 (not including U.S. appropriations for 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) and makes clear that China would 
need to outspend the United States by substantial margins in the decades 
ahead just to start closing the gap in recently accumulated military 
capital.

 welfare costs 
 A second reason military spending data understate the U.S.-China gap is 
that welfare costs consume at least 34 percent of China’s military budget 
versus 27 percent of the United States’. Chinese troops are cheaper than 
U.S. personnel on a per soldier basis—because they receive less equipment, 
lower wages, and fewer benefi ts than their U.S. counterparts 4
 —but China 
employs 1.2 million more troops than the United States and thus has many 
more pensions and salaries to pay and food, medical care, training and 
housing to provide. 5
 The fi gures above probably understate China’s true military welfare 
costs, because China’s numbers only include personnel costs whereas the 
U.S. fi gures include personnel costs plus military construction costs. 6
 Moreover, China’s numbers do not include spending on the 8 million troops in 
the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Militia, which handles the PLA’s 
logistics and rear area security missions. 7
 Nor do China’s numbers account 
for the dramatic rise in Chinese wages over the past two decades. In 2006, 
for example, the PLA doubled troops’ salaries, but the Chinese government 
reported, incredibly, that personnel costs did not increase. Independent 
estimates suggest that rising personnel costs actually are “an enormous 
burden on [China’s] defense budget” and have consumed more than half of 
the increases in China’s military budget since 2005. 8
 security costs 
 As noted in chapter 3, China suffers from more domestic unrest than the 
United States and is surrounded by hostile countries whereas the United 
States is bordered by two allies and two oceans. As a result, security costs 
drain more of China’s military budget than America’s. 
 At least 20 percent of the PLA’s budget—as reported by the most popular public source of data, the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute—actually funds the People’s Armed Police (PAP), an internal 
security force charged with domestic missions that are performed by civilian agencies in the United States. 9
 Moreover, the PLA itself regularly 
expends resources on internal security. 10 For example, in 2008 the PLA 
rolled into Tibet to put down mass riots, and in 2009 PLA forces imposed 
martial law in Xinjiang. 
 In addition to internal security, the PLA must secure China’s land borders, which stretch fourteen thousand miles and include boundaries with 
fi fteen countries. 11 As described in chapter 3, some of these borders remain 
confl ict zones today, and all of them require full-time border defense forces 
that collectively consume more than 15 percent of the PLA’s budget. 12 All 
told, then, at least 35 percent of China’s military budget goes to homeland 
security operations: 20 percent for the PAP and an additional 15 percent for 
border defense troops ( fi gure 4.2 ). 13
MILITARY TRENDS
65
 Whereas the PLA is bogged down at home, the U.S. military focuses on 
power projection abroad. The U.S. military does not maintain a paramilitary 
force equivalent to the PAP and is barred by law (the Posse Comitatus Act of 
1878) from conducting internal security missions. State governments occasionally call on the National Guard—a military reserve of part-time “citizensoldiers”—to help local police contain protests, secure infrastructure (e.g., 
airports), or provide disaster relief. But these homeland deployments are 
funded by state budgets, not the U.S. military budget. They therefore do not 
need to be deducted from U.S. military spending statistics the way PAP 
funding should be deducted from Chinese military spending data. 
 Border defense missions also take little fi nancial toll on the U.S. military. 
No country claims any U.S. territory, and civilian agencies (mainly the 
Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
the National Security Agency) run and fund border patrol and domestic 
counterterrorism operations. In addition, the Department of Energy pays 
most of the costs of maintaining the U.S. nuclear arsenal, so the only homeland security mission funded primarily by the U.S. military is national missile defense, which consumes less than 1 percent of the U.S. military budget. 
 The U.S. military conducts expensive counterterrorism missions abroad, 
but the direct costs of these missions, which include the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, have been paid out of a separate congressional slush fund 
called the Overseas Contingency Operations budget. 14 The long-term costs 
(e.g., the cost of medical care and disability compensation for veterans and 
their families) have been paid primarily by the Department of Veterans

Affairs and private charities. 15 Obviously the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan 
have taken an enormous economic and social toll on the United States—the 
wars cost $5 trillion and killed nearly seven thousand U.S. soldiers and 
wounded more than fi fty thousand—but they are not hidden costs that 
need to be subtracted from U.S. military spending statistics. 16
 Personnel 
 China has the world’s largest military and fi elds 1.2 million more troops 
than the United States. Extra manpower, however, does not necessarily 
give China a military advantage. As explained earlier, employing millions 
of troops generates welfare costs that deplete funds for weapons and operations. Moreover, as I will show below, PLA personnel are less skilled than 
U.S. military personnel on average, and nearly half of the PLA’s personnel 
are tied down by homeland security missions. 
 production costs 
 To survive on a modern battlefi eld, military units need to be stealthy and 
nimble, attributes that require tremendous skill. 17 In previous centuries, 
populous countries could win wars by sending hordes of untrained conscripts to overwhelm opponents. Today, however, mass armies are sitting 
ducks, because a single precision-guided missile can wipe out a whole 
company of troops or sink a large warship. A country’s military power, 
therefore, depends not just on the size of its ranks, but also on the skill of its 
soldiers, which can be assessed by four main factors: education, combat 
experience, training, and leadership. 
 Education. The PLA has nearly caught up to the United States in terms 
of the educational attainment of its personnel. 18 In 2000, half of the PLA 
had only a middle school education. By 2010, however, 88 percent of China’s troops had attended high school and 20 percent had a four-year college degree—a percentage not far below that of U.S. military personnel 
(28 percent). 
 Combat Experience. The PLA, however, lacks combat experience. 
Whereas the United States has been the most militarily active country in 
the world since 1945, China has not fought a war since 1979 (a short border 
war against Vietnam involving only the army) and has conducted only one 
joint combat campaign in its history (the 1955 amphibious landing to 
capture Yijiangshan Island from Kuomintang forces). Both operations 
resulted in heavy PLA casualties. At present, essentially none of China’s 
troops has ever been in combat. Chinese analysts call this problem “peace 
MILITARY TRENDS
67
disease” and fret that PLA troops lack the valor ( xuexing ) necessary to win 
a war. 19 
 China has sent roughly sixteen thousand troops on UN peacekeeping 
missions, and Chinese forces participate in multinational antipiracy missions in the western Indian Ocean. These deployments, however, have 
involved less than 1 percent of China’s military and are a poor substitute 
for actual combat experience. 20
 Training. PLA training has improved dramatically since the 1990s, when 
most exercises were simple drills conducted under benign conditions. 
Today, Chinese units train against dynamic enemy “blue teams” on unfamiliar terrain, at night, in bad weather, and under hostile electronic warfare 
and cyber warfare conditions. 21
 Yet PLA exercises remain heavily scripted (the red team almost always 
wins) and most focus on nonwar operations, such as border control, counterterrorism, and counterpiracy, rather than high-intensity combat. 22 Most 
exercises involve a single service or branch, so troops lack the ability to 
conduct joint operations, and assessments are often nothing more than 
“subjective judgments based on visual observation rather than on detailed 
quantitative data” and are scored “based simply on whether a training program has been implemented rather than on whether the goals of the program have been achieved.” 23
 PLA exercises also tend to be infrequent and small in scale. The PLA’s 
Rocket Force, for example, has never fi red more than ten ballistic missiles 
simultaneously during an exercise. 24 In wartime, however, the Rocket 
Force might need to fi re hundreds or even thousands of missiles rapidly, a 
much more daunting task. Chinese pilots fl y 100 to 150 fewer hours than 
U.S. pilots 25 and only began training on aircraft carriers in 2012 whereas 
the U.S. military has operated carriers since the 1920s. 26 Chinese troops 
spend 20 to 30 percent of their time studying communist ideology and 
attending political meetings, and some units at the brigade and regimental level farm to feed themselves. 27 Ninety percent of recent PLA air 
defense exercises were scripted while only 6 percent involved combinedarms and less than 1 percent involved joint exercises with another service. 28 And a recent study of China’s submarine force fi nds that “only a 
small percentage of China’s submariners benefi t from deployments in 
which they might encounter a future adversary. The overall force’s ability 
to fi nd and destroy warships in the open ocean with torpedoes remains an 
open question.” 29 
 American military training methods, by contrast, are widely considered the 
best in the world. For example, a major study comparing U.S. training programs to those of China, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, and India fi nds 
that “the U.S. training system is the envy of the countries we examined, and 
they attempt to emulate many U.S. best practices.” 30 The same study concludes 
CHAPTER 4
68
that the “PLA undoubtedly falls well short of U.S. standards” in all aspects of 
training, including jointness, realism, complexity, and evaluation. 31 
 Leadership. Successfully coordinating, supplying, and transporting forces 
in battle requires not just trained soldiers but also talented offi cers and 
brainy analysts. 32 Basic training for a typical soldier takes months, but grooming offi cers to lead them takes years and requires a system of military academies to disseminate know-how and breed trust within the ranks. An 
effective military administration also requires a robust network of research 
institutions and scholars to staff them. 
 The PLA lags behind the U.S. military in all of these areas. Chinese military 
academies are poorly staffed—only 15 percent of instructors have advanced 
degrees versus 90 percent of instructors in U.S. military academies 33 —and 
China has only three of the world’s top one hundred military research institutes whereas the United States has twenty-fi ve. 34 
 More important, recent internal investigations found that the PLA “is 
riddled with corruption and professional decay, compromised by ties of 
patronage, and asphyxiated by the ever-greater effort required to impose 
political control.” 35 According to U.S. intelligence assessments, “the level 
of corruption in the PLA at least equals, and probably far exceeds, the 
level of corruption in the civilian economy.” 36 If the same is true for the 
United States, then the PLA is at least twice as corrupt as the U.S. military. 37 Hundreds of senior PLA offi cers have reportedly purchased their 
positions by paying bribes to superiors, and more than four thousand 
offi cers at the rank of lieutenant colonel or above, including eighty-two 
generals, have been investigated for corruption since 2010. 38 
 The PLA is not just corrupt but also intensely political. From company 
level to the top brass, decision making is split between military offi cers and 
political commissars, the latter of whom enforce loyalty to the Communist 
Party by obliging troops to engage in fi fteen hours of “political work” each 
week. 39 The U.S. military, by contrast, stresses “unity of command” in 
which all forces operate under a single leader, and for good reason: political 
commissars not only drain valuable resources, but also impede quick decision making in battle. 40
 security costs 
 As noted earlier, China suffers from a high level of domestic unrest and is 
surrounded by hostile neighbors. Dealing with these threats is labor intensive. 
Consequently, the PLA devotes more than 1 million troops (roughly 45 percent of the active-duty force) to internal security and border defense: 660,000 
troops in the PAP, 128,000 troops in border defense units, and 239,500 ground 
troops based near major cities in border regions. 41 Thus nearly half of China’s 
military personnel are focused on missions at home rather than abroad. 42 
MILITARY TRENDS
69
 American military personnel, by contrast, focus on missions abroad, because 
civilian agencies handle border patrol and internal security. Despite employing 1.2 million more personnel than the U.S. military, therefore, the PLA has 
around the same number of personnel available for a war with the United 
States: the PLA Air Force has 398,000 personnel whereas the U.S. Air Force 
has 312,453; the PLA navy has 235,000 personnel versus 321,599 in the U.S. 
Navy; and the PLA Army has 572,500 troops outside of its border defense 
units versus 504,330 troops in the U.S. Army and 187,891 in the Marines. 43 
 Platforms and Munitions 
 The United States remains the only country with the bases, long-range platforms, and global intelligence and surveillance systems necessary to be a 
decisive military player in any region. China is nowhere close to achieving 
this capability. Figure 4.3 makes this point clear and actually understates 
the U.S.-China power-projection gap, because many U.S. platforms are two 
to three times as capable as China’s.

 For example, U.S. aircraft carriers are 50 percent faster and hold twice as 
many aircraft as China’s carriers, and fi ghters launched from U.S. carriers 
can carry 40 percent more ammunition and fuel than fi ghters taking off 
from China’s, because U.S. carriers hurl aircraft into the sky with catapults 
whereas China’s carriers require aircraft to propel themselves off a ramp at 
the bow of the ship. 44 Furthermore, the endurance of China’s carriers is limited by their steam-powered engines, which need to be refueled and refurbished many times a year. American carriers, by contrast, are powered by 
nuclear reactors that only need to be replaced once during a carrier’s fi ftyyear service life. For all these reasons, military experts generally agree that 
China’s carriers are incapable of high-intensity combat, even within waters 
close to China’s shores. 45
 China’s nine nuclear-powered submarines (four strategic, fi ve tactical) 
carry less than half the munitions of current U.S. submarines and are louder 
than U.S. submarines from the 1960s. 46 Consequently, the U.S. Navy, which 
operates a sound surveillance system in the waters of East Asia, can track 
China’s nuclear-powered submarines at long ranges. 47 China is developing 
its own sound surveillance system, but even when it becomes operational 
(the United States spent forty years developing its system) the PLA will 
have diffi culty tracking U.S. submarines, which are so quiet that they sometimes reduce background noise as they pass by a target. 48 China’s fi fty-seven 
diesel-powered submarines are very quiet when running on their electric 
batteries, but they sail at half the speed and have half the endurance of U.S. 
nuclear-powered submarines, so they rarely leave China’s near seas. 49 
 American destroyers and cruisers carry 40 to 60 percent more munitions 
than China’s large surface combatants and are equipped with radars and 
data systems that are at least a generation ahead of China’s. 50 The United 
States is set to equip its ships and submarines with an antiship version of 
the Tomahawk cruise missile, which can strike targets a thousand miles 
away. 51 By contrast, China’s most advanced sea-launched antiship missile, 
the YJ-18, is rumored to have a range between 130 and 330 miles. 52
 The United States operates hundreds of stealth fi fth-generation fi ghter 
aircraft; China operates none and probably will not do so for at least a 
decade. 53 China’s new aerial refueling tankers, IL-78s purchased from 
Ukraine, deliver half the fuel of U.S. KC-10s and have 30 percent shorter 
range. China’s latest heavy drone, the Caihong 5, resembles U.S. Reaper 
drones, but carries half the payload and lacks the sophisticated sensors on 
U.S. drones. 54
 China’s largest transport aircraft, the Y-20, carries half as much weight 
and has half the range of American C-5 aircraft. China’s most advanced 
amphibious ship, the Type 071, carries 30 percent as many troops, vehicles, 
and aircraft as U.S. Wasp-class amphibious assault ships and is armed only 
with machine guns whereas U.S. amphibious ships have guns, cannons, 
missiles, and missile defense systems. China’s new long-range bomber, the 
MILITARY TRENDS
71
H-6K, has only 40 percent of the unrefueled range and 30 percent of the 
payload capacity of American B-52 bombers; only 20 percent of the range 
and 30 percent of the payload of U.S. B-1 bombers; and half the range and 
payload and none of the stealth of American B-2 bombers. 
 China has an active cyber warfare unit, but data gathered by the Economist Intelligence Unit, some of which is aggregated in fi gure 4.3, suggest 
that the United States leads China by every indicator of cyber power, 
including the level of government commitment to cyber security and cyber 
warfare, the number and depth of public/private partnerships (e.g. cooperation between government security services and private companies), the 
number of secure servers, the level of funding for cyber warfare and security, the technical skills of the cyber security workforce, and the overall 
quality of information and communications technology. 55 Qualitative studies reach similar conclusions. 56
 Area-Denial within 500 Miles of China 
 The United States dominates China militarily at the global level. Within 
East Asia, however, the military balance is more evenly matched for two 
main reasons. 
 First, geography limits U.S. combat power. 57 American forces are scattered around the globe, and the U.S. military is vulnerable when it operates 
near enemy coastlines, where it is within range of enemy antiship missiles 
and tactical aircraft; in air operations below fi fteen thousand feet, where 
enemy antiaircraft weaponry becomes more lethal; and in naval operations 
in shallow waters, where enemy ships are harder to detect. 58 A U.S.-China 
war would probably take place in such a “contested zone.” In fact, the PLA 
is counting on it. 
 Second, the current state of technology bolsters China’s home-fi eld advantage. In past eras, China would have had to fi ght the U.S. military symmetrically by sending battleships to blast away at America’s fl eet, a head-to-head 
contest that China would almost surely lose. Today, by contrast, China can 
fend off the U.S. military asymmetrically, by conducting cyber attacks and 
launching precision-guided munitions from a variety of cheap platforms 
(e.g. trucks and small ships) based on or near China’s territory. 
 The average cost of these so-called antiaccess/area-denial (A2/AD) 
capabilities is about one-fi ftieth of the cost of the power-projection capabilities they could destroy in war. 59 Thus, even though the United States has 
outspent China militarily by more than $7 trillion since 2000 (not including 
spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan), many defense analysts 
believe that China can now temporarily deny the U.S. military air and sea 
control near Chinese territory, something China was previously incapable 
of doing. 60 Below, I elaborate on these points. 
CHAPTER 4
72
 air denial 
 China would enjoy several advantages over the U.S. military in an air 
war within several hundred miles of China’s coastline. First, China would 
be able to commit its entire air force to the battle, including more than one 
thousand fourth-generation fi ghter aircraft operating from more than two 
hundred air bases on mainland China. The United States, by contrast, only 
has nine air bases in East Asia and might have only a few hundred aircraft 
available on the fi rst day of a war there. 
 Second, China’s air forces would be protected by covering fi re from 
ground-based air defenses. 61 American aircraft, by contrast, would have to 
fend for themselves, and might not even make it off the ground, because 
China has several hundred medium-range ballistic missiles (DH-21Cs) and 
land-attack cruise missiles that could strike U.S. air bases in Japan, South 
Korea, and the Philippines. 62 China also is developing an antiship ballistic 
missile that could potentially strike U.S. aircraft carriers thousands of miles 
away, though it is not clear the PLA can master the targeting capabilities 
needed to guide such a missile to a moving ship. 63
 To counter China’s capabilities, the United States has deployed hundreds 
of stealth aircraft and dozens of submarines armed with “standoff” missiles 
that can be fi red from beyond the range of China’s air defenses, 64 acquired 
new electronic warfare capabilities to help nonstealth aircraft evade and 
degrade Chinese air defenses, 65 and dispersed its base structure in Asia by 
gaining access to two bases in Australia and fi ve in the Philippines and 
allocating funds to build new airstrips on several small Pacifi c islands. 66
 China conceivably could disable U.S. air bases in Japan, South Korea, and 
the northern Philippines with a surprise air and missile attack. Should 
China pull off such an attack, U.S. air forces would have to operate from 
aircraft carriers and runways on and around Guam, which is 1,800 miles 
from China, and be refueled enroute to the combat zone. This extra distance 
would cut the number of U.S. air sorties in half and potentially enable 
China to establish air superiority over a concentrated area near its territory, 
such as over the Taiwan Strait. 67
 The United States could fi ght its way back into the combat theater, but 
doing so would be costly. The RAND Corporation calculates that in a worstcase scenario—a war over Taiwan in which the PLA destroys U.S. air bases 
in Japan in a surprise attack, and Taiwan does nothing in its own defense—
the United States could lose seventy-eight aircraft in the process of winning 
back command of the skies over Taiwan. 68
 The above scenario, however, assumes not only that Taiwan does not 
defend itself but also that the United States refrains from attacking Chinese air 
bases. In reality, if China attacked U.S. bases, the U.S. military would almost 
certainly retaliate by cratering the runways at Chinese air bases. Computer 
simulations show that one week of U.S. air attacks, supplemented by 200 
MILITARY TRENDS
73
Tomahawk missiles launched from two Ohio-class submarines, could disable 
30 to 45 percent of China’s air bases near Taiwan or all of the air bases near the 
South China Sea, and destroy 90 percent of the aircraft parked at these bases, 
while losing few if any U.S. aircraft and no ships or submarines. 69 
 Thus, the United States can still “win” an air war against China with no 
help from allies, but it might lose dozens of aircraft in air-to-air combat and 
potentially many more on the ground if China attacks U.S. air bases. For 
most countries, losing a few air bases and less than 1 percent of its combat 
aircraft (the U.S. military has roughly three thousand fi ghter aircraft) would 
be a small price to pay to win an air war against a major power. For the 
United States in the post–Cold War period, however, such losses would be 
unprecedented. 
 sea denial 
 Since the 1990s, China has signfi cantly increased its ability to attack U.S. 
surface ships within fi ve hundred miles of Chinese territory. Most notable, 
China has upgraded its attack submarine fl eet, adding four new nuclearpowered submarines and dozens of diesel-powered submarines with airindependent propulsion systems that can stay submerged for a week at a 
time (other diesel-powered submarines have to surface every few days to 
take in oxygen and recharge their batteries). 70 China soon will equip most 
of its attack submarines with the YJ-18 cruise missile, which may be able to 
strike targets up to 330 miles away. 
 China also has twenty-one destroyers, fi fty-four frigates, and dozens of 
coastal patrol craft armed with advanced antiship missiles. 71 China’s frigates 
and patrol craft lack the missile defense systems and endurance of U.S. 
destroyers and cruisers, but China could send swarms of them to overwhelm 
U.S. surface combatants. 72 China’s destroyers carry roughly half the armaments of U.S. destroyers, and less than half the arms of U.S. cruisers, but in 
combat near China they could return to base frequently to reload whereas 
U.S. ships would have to do so at vulnerable bases in Japan or in faraway 
Guam or Hawaii (currently, the U.S. Navy cannot reload its ships at sea). 
 In addition, China can fi re antiship missiles from shore-based batteries 
and from its 50 H-6K bombers, each of which has a combat radius of 2,000 
miles and can carry 6 YJ-12 antiship cruise missiles with a range of 250 
miles. China also has 100 older H-6H/M and H-6G bombers, each of which 
can carry 2 to 4 long-range antiship cruise missiles. 
 Finally, China has fi fty thousand sea mines. 73 Although the PLA only has 
one dedicated mine-laying ship, which can lay three hundred mines at a 
time, China’s ships, submarines, and bomber aircraft can each lay several 
dozen mines. 74 In a war over Taiwan, China would probably mine the 
entrances to the Taiwan Strait, and in any confl ict involving the United States, 
the PLA might try to mine U.S. naval bases in Japan and Guam. 75 Historically, 
CHAPTER 4
74
mine warfare has been a highly effective tactic: in the Korean War, North 
Korea sunk several U.S. ships and prevented U.S. forces from landing effi -
ciently at Wonsan by mining its own waters; and during the Persian Gulf 
War, Iraqi mines knocked two U.S. ships out of the war and forced the U.S. 
military to abort an amphibious assault. 76 The PLA has studied these cases 
carefully and made mine warfare a core tenet of its naval doctrine. 77 
 In sum, China’s ability to attack the U.S. surface fl eet has improved dramatically since 1990s, when U.S. ships could approach China’s coast with 
virtual impunity. Computer simulations suggest that China’s submarines 
would have a 50 percent chance of fi nding a U.S. aircraft carrier in waters 
within a thousand nautical miles of Taiwan in a seven-day campaign; and if 
China develops the radar and satellite infrastructure necessary to guide 
antiship ballistic missile to targets, it will be able to hold at risk any U.S. 
ship within nine hundred miles of China’s coast. 78
 The U.S. military, however, can sink Chinese ships and submarines virtually anywhere in East Asia. The main reason is that the United States has 
dozens of missile-armed submarines that are almost invulnerable to China’s 
notoriously weak antisubmarine capabilities. 79 In wartime, U.S. submarines, 
with the aid of America’s vast undersea surveillance network in East Asia, 80
could set up picket lines near the combat theater, or near China’s ports, and 
sink China’s ships and submarines with torpedoes, missiles, and mines. 
According to estimates by the RAND Corporation, in a PLA invasion of Taiwan, eight U.S. submarines could destroy almost 40 percent of China’s 
amphibious ships as they attempt to cross the Taiwan Strait while losing perhaps one submarine. 81 The same study estimates that in a confl ict in the South 
China Sea—where the sea is deeper and provides U.S. submarines with better acoustics and more room to operate, and where most of the PLA’s meager 
antisubmarine warfare forces cannot reach—U.S. submarines could destroy 
Chinese ships at almost no risk of being attacked themselves. 82 
 In addition to upgrading its submarine force, 83 the United States has outfi tted its surface ships with the advanced Undersea Warfare Combat System 
(the AN/SQQ-89), which tracks enemy submarines with active and passive 
sonar data collected from hull-mounted and towed arrays and sonobuoys. 84
The U.S. military also is replacing most of its P-3C Orion submarine hunter 
aircraft with the P-8A Poseidon—a Boeing 737 packed with missiles, torpedoes, mines, drones, and depth charges—which can sweep an area of 1,400 
miles for enemy submarines. The navy will soon equip its 30 P-8As with the 
High-Altitude Antisubmarine Warfare Weapon, a powerful torpedo attached 
to a miniature jet and glider that can be fi red from altitudes of thirty thousand feet at targets nearly a hundred miles away. 85 The navy also will soon 
deploy MC-4C high-altitude drones that can scan seas for enemy submarines for thirty hours at a time and direct the P-8As to targets. 86 
 The U.S. Navy remains vulnerable to Chinese mines; the current U.S. mine 
countermeasures force consists of 13 wooden Avenger-class minesweepers, 
MILITARY TRENDS
75
28 MH-53E helicopters, and a small team of divers and mine-sniffi ng dolphins and sea lions. These forces clear mines one-by-one by attaching explosives to mines or shooting them with sniper rifl es and would obviously be 
overwhelmed by a serious mine warfare campaign. To upgrade these forces, 
the U.S. Navy has procured 40 Littoral Combat Ships (stealthy surface combatants that can sail at 45 knots), 32 of which will carry a modern Mine Countermeasures Mission Package that detects mines with sonar and lasers and 
destroys them with torpedo-fi ring drones. In 2016, the United States procured additional Archerfi sh drones that can detect and detonate sea mines 
and be deployed by aircraft, ships, and submarines. 87 
 Meanwhile, the United States has revived its own mine warfare capabilities by developing Quickstrike mines that can be deployed rapidly from a 
variety of combat aircraft and glide toward target areas forty-fi ve miles 
away. 88 Given that China has no mine countermeasures aircraft and only four 
large mine countermeasures ships (China has forty-four small harbor craft 
based on 1950s Soviet designs), a U.S. mine warfare campaign would wreak 
havoc on Chinese naval operations. 89 The U.S. military could mine China’s 
naval bases at Zhanjiang, Ningbo, and Qingdao as well as the PLA submarine base on Hainan Island. And if China tries to invade Taiwan, U.S. aircraft 
could mine the origin and landing points of PLA amphibious transports. 
 net assessment 
 The seas and skies within 500 miles of China constitute a contested zone 
where both the United States and China can threaten to sink each other’s 
surface ships and shoot down each other’s nonstealth aircraft. 90 This situation is a major change from the 1990s when the U.S. military could cruise 
along China’s coastline virtually risk free. 
 Many American analysts fear that China could use its burgeoning A2/
AD capabilities to hold the U.S. military at bay while conquering parts of 
East Asia. 91 Left unchecked, some analysts fear, China will eventually 
become the hegemon of East Asia and start projecting military power into 
other regions, including the Western Hemisphere. 92
 Below, however, I argue that China cannot impose regional hegemony 
nor achieve more limited aims, like conquering Taiwan or enforcing territorial claims in the East and South China Seas. One reason, as described 
above, is that the U.S. military maintains a massive arsenal in East Asia. 
Another reason is that China’s neighbors have developed their own A2/
AD capabilities, which can deny China sea and air control throughout most 
of its near seas—even without U.S. assistance. In other words, China’s 
neighbors have imposed security costs on China that have partially offset 
China’s military enhancements over the past two decades. 93 Below, I 
describe this East Asian balance of power and explain how the United 
States can reinforce it. 
CHAPTER 4
76
 Regional Maritime Hegemony 
 Is China poised to take over East Asia militarily? In the past 150 years, only 
two nations have succeeded in establishing regional maritime hegemony: 
Japan in the 1930s and early 1940s, and the United States from the 1890s to 
the present. The U.S. and Japanese cases suggest that China would need 
two things to enforce its own version of the Monroe Doctrine in East Asia: a 
regional monopoly of naval power and a military presence on the landmasses surrounding the East and South China Seas. China, however, is 
nowhere close to achieving either of those objectives. 
 First, when the United States and Imperial Japan took control of their 
near seas, their navies accounted for 80 to 99 percent of the naval tonnage in 
their respective regions. 94 China’s navy today, by contrast, accounts for less 
than 30 percent of Asia’s naval tonnage and, as fi gure 4.4 shows, China’s 
maritime neighbors have collectively matched China’s procurement of 
modern submarines, ships, and aircraft over the past two decades. China’s 
navy may be the most powerful in Asia, but it is no police power. 
 Second, the United States and Imperial Japan occupied the landmasses 
around their near seas and barred neighboring states from building

independent navies. At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States 
annexed Puerto Rico; turned Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Nicaragua into U.S. protectorates; and periodically occupied 
Veracruz, Mexico’s only port on the Gulf of Mexico. 95 Today, the U.S. military operates from facilities in Cuba, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, 
Curacao, Aruba, Antigua, the Bahamas, Panama, and Puerto Rico. 96 Imperial Japan’s coastal empire was even more extensive, including present-day 
Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Burma, most of China’s east coast, and numerous islands 
in the Pacifi c Ocean. 97
 China today has no prospect of controlling the coasts of East Asia. China’s 
maritime neighbors are densely populated and possess modern militaries, and 
amphibious invasions have become extremely diffi cult, if not impossible, in an 
age of precision-guided munitions, a point I elaborate on later ( fi gure 4.5 ).

CHAPTER 4

 Given these obstacles to outright conquest, China has sought to expand 
on the sly via a “cabbage strategy,” in which it wraps disputed waters in 
layers of coast guard, maritime militia, and fi shing vessels—all backed by 
warships loitering just over the horizon. 98 This tactic, however, is unlikely 
to enable China to command maritime East Asia. 
 One reason is that China’s neighbors have bolstered their own coast 
guard forces ( fi gure 4.4 ). China’s fl eet remains the largest in Asia, but it is 
spread thin defending China’s expansive claims, which encompass an area 
of nearly 2 million square miles. China’s neighbors, by contrast, concentrate their fl eets around their more limited claims. 
 More important, China’s neighbors have shown that they are willing to 
use military force against China’s civilian vessels. Indonesia and Malaysia, 
for example, announced in 2016 that they would sink foreign vessels that 
fi sh or drill in their claimed waters in the South China Sea, and Indonesia 
made good on this promise at least three times in 2016, fi ring on Chinese 
fi shing vessels and blowing them up on national TV—all while Chinese 
coast guard cutters watched from a distance. 99
 In sum, China is not poised to overrun maritime East Asia. In the following sections, therefore, I analyze whether China could accomplish more 
limited objectives, including conquering Taiwan or enforcing its territorial 
claims in the East or South China Seas. 
 Conquering Taiwan 
 Of all the nations impeding China’s military rise, none is more important 
than Taiwan. Conquering Taiwan is the PLA’s primary war-fi ghting mission, and preparations for this campaign consume roughly one-third of 
China’s defense budget. 100 If China conquered Taiwan, it would free up 
dozens of ships, hundreds of missile launchers and combat aircraft, thousands of personnel, and billions of dollars. Moreover, China could use 
Taiwan as an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” to project military power into the 
Western Pacifi c and to impose blockades on Japan and the Philippines. 
Most important, China would end the Chinese civil war once and for all 
and eliminate the world’s only Chinese democracy, thereby bolstering the 
Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy. 
 For all these reasons, many strategists consider Taiwan to be a center of 
gravity in East Asia: in Taiwanese hands, the island is a defensive cork bottling up Chinese expansion; in Chinese hands, Taiwan could become a 
launching pad for Chinese aggression. 101
 A war over Taiwan could take several forms. China could try to invade 
and occupy Taiwan outright. Alternatively, China could try to coerce Taiwan into submission by strangling Taiwan’s economy with a blockade or 
bombing Taiwan’s cities. Later, I discuss all three options. 
MILITARY TRENDS
79
 First, however, I discuss whether China could destroy Taiwan’s air, naval, 
and missile forces in a surprise attack. Such an attack would enable China 
to establish air superiority over and sea control around Taiwan—two crucial ingredients, if not outright prerequisites, for a successful invasion, 
blockade, or strategic bombing campaign. 
 surprise air and missile strikes 
 According to PLA strategy documents, China would initiate a war with 
Taiwan by bombarding its air and naval bases, missile batteries, and command centers with salvos of ground- and air-launched missiles. 102 The goal 
would be to destroy most of Taiwan’s air defenses and offensive forces 
before they have a chance to fi ght back. 
 This tactic would constitute China’s only hope of establishing air and 
sea command in the Taiwan Strait, which in turn would be vital to a successful invasion, blockade, or strategic bombing campaign. If Taiwan 
retained substantial missile forces, a Chinese amphibious invasion would 
be impossible, because Taiwan could pick off PLA landing craft as they 
motored across the Taiwan Strait. Similarly, a sustained bombing campaign would be impossible, because Taiwan’s air force and air defenses 
could decimate China’s bombers. A submarine blockade might be possible even without air and sea dominance, but it would be diffi cult to sustain if Taiwan can attack the blockade force. The bottom line is that 
conquering a developed island nation is diffi cult, so China would probably need to destroy most of Taiwan’s military in the fi rst few days of a war 
to prevail. 
 What are China’s prospects? In 2000, the PLA had only a few hundred 
inaccurate missiles and a few dozen advanced aircraft and clearly could not 
carry out a disarming fi rst strike. 103 Today, however, China has fi fteen hundred accurate missiles pointed at Taiwan and more than a thousand 
advanced fi ghter aircraft. 104 If China catches Taiwan off-guard—with its 
missile batteries, aircraft, and ships parked in the open—China potentially 
could wipe out Taiwan’s long-range air defenses, temporarily ground Taiwan’s air force, and sink Taiwan’s large naval ships. 105
 The above scenario presupposes Taiwan had no advanced knowledge of 
the Chinese attack. In reality, Taiwan probably would have some notice, 
because it has one of the best early warning systems in the world, consisting of at least twenty fi xed early warning radars; ten ground-mobile radars; 
six E-2 Hawkeye aircraft; thousands of spies embedded on the mainland; 
and satellite and aircraft intelligence provided by the United States. 106 Historically, Taiwanese intelligence has provided advanced warning of PLA 
actions. For example, in 2013 spies forewarned the Taiwanese government 
about China’s decision to announce an air defense identifi cation zone in the 
East China Sea. 107 If China planned an all-out assault on Taiwan—an 
CHAPTER 4
80
operation that would involve tens of thousands of personnel—the Taiwanese military would probably catch wind of it. 
 If Taiwan detected an impending PLA attack, it would quickly deploy its 
navy and disperse its combat aircraft among thirty-six airfi elds scattered 
around the island. Some of these locations have aircraft hangars built inside 
of mountains. Others have aircraft shelters with six-foot thick concrete 
walls. 108 If PLA missiles cratered the runways at Taiwan’s air bases, Taiwanese aircraft could operate from ten civilian airstrips and fi ve highways that 
double as emergency air bases, all of which have fuel and supplies prepositioned for the air force. 109 Meanwhile Taiwan’s runway repair teams, which 
currently hold the world speed record for runway repair (three hours), 
would start patching the tarmac at the main air bases. 110
 Taiwan also would try to shoot down Chinese missiles and aircraft and 
perhaps strike Chinese bases and missile batteries. For air defense, Taiwan 
has 524 long-range surface-to-air missile launchers, 80 percent of which are 
road-mobile; thousands of short-range surface-to-air missile launchers 
mounted to vehicles or carried by ground troops; and 400 road-mobile antiaircraft guns. 111 For offensive strike, Taiwan has at least 12 road-mobile 
cruise missile launchers; 50 short-range ballistic missile launchers in underground silos; 300 howitzers located on offshore islands (Jinmen, Mazu) just 
a few miles from the Chinese mainland; roughly 400 fi ghter aircraft, 73 
ships, and 2 submarines that can fi re long-range cruise missiles; and several 
thousand special operations troops embedded on the mainland that could 
blitz Chinese bases. 112
 History suggests that some of Taiwan’s major weapons systems would 
survive a Chinese surprise attack. In the Gulf War, for example, the U.S.-led 
coalition pummeled Iraq with 88,500 tons of ordnance and shredded Iraq’s 
airfi elds with cluster bombs, yet most of Iraq’s air force and all of Iraq’s 
road-mobile missile launchers survived and fought on. 113 In 1999, NATO 
pounded Serbian air defenses in Kosovo for 78 days with 7,000 tons of ordnance, but only destroyed 3 of Serbia’s 22 mobile missile batteries. 114
 Given that China’s short-range ballistic missiles could only deliver 700 
total tons of ordnance on Taiwan—not to mention that Taiwan’s air defenses 
and strike platforms are more numerous, mobile, and advanced than Iraq’s 
or Serbia’s were—China would have even more trouble than the United 
States did in Iraq and Kosovo in disarming its adversary with air and missile 
strikes alone. 115 Recent Chinese studies bolster this conclusion. For example, 
computer simulations in a 2013 PLA study found that China’s missile inventory could knock out only a few Taiwanese air bases for a few hours. 116 
 Assume nonetheless for the sake of conservatism that China could 
destroy most of Taiwan’s air and naval forces in a surprise attack and 
quickly establish air and sea dominance. Would China then be able to conquer Taiwan via amphibious invasion or coerce it via a naval blockade or 
strategic bombing? Below, I consider each of these scenarios. 
MILITARY TRENDS
81
 amphibious invasion 
 An amphibious invasion is the most diffi cult mission in warfare and 
requires three vital elements. 117 An attacker must achieve air superiority. 
The attacker must land forces in a place where they outnumber the defender. 
The attacker must surge reinforcements to the landing zone faster than the 
defender. In the successful amphibious invasions of World War II and the 
Korean War, the United States and its allies enjoyed all three advantages—
and still suffered huge losses. 
 Assuming that China already has air superiority, could it land enough 
troops on Taiwan’s shores to secure a beachhead and then reinforce that 
position faster than Taiwan’s defenders could converge on the landing site? 
China currently has 89 amphibious ships. 118 If all of them survived the 
eight-hour trip across the Taiwan Strait, the PLA could land a maximum of 
26,000 troops and 640 armored vehicles on Taiwan’s shores. 119 Taiwan has 
150,000 active-duty troops and 1.5 million reservists. 120 With that force, Taiwan theoretically could station 2,000 defenders per mile along its shores 
and have more troops over any stretch of thirteen miles as China could 
deploy using its entire amphibious fl eet. 
 In reality, Taiwan will have many more troops at the point of attack, 
because only 10 percent of Taiwan’s coastline is suitable for an amphibious 
landing. 121 The east coast is off limits, because it consists of steep cliffs, and 
PLA landing craft would have to sail an extra day around Taiwan to reach 
it, a journey during which they might encounter rough seas—twenty-foot 
waves and torrential rain are common in Taiwan’s waters—and attacks 
from any surviving Taiwanese ships, aircraft, or shore-based missile batteries. 122 The west coast, on the other hand, consists mostly of mud fl ats that 
extend two to fi ve miles out to sea and are buffeted by severe tides. To avoid 
getting stuck in the mud, PLA units would have to land at high tide at one 
of a few suitable locations. Taiwan’s military leaders know these locations 
well and would concentrate defenders at them. 
 In addition, Taiwanese intelligence would see the PLA armada approaching and tell the army where to mass. Even if these intelligence systems 
failed, Taiwanese soldiers would see the PLA armada at least thirty minutes 
before it reached the shoreline, providing time for Taiwan’s army to mass at 
the landing site. 123 For all these reasons, China could not achieve even a 
temporary numerical advantage at the landing zone. China therefore would 
lack the second necessary element of a successful amphibious invasion. 
 China also lacks the third crucial element of a successful invasion—the 
ability to reinforce the initial assault faster than Taiwan can strengthen its 
defenses at the point of attack. The PLA could ferry a maximum of 18,000 
troops per day to the landing zone, assuming that none of its amphibious 
ships are destroyed or break down. 124 Taiwan, by contrast, could surge at 
least 50,000 troops per day to battlefi eld via roads, railways, and aircraft. 125
CHAPTER 4
82
After forty-eight hours, therefore, at least 100,000 Taiwanese troops would 
face, at most, 44,000 PLA attackers—and from there the military balance 
would shift increasingly in Taiwan’s favor. 
 China could transport additional troops across the strait using fi shing 
boats and coast guard ships. These vessels, however, cannot hold large 
numbers of personnel or armored vehicles and, crucially, cannot carry landing craft, so troops ferried by them would have to swim or trudge through 
mud to get ashore at the landing site. Moreover, with no heavy armor and 
few or no weapons, civilian ships would be vulnerable to attack from Taiwanese coastal artillery. 
 China could supplement its invasion with an airlift of two brigades 
(roughly 6,000 troops and some light vehicles). 126 Even if all 6,000 paratroopers landed safely on Taiwan, however, they would be isolated and 
outnumbered. More important, China probably could not get anywhere 
close to 6,000 paratroopers on Taiwan, because PLA transport aircraft 
would encounter heavy fi re from Taiwan’s air defenses. Modern surface-toair missiles are extremely effective against large, low-fl ying transport aircraft. As noted earlier, Taiwan has thousands of surface-to-air missile 
launchers and four hundred antiaircraft guns. Even if Chinese air and missile strikes eliminated half of these, attrition rates of Chinese transport aircraft fl ying over Taiwan could exceed 50 percent per sortie. 127
 In sum, the PLA could land a maximum of 26,000 troops on Taiwan’s 
shores on the fi rst day of a war and 18,000 troops each day thereafter. These 
numbers, however, do not account for attrition to PLA forces, which would 
be enormous. 
 For starters, unless China destroyed all of Taiwan’s antiship missile 
launchers, Taiwan could “thin the herd” of PLA amphibious ships as they 
load in Chinese ports or transit the Taiwan Strait. Computer simulations 
suggest that Taiwan would only need to fi re fi fty precision-guided missiles 
to destroy a dozen Chinese amphibious ships, losses that would end all 
hopes of a successful invasion. 128 Taiwan also could bombard PLA landing 
craft with short-range artillery fi re as they made their fi nal twenty-minute 
run into the beach. 129
 Past invasions suggest that the PLA would lose many ships. During the 
1982 Falklands War, when the United Kingdom carried out the only major 
amphibious assault in the past forty years, an Argentine military with only 
ninety-fi ve combat aircraft, fi ve antiship cruise missiles, and some World 
War II era “dumb” bombs (half of which failed to explode) sank 15 percent of 
Britain’s naval task force (fi ve ships out of thirty-three), and damaged an 
additional 35 percent, even though British ships never came within four hundred miles of the Argentine mainland. 130 Chinese naval losses would almost 
certainly be greater than 15 percent, as China’s ships would be operating 
within a hundred miles of Taiwan from the moment they left Chinese ports 
and would spend substantial time within the range of Taiwan’s artillery. 
MILITARY TRENDS
83
 If PLA ships somehow landed on Taiwan’s shores, Chinese troops would 
then need to run up the beaches and attack Taiwanese defenses—actions 
that essentially guarantee mass casualties. During the D-Day assault of 
1944, the United States lost roughly 10 percent of its troops on the beaches 
while attacking a severely overstretched German army (most German 
units, including all of Germany’s most highly-trained units, were fi ghting 
the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe) defending thin positions on foreign 
soil with small arms and mortars. 131 If the PLA invaded Taiwan today, it 
would be attacking massed forces defending home soil with precisionguided munitions, helicopter gunships, tanks, and smart mines. PLA 
losses during each wave of attack, therefore, would likely be much higher 
than 10 percent. 
 Adding the most conservative loss rates together suggests that China 
would lose at least 25 percent of its forces each time its amphibious fl eet 
approached Taiwan. China therefore could not hope to land more than 
20,000 troops in its initial assault and 15,000 troops the day after—assuming 
the initial wave of troops could hold the beachhead in the fi rst place. 
 China, therefore, probably could not conquer Taiwan, even in the absence 
of U.S. intervention. Even if China’s prospects are better than I have suggested, the PLA clearly would have its hands full just dealing with Taiwan’s 
defenders. Consequently, the United States would only need to tip the 
scales of the battle to foil a Chinese invasion, a mission that could be accomplished in numerous ways without exposing U.S. surface ships or nonstealth aircraft to China’s A2/AD forces. 
 Specifi cally, American defense planners estimate that it would take ten 
thousand to twenty thousand pounds of ordnance to decimate a PLA invasion force on the beaches of Taiwan. 132 The U.S. military could deliver that 
payload many times over with a single B-2 bomber or an Ohio-class submarine fi ring cruise missiles from an underwater location hundreds of miles 
away. Alternatively, the United States could unleash its attack submarines 
on the PLA invasion fl eet; computer simulations show that eight U.S. submarines could sink 40 percent of the PLA’s amphibious ships during any 
given transit across the strait while losing perhaps one submarine. 133
 blockade 
 If China cannot invade Taiwan, could it coerce Taiwan into submission 
instead? China’s most promising coercive tactic is a blockade in which the 
PLA tries to strangle Taiwan’s economy by preventing commercial ships 
from reaching Taiwan’s ports. Taiwan is vulnerable to a blockade: it imports 
60 percent of its food and 98 percent of its energy resources; maintains only 
a ninety-day supply of oil; and has a small coastline that forces large container ships to take predictable paths to seven major ports, four of which 
are located on Taiwan’s west coast facing China. 134
CHAPTER 4
84
 China could blockade Taiwan in several ways. The most aggressive 
approach would be for China to destroy Taiwan’s air and naval forces, commercial port facilities, and offshore oil terminals in a surprise attack and 
then send PLA submarines to sink cargo ships and deploy mines near Taiwan’s harbors. If China’s surprise attack destroyed all of Taiwan’s offensive 
forces and port infrastructure—an unlikely outcome, as explained earlier—
Taiwan’s economy would grind to a halt, because Taiwan would have no 
way to unload large cargo containers or oil tankers. 135 Given such dire circumstances, would life on Taiwan become so unbearable that Taipei would 
submit to Beijing’s authority? 
 The answer would depend on two main factors: China’s ability to choke 
Taiwan off from basic survival levels of food and energy resources; and the 
resolve of the Taiwanese people to endure hardship. 
 Regarding the fi rst factor, China probably could not cut Taiwan off entirely 
from critical supplies, because Taiwan could ferry limited amounts of cargo 
to small harbors using shuttle tankers and barges. 136 China would try to sink 
merchant ships supplying Taiwan, but rigorous research suggests that the 
PLA could sink only 1 to 6 percent of Taiwan’s shipping, and these results 
are based on assumptions that heavily favor China: specifi cally, these results 
assume a Chinese submarine force of sixty-three boats (China currently only 
has fi fty-three attack submarines) and that Chinese submarines always fi nd 
targets to attack, achieve historically high kill rates, experience no maintenance problems, and encounter no enemy resistance. 137 
 China might hope that sinking a few merchant ships would deter others 
from supplying Taiwan. Historically, however, shipping companies and 
privateers have operated in wartime; in fact, many have volunteered to 
enter dangerous areas so that they could charge higher premiums. For 
example, the lure of profi ts kept seaborne commerce going throughout both 
world wars and the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War, wars in which shipping losses 
were several times greater than what China could hope to infl ict on Taiwan. 138 If money failed to motivate merchants to dock in Taiwan, the Taiwanese government could commandeer some of the 23 oil tankers and 326 
large cargo ships registered under the Taiwanese fl ag and compel them to 
keep operating. 139
 Assume for the sake of conservatism, however, that China succeeds in 
completely cutting Taiwan off from external supplies. Would China then be 
able to conquer Taiwan? 
 The fi rst thing to note is that no blockade in the past two hundred years 
has coerced a country into surrendering its sovereignty. 140 The reason is that 
modern states can adapt to supply shortages and civilian populations are 
usually willing to endure enormous punishment to defy foreign enemies. 
The most comprehensive blockade in history was the U.S. blockade of 
Japan in the early 1940s (codenamed Operation Starvation), which slashed 
Japan’s imports by 97 percent. Japan, however, surrendered only after the 
MILITARY TRENDS
85
United States decimated Japan’s military, leveled most of its major cities, 
dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and got the Soviet 
Union to declare war on Japan in 1945. 141
 For China to buck this historical trend, the Taiwanese people would need 
to be abnormally weak-willed or strongly predisposed toward reunifi cation with the mainland. Given Taiwan’s Chinese heritage, the latter possibility can never be discounted. At present, however, the Taiwanese people 
do not seem like they would cave quickly to Chinese coercion: 60 percent of 
Taiwan’s population (and 85 percent of the twenty to thirty-year-old population) identifi es solely as Taiwanese whereas only 3 percent identify solely 
as Chinese; 142 the Democratic Progressive Party, which leans toward Taiwanese independence, won both the presidency and a majority in the legislature in the 2016 elections, in part because voters felt that the previous 
Kuomintang regime was getting too cozy with China; and the Taiwanese 
government maintains a massive network of underground shelters stocked 
with food, fuel, and medical supplies. 143
 Therefore, if China blockaded Taiwan, and the United States decided to 
intervene, the United States would probably have several weeks, if not 
months, to rally an international coalition and explore options, some of 
which would pose little or no risk to the U.S. military. For example, the 
United States could impose fi nancial sanctions on China or cut China off 
from 80 percent of its oil imports by blockading the Strait of Malacca, near 
Singapore, beyond the range of most of China’s military forces. 144
 Alternatively, U.S. antisubmarine warfare forces could attack China’s submarines and escort merchant ships to Taiwan. Such attacks obviously would 
entail risks for American sailors and pilots, but they also would capitalize on 
considerable U.S. advantages: U.S. attack submarines are faster, quieter, and 
have far greater endurance than Chinese submarines; the United States has 
a robust underwater sensor array in the waters east of Taiwan; the United 
States has recently developed drones that can hunt for Chinese submarines 
for seventy days straight and travel ten thousand miles; China’s antisubmarine forces are weak (its diesel-powered submarines lack the speed and 
endurance necessary to sweep large areas; it only has a dozen surface ships 
with towed sonar arrays and seven fi xed-wing antisubmarine warfare aircraft; and has few ships that can accommodate antisubmarine warfare helicopters, so most of China’s rotary force can only patrol limited areas near 
China’s coasts); 145 and whereas U.S. submarines could loiter silently in the 
waters near Taiwan, Chinese submarines would have to expose their positions to enforce the blockade (as soon as a Chinese submarine fi res on a merchant ship, U.S. sensors can pinpoint its location). 146 
 Historically, antisubmarine warfare forces have been able to disrupt 
blockades. 147 Germany’s attempted blockade of Allied shipping in World 
War II, for example, collapsed in two months once the Allies launched a 
dedicated antisubmarine warfare campaign, and attempts by Iran and Iraq 
CHAPTER 4
86
to blockade each other in the 1980s fl oundered because neither side could 
maintain sea control. 148 The U.S. blockade of Japan in World War II, by contrast, was enforced only after the United States won command of the seas 
around Japan—and even in this extreme case, it remains unclear if the 
blockade played a decisive role in the outcome of the war. 
 In sum, a PLA blockade of Taiwan would be a protracted operation with 
a low probability of success. Should the United States choose to intervene, 
it would have time to consider an array of options, the most aggressive of 
which would play to U.S. strengths. A submarine blockade might be China’s best option for forcing Taiwan’s reunifi cation with the mainland, but it 
is hardly a reliable option. 
 strategic bombing 
 An alternative coercive tactic would be a strategic bombing campaign, in 
which the PLA tries to force cross-strait reunifi cation by leveling Taiwan’s 
cities and infrastructure. The historical record, however, suggests that this 
tactic would be even less effective than a blockade. 
 There have been only fourteen strategic bombing campaigns in history, 
and none decisively affected the outcome of the wars in which they were 
used (see this endnote for the list of cases). 149 The best that can be said of 
any of these campaigns is that they hastened the surrender of states that 
were already going down to defeat. In short, no state has ever conquered 
another with air power alone, largely for the same reasons that no country 
has ever conquered another with a blockade in the past two hundred years: 
modern states can adapt to the loss of critical infrastructure, and civilian 
populations usually react to foreign bombing by digging in and rallying 
around their home government. 150 As noted above, Taiwan does not give 
the impression that it will be the fi rst nation to break the historical pattern. 
 China might be able to use strategic bombing to reinforce the political 
status quo in Taiwan. Opinion polls show that most Taiwanese are willing 
to court confl ict with China to maintain Taiwan’s de facto independence, 
but not to achieve de jure independence. 151 Thus China could potentially 
deter Taiwan from offi cially declaring independence by threatening to 
bomb it (arguably, China has already done so for decades) and perhaps 
even force Taiwan’s government to retract a hasty declaration of independence by carrying out a partial bombing campaign. 
 China, however, probably cannot compel Taiwan to give up its de facto 
sovereignty by raining hell on Taiwan’s cities. Strategic bombing is not only 
historically ineffective, it also does not neatly serve China’s ultimate political objectives. In most of the past bombing campaigns cited above, the 
attacker simply wanted the defender to desist from some action, a goal that 
conceivably could be achieved by bombing the defender into oblivion. 
China, by contrast, wants to reincorporate Taiwan as a prosperous Chinese 
MILITARY TRENDS
87
province and turn Taiwan’s people into loyal Chinese citizens. Reducing 
Taipei to a smoldering ruin and incinerating hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese civilians would not achieve that end. 
 Sea Control in the East China Sea 
 Roughly a hundred miles northeast of Taiwan, China is in a showdown with 
Japan over eight islets, which the Japanese call the Senkakus and the Chinese 
call the Diaoyutai. The islets themselves are insignifi cant—none are inhabited or larger than two square miles—but they are the symbolic epicenter of a 
broader struggle between China and Japan for control of the East China Sea. 
 This confl ict is rooted in geography. China and Japan are two great powers packed into a small space and sit astride each other’s vital sea-lanes. 
The Japanese home islands are only fi ve hundred miles across the East 
China Sea from Shanghai, a distance that could be traversed in a day by a 
ship, in half an hour by a fi ghter plane, and in minutes by a missile. Japan 
also controls the Ryukyus, a chain of more than a hundred islands that 
stretch from the Japanese home islands to within seventy miles of Taiwan. 
All of China’s most direct routes to the Pacifi c Ocean run through choke 
points between these islands. 
 China claims sovereignty over the Senkakus and exclusive rights, including 
the right to control military traffi c, throughout most of the East China Sea. 152
China also maintains an air defense identifi cation zone (ADIZ) over most of 
the sea and describes the skies in this zone as “Chinese airspace,” a claim that 
implies that China has sovereignty over the waters and land below. 153 
 If China could somehow enforce these claims, it would gain direct access 
to the Pacifi c, a secure coastline stretching from Beijing to Shanghai to 
Fuzhou, lucrative fi shing grounds and oil deposits, and a staging area for 
blockades of Japan and Taiwan. Given these stakes, not to mention the historical grievances generated by Japan’s brutal occupation of China in the 
1930s, it is understandable why China is determined to dominate the East 
China Sea—and why Japan is equally determined to defend its own claims 
in the East China Sea, which include sovereignty over the Senkakus and 
exclusive rights and an ADIZ over roughly half of the sea. 
 In theory, China could enforce its East China Sea claims nonviolently 
using economic coercion and the cabbage strategy described earlier. In 
practice, however, China will probably have to decimate Japan’s air and 
naval forces, because Japan has made clear it will fi ght to defend its East 
China Sea claims. Since 2010, China has conducted regular patrols around 
the Senkakus with hundreds of coast guard cutters, fi shing vessels, and 
military aircraft. 154 Japan, however, has responded in kind, maintaining a 
sizable coast guard and naval presence in contested waters and scrambling 
fi ghters to the Senkakus hundreds of times per year. 155
CHAPTER 4
88
 What are China’s prospects of destroying Japan’s air and naval forces? In 
the 1990s, the Japanese Self-Defense Force enjoyed insurmountable qualitative superiority over the PLA and could essentially command the East China 
Sea. Today, however, China has numerous surface ships, submarines, shorebased missile batteries, and combat aircraft all armed with advanced missiles and backed by a defense budget that is nearly four times larger than 
Japan’s. 156 Japan currently has almost twice as many advanced destroyers as 
China (thirty-fi ve versus twenty-one), but some analysts predict that by 
2030 China will have thirty-four destroyers and a fi ve hundred-ship navy. 157
 The balance of naval tonnage, therefore, is clearly shifting in China’s 
favor. Nevertheless, Japan retains enduring geographic and technological 
advantages that will allow it to deny China sea and air control throughout 
much of the East China Sea for the foreseeable future. 
 First, Japan has announced plans to string a line of missile launchers 
along the Ryukyu Islands that can target all naval and air traffi c across a 
two hundred mile band stretching north to south between mainland Japan 
and Taiwan, an area that includes the Senkaku Islands. 158 As discussed earlier, it is extremely diffi cult to destroy mobile missile launchers with air and 
missile strikes or amphibious assaults. Thus Japan will soon have a resilient 
missile force running the length of the East China Sea. 
 Japan is also expanding its submarine fl eet from seventeen to twenty-two 
boats and maintains an extensive network of underwater sensors in the Yellow and East China Seas that is integrated with the U.S. undersea surveillance system and can track Chinese ships and submarines as they leave 
port. 159 During the Cold War, Japan’s diesel-electric boats helped contain 
Soviet submarines in the Sea of Japan. Today, Japan can do the same to 
China’s navy by attacking Chinese ships as they pass through the narrow 
seas along the Ryukyus. 160 And whereas Japanese submarines could attack 
Chinese surface ships largely unmolested by China’s weak antisubmarine 
forces, Chinese submarines would have to contend with Japan’s worldclass antisubmarine warfare forces, which include seventy-fi ve fi xed-wing 
aircraft and eighty-fi ve helicopters that can operate from bases on the 
Ryukyus or from the decks of dozens of Japanese surface ships. 161
 Japan retains robust mine warfare capabilities, including mines that can 
target specifi c ships and be laid by surface ships, submarines, and aircraft. 162 China’s navy has almost no mine-clearing capabilities, so Japan 
could mine China’s harbors or block the path of Chinese ships through the 
Ryukyus. To clear these minefi elds, Chinese minesweepers and their escorts 
would need to cross several hundred miles of contested waters and airspace, a journey many of them would not likely survive. 
 Finally, if the shore-based missiles, submarines, and mines discussed 
above failed to deny China control of the East China Sea, Japan could commit its surface fl eet and air force to the battle. China has a larger surface 
fl eet overall than Japan, but 75 percent of China’s ships are small coastal 
MILITARY TRENDS
89
patrol craft and another 15 percent are frigates with limited range, endurance, and armaments. 163 As noted, Japan currently has nearly twice as many 
large surface combatants as China, and Japan’s fi fteen smaller coastal patrol 
craft and frigates, though outnumbered by China’s fi fty-seven frigates, 
would be able to refuel and reload at ports along the Ryukyus and thus 
maintain a higher tempo of operations than China’s missile boats and frigates, which would have to transit hundreds of miles between the Ryukyus 
and the Chinese mainland to refuel and reload. 164 Japan also has more than 
two hundred fourth-generation fi ghter aircraft and will soon receive fortytwo F-35A aircraft from the United States, making Japan only the second 
country in the world with operational fi fth-generation fi ghters. 165 These 
stealth aircraft could approach Chinese naval armadas in the East China 
Sea undetected and launch missiles at Chinese ships. 
 China could try to knock Japan’s air and naval forces out of a war by 
striking Japanese ports and airfi elds. Japan, however, has 20 air bases, 11 
naval bases, and 14 naval aviation bases dispersed across more than 2,000 
miles of territory. 166 China currently has only 100 to 300 ballistic missiles, 
500 cruise missiles, and 100 aircraft (slow, nonstealthy H-6 bombers) that 
could reach these bases. Given Japan’s advanced missile and air defense 
systems, it is unlikely that China could disable many of Japan’s bases for 
long, if at all. 
 In sum, although the balance of naval tonnage is shifting in China’s favor, 
geographic and technological factors give Japan an enduring A2/AD capability that can plausibly deny China sea and air control in the East China Sea. 
 Sea Control in the South China Sea 
 China claims ownership of more than 80 percent of the South China Sea 
based on a nine-dash line sketched on a 1947 Republic of China map. This 
claim has no international standing—in July 2016, an international tribunal 
in The Hague explicitly rejected China’s historical claims to the South China 
Sea—but it appears on all Chinese maps and passports. The nine-dash line 
encloses waters through which roughly 40 percent of the world’s trade and 
90 percent of China’s imported oil passes. 
 If China could enforce its claims in the South China Sea, it would achieve 
the greatest territorial expansion by any power since Imperial Japan. 167
China would gain greater security for its supply lines, exclusive access to 
rich fi shing areas and undersea oil deposits, and unfettered access to the 
Western Pacifi c. Most important, China would effectively become the maritime hegemon of Southeast Asia, as other countries around the sea would 
be confi ned to narrow bands of water along their coastlines. 
 China, however, cannot enforce its South China Sea claims. 168 The sea is a 
hotly contested zone, with fi ve other countries laying claims to portions of 
CHAPTER 4
90
it. 169 China has a more powerful military than these Southeast Asian states, 
but they are closer than China to the areas of the sea that they claim. In a 
war, Chinese forces would need to cycle between the combat theater and a few 
bases hundreds of miles away in southern China to refuel and reload, a 
commute that would severely limit the amount of combat power China 
could sustain on the battlefi eld. Southeast Asian forces, by contrast, could 
operate from home bases bordering the combat theater and would have 
their full arsenals at their disposal. 
 Some Southeast Asian nations have capitalized on these geographic 
advantages by developing A2/AD capabilities, including shore-based missile batteries, diesel-powered attack submarines, swarms of small surface 
combatants and fi ghter aircraft armed with antiship missiles and mines. As 
a result, the western and southern sections of the South China Sea are now 
bordered by forces capable of denying China sea and air command. Only in 
the northeastern quarter of the sea, near the Philippines, could China easily 
defeat local opposition and establish sea control. 
 west 
 The west side of the South China Sea is claimed by Vietnam, which can 
credibly threaten to destroy ships and aircraft within two hundred miles of 
the Vietnamese coast—an area that encompasses the western third of the 
South China Sea and China’s military base on Hainan Island, where China 
stations roughly one-third of its navy. 170
 Most notable, Vietnam has purchased from Russia at least two mobile 
shore-based antiship cruise missile batteries that can target ships two hundred miles away. 171 China could try to destroy these batteries with air or 
missile strikes, but such strikes would have a low probability of success, 
even if China enjoyed air superiority over Vietnam—as noted earlier, the 
United States dominated the skies above Iraq and Kosovo in the 1990s but 
still failed to eliminate most of Iraq and Yugoslavia’s missile batteries. 
 More important, China probably could not establish air superiority over 
Vietnam in the fi rst place. Vietnamese air defenses have a reputation as 
“giant killers,” having shot down more than 1,700 U.S. aircraft between 1961 
and 1968 with simple antiaircraft artillery and no early warning radar. 172
Today, Vietnam fi elds some of the most advanced early warning radars and 
surface-to-air missile batteries in the world, having purchased the SPYDER 
system from Israel and S-300 batteries from Russia that can shoot down aircraft ninety miles away. Vietnam is currently in negotiations with Russia to 
purchase four S-400 batteries, which have a range of 250 miles and would 
enable Vietnam to target Chinese aircraft over mainland China. 173 
 Even if China somehow destroyed Vietnam’s shore-based cruise missile 
batteries, however, Vietnam would retain many platforms that could deny 
China sea control in the western third of the South China Sea. The 
MILITARY TRENDS
91
Vietnamese air force has more than a hundred fi ghters, including thirty-fi ve 
Su-30MK2Vs that are as advanced as any aircraft currently operational in 
China’s air force. 174 These aircraft can be armed with multiple Kh-31 supersonic antiship cruise missiles that could overwhelm the limited missile 
defense systems on China’s ships. 
 China could try to nullify this threat by engaging Vietnam in an all-out 
air war. With more than 1,000 fi ghters, China’s air force vastly outnumbers 
Vietnam’s. Vietnam’s air force, however, would be backed by ground-based 
air defenses and would operate from eighteen air bases on home soil, 
whereas Chinese aircraft would have to contend with antiaircraft fi re and 
commute several hundred miles from nine air bases in southern China. 175
China could operate a few aircraft from an airfi eld on Woody Island, which 
is two hundred miles east of Vietnam in the Paracel archipelago. This airfi eld, however, would not last long in a war; the island is less than onesquare mile in size, so personnel and platforms there have nowhere to hide 
from enemy missiles. In sum, China could potentially destroy Vietnam’s air 
force in a protracted air war, but only at great cost. 
 Even if China destroyed Vietnam’s air force, Vietnam’s navy could still contest Chinese sea control using six Kilo-class diesel-powered submarines that 
have better range, endurance, sensors, and acoustics than China’s diesel submarines and carry torpedoes, mines, and Klub-S submerged-launch cruise 
missiles that accelerate to supersonic speeds and perform evasive maneuvers 
as they approach their targets, making them extremely diffi cult to shoot 
down. 176 Vietnam lacks experience with submarine operations and maintenance, so it is doubtful that it could maintain more than two submarines ready 
for operations at any given time. 177 However, even a single Vietnamese submarine operated by a mediocre crew could pose a persistent threat to a Chinese naval armada. During the Falklands War, for example, a lone Argentinian 
midget submarine operated by a crew of junior petty offi cers evaded the British fl eet throughout the war—even though the British navy expended nearly 
all of its antisubmarine ordinance trying to destroy the submarine—and successfully tracked and targeted several British warships. Only a torpedo malfunction saved the targeted British ships from destruction. 178 
 Vietnam also has twenty-six warships armed with antiship missiles, 
including six new stealthy Gepard-class frigates, purchased from Russia, 
twelve corvettes, and eight smaller missile boats. 179 These surface ships are 
not nearly as capable as China’s modern destroyers and frigates, but they 
carry advanced missiles with ranges between 70 to 100 miles and may soon 
carry the BrahMos missile, jointly developed by Russia and India, which is 
the most lethal cruise missile in the world: the BrahMos has a range of 190 
miles; skims just above the sea; performs evasive S-maneuvers shortly 
before impact; and is four times faster (2,300 miles per hour) and several 
times heavier (6,000 pounds) than U.S. Tomahawk missiles. In tests, the 
BrahMos obliterated large ships even when its warhead failed to explode. 180
CHAPTER 4

 In sum, Vietnam has developed a credible A2/AD force. Vietnam cannot 
enforce its own claims in the South China Sea, but it can threaten to destroy 
Chinese ships and aircraft operating in the western third of the South China 
Sea. Given the bloody history between the two countries—the 1974 naval 
battle over the Paracels; the 1979 border war that killed tens of thousands of 
troops on both sides; the 1988 naval battle in the Spratlys in which Chinese 
forces killed seventy Vietnamese sailors; and the deadly anti-Chinese riots 
in Vietnam in 2014—Vietnam seems unlikely to allow China to command 
the western South China Sea without a fi ght. 181
 south 
 China also has little hope of establishing sea control anywhere in the 
southern portions of the South China Sea, by which I mean the waters south 
of Vietnam on one side and the Spratly Islands on the other. 
 The countries that claim this area—Indonesia and Malaysia—are much 
weaker than China militarily, but they border contested areas, whereas 
China is more than a thousand miles away. In a confl ict there, China’s navy 
would have to transit several days each way between the combat theater 
and China’s naval base on Hainan. Consequently, China probably could 
not maintain more than a dozen ships and submarines in the combat theater at any given time, even if China redeployed vessels from the East China 
Sea and the Yellow Sea, an unlikely proposition given that China has to 
keep tabs on Japan and Taiwan. 
 China also probably could not sustain major air operations in the southern portion of the South China Sea, because China only has thirteen mid-air 
refueling tankers and sixteen airborne early warning and control aircraft, 
which Chinese combat aircraft would need for targeting, and its two aircraft carriers only carry twenty-four fi ghters each, and these aircraft have to 
fl y with half their normal capacity of fuel and armaments due to the carriers’ ski-jump takeoff systems. 182
 The nature of a war in the southern South China Sea would depend on 
where China made its stand. If China tried to establish sea control in the 
center of the area, it might fi nd itself in a war with Indonesia, which occupies the Natuna Islands and claims territorial waters and a 200-nautical-mile 
exclusive economic zone around them. If China tried to control the waters 
to the east or west of Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone, it would come 
into confl ict with Malaysia, whose exclusive economic zone and territorial 
seas begin where Indonesia’s end. 
 Indonesia and Malaysia could plausibly deny sea and air control to a 
restricted Chinese task force. Indonesia’s navy has twelve frigates, twenty 
corvettes, and thirty fast-attack patrol boats all armed with antiship missiles. 183 In addition, Indonesia operates two submarines armed with torpedoes and has procured three stealthy diesel-powered submarines made in 
MILITARY TRENDS
93
South Korea that will carry antiship missiles and cutting-edge electronic 
defense and radar signal detection systems. 184 The fi rst of these new submarines began sea trials in 2016 and all three are expected to be operational 
by 2020. Indonesia’s submarine crews have never been tested in wartime, 
so it is unclear how profi cient they would be at targeting Chinese ships. 
That said, Indonesia has operated submarines for more than thirty-fi ve 
years and thus has more experience than most countries in basic submarine 
operations and maintenance. 185
 Indonesia has declared it will have a “green-water” navy by 2024 with a 
minimum operational force of 110 warships, 66 patrol ships, 98 support 
ships, and 12 submarines. 186 This goal is unrealistic, but even with a quarter 
of this fl eet, Indonesia’s navy would enjoy numerical superiority over a 
Chinese task force near the Natunas, because Indonesia’s ships could operate from two bases within three hundred miles of the combat theater and 
from a new base on the Natunas themselves and another at Mempawah 
less than two hundred miles away. 187
 For similar reasons, Indonesia also would probably enjoy a local superiority in fi ghter aircraft. Indonesia’s air force has 49 fourth-generation fi ghters, including 33 F-16s, 11 Su-30s, and 5 Su-27s, and is in negotiations with 
Russia to buy 10 Su-35S fi ghters, which feature fi fth-generation avionics 
and radar technologies and thrust-vectoring engines. 188 In a confl ict with 
China, Indonesia’s fi ghters could operate without aerial refueling from four 
air bases within 500 miles of the Natunas and an expanded air base on the 
islands themselves. 189
 Malaysia has fewer platforms than Indonesia, but its sailors and pilots are 
generally better trained. Thus its A2/AD forces are more capable than they 
may seem on paper. For example, Malaysia only has two submarines, but both 
of these boats are advanced diesel-powered submarines made in France, 
Malaysian maintenance crews have shown that they can keep one submarine 
operational at any given time, and Malaysian submarine crews collectively 
spent more than 9,000 hours in submerged training exercises between 2009 and 
2017, making them one of the most experienced crews in Southeast Asia. 190 
 Malaysia also has ten frigates, and twelve patrol boats all armed with 
French- and Italian-made antiship cruise missiles. 191 Malaysia’s frigates 
also carry sixteen surface-to-air missiles, torpedoes, and cannons, and have 
deck space for antisubmarine warfare helicopters. In 2019, Malaysia will 
add six stealth frigates with similar armaments and towed sonar arrays. 192
In a confl ict with China, these ships could operate from at least twelve 
bases around the southern shore of the South China Sea. 
 Malaysia’s air force enjoys similar proximity to potential combat theaters, 
with at least eight airfi elds within the unrefueled range of the southern 
South China Sea. Malaysia has 36 fourth-generation fi ghters, including 18 
Su-30s that can launch Kh-31 supersonic antiship missiles from beyond the 
range of the air defenses of China’s ships. 193
CHAPTER 4
94
 east 
 The east side of the South China Sea is the most-contested area, with six 
countries laying claims to various portions of it. Territorial disputes center 
on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago of a hundred small features spread 
across 160,000 square miles of sea. These features collectively have less than 
two square miles of natural land above the water, but China is reclaiming 
land and placing airstrips and docks on the seven features in the Spratlys 
that it currently occupies. 
 China hopes to take over the Spratlys without fi ring a shot by creating 
facts on the ground—that is, by fl ooding the zone with Chinese ships and 
steadily occupying and turning tiny features into habitable islands that 
ultimately gain international acceptance, if not recognition, as Chinese 
territory. 
 China’s plan, however, faces two obstacles: the 2016 ruling by the tribunal 
in The Hague dashed China’s legal claims to the area; 194 and four other countries militarily occupy features in the Spratlys and are unlikely to budge 
unless China uses force. Vietnam occupies twenty-one features and has built 
airstrips on two of them, reclaimed land on at least ten others, and placed 
mobile rocket launchers on at least fi ve features that can target ships and 
installations within ninety miles—an area that includes all of China’s outposts in the Spratlys. 195 Taiwan occupies and maintains an airstrip on the 
largest natural feature in the Spratlys, Itu Aba, which accounts for roughly 
half of the natural land above the water in the archipelago. Malaysia occupies 
fi ve features and has placed military outposts on three of them, one of which 
has an airstrip. And the Philippines occupies nine features and maintains 
small military outposts on eight of them and a community of about three 
hundred civilians and forty military personnel on the remaining feature. 
 In short, China’s neighbors are fi rmly ensconced in the Spratlys and are 
backed by international law. To enforce its claims to the area, therefore, 
China would need to use military force. What are its prospects? 
 To control the Spratlys, China fi rst would need to establish air superiority 
over them. The Spratlys, however, are nearly seven hundred miles away 
from China’s nearest air base on Hainan and more than eight hundred 
miles from its air bases in southern China. China only has fi ve hundred 
combat aircraft capable of making this journey, and these aircraft would 
only be able to spend a few minutes near the Spratlys before returning 
home to refuel. 196 As a result, China would have, at most, a few dozen combat aircraft near the Spratlys at any given time. 197 Vietnam and Malaysia, by 
contrast, have numerous air bases within the unrefueled range of the archipelago and thus would have the full strength of their combat air fl eets 
available for an air war. 
 China could fl y a few fi ghters from airstrips on Fiery Cross, Subi, and 
Mischief Reefs and forty-eight additional fi ghters from its two aircraft 
MILITARY TRENDS
95
carriers. 198 China also could conduct mid-air refueling operations using its 
thirteen tanker aircraft. These assets, however, have limited defenses and 
probably would not last long in a major war. Vietnam and Malaysia have 
several submarines and dozens of aircraft and naval ships armed with 
advanced missiles, and Vietnam has highly accurate rocket launchers 
installed within range of China’s airstrips in the Spratlys. 
 Given these obstacles, China is unlikely to try to take the Spratlys all at 
once and incur the wrath of the whole region. Instead, China is more likely 
to pick off its rivals one-by-one and carve out a limited section of the sea. 
The easiest target for such limited expansion is the northeast quarter of the 
sea, which is claimed by the Philippines, a country with no missile-armed 
ships or aircraft. If China imposed itself in this area, there is little the Philippine military could do in response, and other Southeast Asian countries 
would probably stay out of the fi ght as long as China did not try to take 
over the areas that they claim. Given that the Philippines has signed a 
defense pact with the United States, these waters also are the most likely 
site of a U.S-China war in the South China Sea. 
 Fortunately for the United States, the area is far from China. Unlike in a 
Taiwan scenario, China’s shore-based surface-to-air missiles cannot target 
aircraft near the Philippines, so China would have to rely on its combat 
aircraft and sea-based air defenses to establish air superiority. As noted, 
however, China only has about fi ve hundred combat aircraft capable of 
reaching the east side of the sea, and these aircraft could only loiter for a 
few minutes near the Spratlys before returning to China to refuel. 199
 The United States, by contrast, could keep hundreds of aircraft over the 
islands at all times, because U.S. forces could operate from air bases in the 
southern Philippines beyond the range of all but a hundred to two hundred 
of China’s conventional ballistic missiles. 200 China could try to attack these 
bases with H-6 bombers armed with long-range cruise missiles, but the 
slow speed of these bombers and missiles expose them to intercepts by U.S. 
fi ghters and air and missile defense systems. 201
 The Philippines, of course, might deny the U.S. military access to its 
bases, but such an outcome is unlikely: since 1945, more than 90 percent of 
U.S. requests for contingency base access have been granted, and in many 
of these cases the United States had no preexisting bases in the country in 
question (unlike in the Philippines today) and the host country was not 
under attack or otherwise involved in the confl ict. Given this sterling record 
of U.S. base access, it seems unlikely that the Philippines would respond to 
Chinese annexation of Filipino waters by denying the U.S. military access 
to Filipino airfi elds. 202 Yes, the Filipino president, Rodrigo Duterte, has 
repeatedly threatened to downgrade the U.S.-Filipino alliance, but he also 
has authorized the United States to upgrade its military facilities in the 
Philippines, ordered further reclamation on Philippine-held islands in the 
Spratlys, instructed Filipino troops to “fi ght to the death” to defend these 
CHAPTER 4
96
islands against China, and threatened to raise the Philippine fl ag himself on 
Thitu Island and to ride out to other Chinese-claimed features on his jet ski 
and plant Philippine fl ags on them too. 203 Furthermore, recent polls show 
that more than 80 percent of Filipinos favor defending Philippine-held features in the Spratlys from Chinese annexation, and recent Filipino government and military elites (most notably the defense minister) have publicly 
pressured Duterte to confront China’s navy and coast guard. 204
 Even if the Philippines does expel the U.S. military, the U.S. military 
could still mass airpower over the Spratlys from carriers east of the Philippines, beyond the range of most of China’s A2/AD forces. Alternatively, 
U.S. aircraft could operate with the help of aerial refueling from U.S. bases 
in Guam, Australia, and Japan and from additional airfi elds in the Marianas. Or the United States could request contingency access at some of the 
hundred airfi elds maintained by other Southeast Asian states that have 
maritime disputes with China. 205
 Computer simulations show that a single U.S. air wing operating only 
from bases in Guam and Japan could destroy more than half of China’s 
strike aircraft in three weeks in a Spratly Islands scenario, and two U.S. air 
wings could do the same in less than a week. 206 If China attacked these 
bases, the U.S. military could respond in kind by cratering the runways at 
China’s nine air bases within range of the Spratlys, actions that would 
knock China’s air force out of a Spratly Islands war within hours. 207
 Without air cover, China’s 19 destroyers and 57 frigates would be vulnerable to U.S. missiles launched by aircraft as well as ships and submarines. 
China’s cruise missiles currently outrange America’s, but by 2019 the U.S. 
military will regain the upper hand: new U.S. sea-launched antiship cruise 
missiles will have a range of 1,000 miles and new U.S. air-launched antiship 
cruise missiles will have a range of 570 miles; China’s newest sea- and airlaunched cruise missiles, by contrast, have ranges of 330 miles and 250 miles 
respectively. 208
 China could escort its surface ships with submarines. But China’s fi ve 
nuclear-powered attack submarines are noisier than U.S. submarines from 
the 1960s; and China’s diesel-powered submarines would need to deploy 
their snorkels during the long journey to the combat theater (making the submarines easily detectable) and would only be able to operate in the area for a 
few weeks before returning to China’s naval base on Hainan Island to 
refuel—assuming that the United States did not disable this base with missile 
strikes. American submarines, by contrast, could remain in the combat theater for months. 209 Moreover, if the United States had air superiority, it could 
deploy hundreds of antisubmarine warfare aircraft to hunt for Chinese submarines throughout the area. 210 Even without air superiority, the U.S. navy 
could attack China’s fl eet with submarines and its emerging fl eet of drones 
armed with torpedoes. 211 In such a contested environment, China’s submarines and surface ships would do well to survive for more than a few weeks. 212
MILITARY TRENDS
97
 In sum, local actors can plausibly deny China sea and air control in the 
western and southern portions of the South China Sea, and the United 
States could deny China control of the northeast quarter of the sea at moderate risk to U.S. forces. China therefore faces a robust containment barrier 
and cannot command major portions of its near seas—at least for now. 
 The United States has multiple times the net stocks of military assets of 
China and maintains a daunting containment barrier against Chinese 
expansion in East Asia. These results, combined with the discussion of China’s economic problems in chapter 3 , show that the United States retains a 
preponderance of power over China. For China or any other nation to catch 
up to the United States, they will need to grow their power base much 
faster than they currently are. How likely is that? 
98
 chapter 5 
 Future Prospects 
 This chapter analyzes the future prospects of the great powers and shows 
that the United States has the best foundation for continued growth. 
 I begin by addressing a fundamental question: what drives the rise and 
fall of the great powers? International relations scholars have used two 
main theories to answer to this question: balance-of-power theory and convergence theory. 1
 Balance-of-power theory holds that weak states gang up 
on strong states and force a redistribution of power in the international system. Convergence theory, on the other hand, holds that poor countries 
grow faster than rich countries, thus rising challengers inevitably overtake 
established hegemons. 
 I argue that neither theory applies today. Balance-of-power dynamics are 
muted, because weaker states lack the wealth and military capabilities necessary to mount a sustained challenge to U.S. primacy. Convergence theory, 
on the other hand, is underspecifi ed. Sometimes poor countries grow faster 
than rich countries, and sometimes they fall further behind. Knowing 
which scenario is more likely in the coming decades requires identifying 
the drivers of economic growth and assessing the prospects of today’s 
major powers in light of these factors. 
 This chapter does exactly that. Drawing on research in the field of 
economics, I show that there are three main drivers of long-run economic growth: geography, institutions, and demography. I then use 
indicators of each to assess the prospects of the eight most powerful 
countries: the United States, China, Russia, Japan, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, France, and India. The United States does not rank first in all 
sources of strength, but it scores highly across the board whereas the 
other countries suffer from critical weaknesses. The United States thus 
has the best prospects to amass wealth and military power in the decades 
ahead. 
FUTURE PROSPECTS
99
 Balance-of-Power Theory: Muted 
 The logic of balance-of-power theory is intuitive: states want power for themselves and fear it in the hands of others, so when one nation starts to become 
more powerful than the rest, weaker countries usually react by building up 
their militaries and banding together to strangle the emerging hegemon. 2
 
 This instinctive fear of concentrated power stems from the anarchical 
nature of the international system. With no world government to shelter 
the weak from the strong, countries have to protect themselves by acquiring arms, forming alliances, and doing whatever else they can to prevent 
rivals from amassing preponderant power. The violent reactions of other 
countries to the rise of Habsburg Spain, Napoleonic France, and Imperial 
Germany illustrate the point. 
 Balance-of-power theory helps explain why bids for hegemony usually 
fail. But what happens when one succeeds? On the rare occasion when one 
nation becomes much more powerful than the rest, balancing dynamics 
may become muted. 3
 The reason is that in a unipolar system, no country is strong enough to 
balance the leader singlehandedly, so balancing requires cooperation 
among many countries, each of which has incentives to free ride on the 
efforts of its partners. This collective action dilemma allows the leader to 
play divide-and-conquer, punishing adversaries while rewarding allies. 
 Given the high costs of balancing, and the low likelihood of success, 
many weaker states will simply bandwagon with the sole superpower, or at 
least avoid provoking it. 4
 Weaker nations may gripe about the hegemon’s 
power and try to maximize their infl uence within the unipolar system, but 
such “soft balancing” will not fundamentally challenge the hegemon. 5
 Consequently, the leader of a unipolar system will encounter less overt opposition than a rising potential hegemon in a multipolar system. 
 Counterhegemonic balancing is especially unlikely if the most powerful 
nation is located further away from the other great powers than they are from 
one another. 6
 In such a scenario, “regional balancing dynamics are likely to 
kick in against the local major power much more reliably than the global 
counterbalance works against the [hegemon].” 7
 Regional powers may even 
compete with each other for the hegemon’s support, because geography 
makes the distant hegemon “the perfect ally”—one that is powerful enough 
to be of help, but remote enough not to constitute an overriding threat. 8
 
 The United States today possesses both of these characteristics: preponderant power and a remote geographic location. It is several times wealthier and more militarily powerful than any other state, and it is the only 
great power located in the Western Hemisphere whereas all of the other 
great powers are clumped together in Eurasia. 
 The United States is also an “extant” hegemon; it did not overturn the 
preexisting international order, instead the previous order collapsed around 
CHAPTER 5
100
it. When the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, the United States was suddenly left standing atop a Western liberal alliance system that already 
included most of the world’s strongest nations, many of whom had spent 
decades linking their militaries, economies, and foreign policy bureaucracies with those of the United States. 
 Since 1991, the United States has expanded the size and scope of the key 
institutions of this liberal order—most notably, NATO, the WTO, the World 
Bank, the IMF, and the UN—and prevented rival orders from emerging by 
squelching regional initiatives—for example, by making sure the EU does 
not replace NATO as Europe’s main defense organization—and maintaining a dominant military presence around the globe. 9
 For any nation, therefore, balancing against the United States would be a 
costly endeavor that would risk exclusion from the international community and require, at minimum, higher taxes to fi nance greater military 
spending. At a time of slow global growth, it is hard to imagine many foreign leaders being willing to stomach such costs. 
 Below, I illustrate this point by showing that balancing against the 
United States has been minimal since 1991 whereas bandwagoning has 
been widespread. I define balancing broadly as actions taken by states 
that increase their power relative to that of the United States. This 
expansive definition includes a variety of behaviors that come in three 
general forms: internal balancing, external balancing, and soft balancing. Internal balancing occurs when U.S. rivals build up their military 
capabilities. External balancing occurs when countries form alliances 
against the United States. Soft balancing involves the use of non-military 
tools (e.g. economic statecraft, diplomacy, cyber attacks) to undermine 
U.S. power. 
 internal balancing 
 Countries can engage in internal balancing in three main ways. The 
most extreme method would be for a country to try to become a military 
peer competitor of the United States and usher in a bipolar world order. 
The Soviet Union, for example, engaged in global balancing against the 
United States during the Cold War. Second, there is local balancing, in 
which a U.S. rival incrementally extends its defensive perimeter within its 
home region. Local balancing does not immediately alter the global distribution of power, but it lays the groundwork for future global balancing by 
helping a state carve out a sphere of infl uence near its homeland. Third, 
there is nuclear balancing, in which a state acquires nuclear weapons to 
blunt U.S. military superiority and deter the United States from attacking 
it. Below, I scour the empirical record for all three types of internal 
balancing. 
FUTURE PROSPECTS
101
 Global Balancing. According to MIT military expert Barry Posen, the 
foundation of U.S. hegemony is the U.S. “command of the global commons.” By “commons,” Posen is referring to international waters, outer 
space, and airspace above 15,000 feet. The United States “commands” these 
areas in the sense that the U.S. military enjoys almost total freedom of 
action there and can deny such freedom to other nations. Command of the 
commons allows the United States to project military power worldwide 
and coerce adversaries by threatening to cut them off from international 
shipping routes and communications networks. 
 Global balancing involves challenging U.S. command of the commons. 
To achieve this goal, Posen explains, a country would need to develop a 
large suite of power-projection platforms, including aircraft carriers; 
nuclear-powered attack submarines; guided-missile destroyers and cruisers; overseas military bases; fi ghter, heavy-lift, and airborne early warning 
and control (AEW&C) aircraft; and satellites and anti-satellite weapons. 
These platforms are expensive, so the clearest sign of global balancing 
would be a signifi cant increase in military spending. 
 Are countries engaging in global balancing against the United States? 
Since the 1990s, only two major powers—China and Russia—have signifi -
cantly increased their military spending, yet their defense budgets and 
power-projection arsenals still pale in comparison to those of the United 
States ( fi gure 5.1 and fi gure 5.2 ). 
 This persistent gap in military capabilities is historically unprecedented. 
In the nineteenth century, France, Russia, and Austria-Hungary quickly

balanced Britain, the hegemon of the era, by outspending it militarily. Similarly, the Soviet Union ramped up military spending and raised a huge 
army to balance the United States during the Cold War. The military investments of China and Russia today are consequential for security dynamics

near their homelands, but they do not compare to these past cases of global 
balancing ( fi gure 5.1 ). 
 Local Balancing. The U.S. dominates militarily at the global level, but 
China and Russia are working hard to shift the local military balances in 
their home regions. China’s local balancing efforts were discussed at length 
in chapter 4. What about Russia’s efforts? 
 Between 2007 and 2017, Russia doubled its military spending, invaded 
Georgia, annexed Crimea, incited an insurgency in eastern Ukraine, intervened militarily in Syria, harassed NATO warplanes, and threatened to use 
nuclear weapons if attacked by NATO. Some analysts portray these actions 
as savvy local balancing by a resurgent power. 10 On closer inspection, however, they look more like damage control by a declining power. 
 First, Russia’s recent hike in defense spending looks impressive only 
because it followed the two steepest peacetime declines in history: when 
the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia’s military spending dropped 75 percent 
(from $195 billion in 1990 to $42 billion in 1992); and then Russia cut military spending by an additional 65 percent between 1992 and 2000 (from $42 
billion to $15 billion). 11 Russian military spending did not return to 1992 
levels until 2009. 
 Although Russia’s defense spending surged to $70 billion in 2016, a 
quarter of these funds were used to pay outstanding debts to defense contractors, and another 20 percent was stolen by corrupt offi cials, so Russia’s actual military spending in recent years has hovered closer to early 
1990s levels (roughly $40 billion), which is fi fteen times less than what the 
United States spends. 12 Now that Russia’s economy is in free fall—
between 2013 and 2016, Russia’s GDP shrank by 40 percent—the Russian 
government is slashing defense spending again, cutting the budget by 7 
percent in 2017 (or 30 percent if the one-off payment to defense contractors is included in the 2016 budget) and another 5 percent in 2018. 13 The 
Russian government says it expects to make more cuts in the years 
ahead. 14 
 Second, Russia’s strategic gains in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria are mitigated by the fact that Russia intervened in each country in response to a 
strategic setback. Russia invaded Georgia after Georgian President Mikheil 
Saakashvili, who was fervently committed to getting his country into NATO, 
sent the Georgian army to reincorporate two majority-Russian regions, 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia invaded Ukraine after Ukraine’s proRussian president was ousted in a coup. And Russia intervened in Syria 
when the civil war there threatened to topple the regime of Bashar al-Assad, 
the caretaker of Russia’s main naval base on the Mediterranean. 
 Third, Russia is paying a price for its local balancing. After Russia 
invaded Ukraine in 2014, the United States, the EU, Japan, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, and several Eastern European countries imposed sanctions

on Russia that reduced its GDP by 1.5 percent that year and an additional 
9 percent in subsequent years. 15 Furthermore, by annexing Crimea, Russia 
removed the largest pro-Russian voting bloc from Ukraine’s electorate, 
thereby making it all but impossible for a pro-Russian leader to win a 
Ukrainian presidential election ever again. Russia also has to rebuild 
Crimea, a task that has already cost Russia more than $10 billion since 
2014. 16
 Most important, Russia’s actions have reinvigorated NATO, which 
responded to Russian aggression by increasing defense spending 4.3 percent, sending four multinational combat battalions to Poland and the Baltic 
states, establishing two new military commands to coordinate operations 
in the event of a war with Russia, increasing the number of exercises it carries out in central and eastern Europe, building infrastructure to surge reinforcements to eastern Europe, and ramping up its naval and air presence in 
the Baltic and Black Seas. 17 The United States has bolstered these efforts by 
sending 4,000 additional U.S. troops to Europe—the largest new American 
deployment there since the Cold War—and authorizing the sale of lethal 
weapons to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles. 18
 In sum, Russia has engaged in local balancing against the United States, 
but its efforts have been offset by fi scal constraints, strategic setbacks, and 
counterbalancing by NATO and the United States. 
 In the years ahead, however, Russia could pose serious problems for the 
United States in the Baltics, where Russia enjoys a local superiority of military force over three NATO members: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Collectively these tiny countries have 20,000 soldiers, 158 pieces of artillery, a 
few tanks and patrol vessels, and no aircraft. Their combined territory is 
roughly the size of Missouri and, to make matters worse, they are wedged 
between the Russian heartland and Kaliningrad, a fortifi ed Russian exclave. 19
Vladimir Putin has boasted that Russian forces could conquer the Baltic 
capitals in two days, and analyses by Western defense experts suggest that 
he was not embellishing by much. 20 Even if Russia never tries to conquer the 
Baltics, it could challenge NATO’s credibility by seizing a small plot of land 
in one of the Baltic States, thereby forcing NATO to choose between attacking ensconced Russian forces or abandoning a NATO member. 21 
 Russia has not yet carried out such an incursion—probably because it 
worries that NATO would honor its security guarantees to the Baltics and 
strike Russia with overwhelming force. 22 Russia also probably worries 
that the Baltic States would wage guerilla warfare in the event of a Russian invasion, replicating on a grand scale the punishment that a few 
thousand Chechen insurgents infl icted on Russian forces in Grozny, Chechnya’s capital, in 1994 and 1999. 23 In short, Russia is currently deterred 
from attacking the Baltics. The situation, however, is precarious and 
fraught with risks of inadvertent escalation. In chapter 6, I propose ways 
to minimize them. 
FUTURE PROSPECTS

 Nuclear Balancing. Only one country, North Korea, has developed a nuclear 
weapon since 1991. Meanwhile, four countries (Belarus, Kazakhstan, South 
Africa, and Ukraine) have dismantled their nuclear arsenals, and three other 
countries (Algeria, Romania, and Libya) have abandoned their nuclear 
weapons development programs. 24 The only other countries to pursue 
nuclear weapons since 1991 are Iran and Syria, and Iran agreed to suspend 
its program in 2016, and Syria has descended into civil war. 25 In short, there 
has only been one successful case of nuclear balancing in the unipolar era. 
 From an American perspective, of course, one new nuclear weapons state 
in thirty years is one too many. The United States has long been determined 
to prevent nuclear proliferation, and rightly so. The crisis currently brewing over North Korea’s nuclear arsenal poses the gravest threat to American security since the Cold War. No geopolitical issue scares me more. 
 As I discuss in chapter 6, however, there may be ways to defuse this crisis 
without going to war or sacrifi cing core U.S. interests. Moreover, North 
Korea’s nuclear success should not obscure the “great proliferation slowdown” that has occurred since 1991. 26 During the Cold War, nine countries 
acquired nuclear weapons in quick succession, and U.S. intelligence agencies predicted that dozens more would go nuclear. 27 Those predictions did 
not come to pass, partly because nuclear weapons are diffi cult to build and 
partly because the United States imposes severe costs on nuclear aspirants—
in the last two decades alone, it has invaded Iraq, orchestrated multinational 
embargos on Iran and North Korea, and bombed Libya. 28 The U.S. government shows no sign of abandoning its aggressive counterproliferation policies. As a result, nuclear balancing will likely remain rare. 
 external balancing 
 The same can be said for external balancing. No countries have formed 
an alliance against the United States, while sixty-eight countries have formally allied with the United States, and dozens more have formed defense 
partnerships with it. The U.S. alliance network encompasses 25 percent of 
the earth’s population and accounts for 75 percent of world GDP and 
defense spending. 29 No major power in history has had so many partners. 
Russia today maintains only a few defense agreements with some former 
Soviet states, and China’s only ally is North Korea ( fi gure 5.3 ). 
 The absence of anti-American alliances is especially remarkable, 
because the United States has gone out of its way to antagonize other 
nations. It stations dominant military forces in every region and uses force 
frequently, engaging in more than sixty militarized confl icts between 1991 
and 2018. 30 The 2003 invasion of Iraq was particularly galling to other 
nations, and many scholars predicted it would spark serious balancing 
against the United States. 31 Yet no countries abrogated their alliances 
with the United States or formed alliances against it. Instead, thirty-nine 
CHAPTER 5
106
countries joined the U.S. coalition against Iraq, contributing 50,000 troops 
for the invasion and 20,000 troops and $15 billion for postconfl ict stabilization operations. 32 Russia and China blocked UN authorization for the 
invasion, but did not challenge U.S. operations once underway. 33 Notably, 
thirty-fi ve of Russia and China’s forty-one neighbors contributed to the 
U.S. war effort. 34 
 Looking ahead, there are only two coalitions that could muster the 
strength to challenge American primacy: a central Eurasian alliance 
anchored by Russia and China; or a Western European superstate built on 
the bones of the EU. Neither coalition, however, is likely to emerge. A 
central Eurasian coalition would require Russia and China to put aside 
their long-standing rivalry and subdue Japan in the east, NATO in the 
west, and India in the south. A Western European coalition on the other 
hand would require Britain to rejoin the EU, France and Britain to share 
their nuclear forces with Germany, and Russia to accept an EU superarmy 
on its doorstep. 
 Russia and China currently maintain a “strategic partnership,” but this 
relationship is unlikely to become a genuine alliance, because the two countries share a 2,600-mile border and a desire to dominate Eurasia—a goal 
that one side can accomplish only by subjugating the other. Perhaps a 
shared hatred of the United States will bring Russia and China together, but 
history suggests otherwise. 35 At the start of the Cold War, China initially 
aligned with the Soviet Union, but by the 1960s the two Communist

powers were literally at war with each other, and in the 1970s China offi -
cially switched sides and aligned with the United States. 36
 Today, many Russian and Chinese strategists warn their respective governments not to place too much faith in a sustainable partnership. 37 Foreign 
analysts come to similar conclusions. As one study explains: “[SinoRussian] cooperation is limited to areas where their interests already overlap, like bolstering trade. In the parts of the world that matter most to them, 
Russia and China are more rivals than allies.” 38
 For every example of Sino-Russian cooperation, there is a counterexample 
of competition. For instance, Russia sells weapons to China, but it recently 
reduced sales to China while increasing sales to China’s rivals, most notably 
India and Vietnam. 39 Russia and China conduct joint military exercises, but 
they also train with each other’s enemies and conduct unilateral exercises 
simulating a Sino-Russian war. 40 The two countries share an interest in developing Central Asia, but Russia wants to tether the region to Moscow via the 
Eurasian Economic Union whereas China wants to reconstitute the Silk Road 
and link China to the Middle East and Europe while bypassing Russia. 41 Collectively, these confl icting interests have placed Russia and China “on a trajectory toward intensifying competition from latent to emergent rivalry.” 42 
 What of the EU, the other potential anti-U.S. coalition? Since 1998, EU 
member states have developed a Common European Security and Defense 
Policy (CSDP) and raised a “rapid reaction force” of 60,000 troops and eighteen 1,500-troop “battle groups.” Some scholars characterize these developments as balancing against the United States. 43 But EU nations have devoted 
less than 1 percent of their military manpower to the CSDP, far less than they 
contribute to the U.S-led NATO alliance; the EU battle groups have never 
been deployed; and all of the missions undertaken under the CSDP have 
been small peacekeeping missions involving an average of 3,000 troops. 44 
 In 2017, the EU announced a new initiative—the Permanent Structured 
Cooperation (PESCO)—that committed members to increase defense 
spending and improve the bloc’s ability to project power in hot spots near 
Europe. The initiative, however, is unlikely to offset the damage done by 
Britain’s exit from the EU, given that Britain accounted for a quarter of EU 
defense spending and half of EU military R&D spending. 45
 soft balancing 
 Soft balancing—the use of non-military tools to shift the balance of 
power—comes in two main varieties: economic and political. Economic 
soft balancing entails the use of economic tools, such as sanctions, cyber 
attacks, espionage, and exclusionary economic blocs. Political soft balancing, on the other hand, occurs when foreign powers meddle in U.S. domestic politics or manipulate global public opinion to enhance their image or 
sully the reputation of the United States. 
CHAPTER 5
108
 Economic Soft Balancing. The United States has almost never been sanctioned during the post–Cold War era, but it has sanctioned other countries 
forty-six times, accounting for nearly 60 percent of all cases of economic 
sanctions imposed since 1991. 46 According to a recent study, U.S. sanctions 
succeeded in coercing the target state to comply with American demands in 
more than 40 percent of these cases. 47
 The United States is uniquely empowered to impose economic sanctions because it plays a central role in global shipping and banking: the 
U.S. Navy can intercept shipping almost anywhere in international 
waters; 48 and the U.S. dollar is used in 80 percent of all fi nancial 
transactions worldwide. 49 Most dollar-denominated transactions cross 
the American fi nancial system, so the U.S. government has ample 
opportunities to manipulate or freeze the transactions and assets of hostile countries. 50 
 Furthermore, when the United States imposes sanctions, it often gets its 
wealthy allies to help out. In some cases, therefore, the United States has 
been able to cut hostile regimes off from hard currency, fi nancial credit, 
vital imports, and access to assets in North America, Western Europe, Oceania, and parts of East Asia. 51 For example, after Russia invaded Ukraine in 
2014, the United States, the EU, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada 
froze Russian assets on their territory, prohibited their banks from conducting transactions with Russian entities, banned top Russian leaders and 
businesspeople from traveling to their countries, and cut Russia off from 
advanced technology imports. The multinational sanctions imposed on 
Iran from 2006 to 2016 were even more onerous, amounting to an almost 
total economic embargo on the country. 
 Instead of sanctioning the United States, and inviting economically devastating retaliation, rival powers have focused their economic ire on America’s allies. Russia, for example, has manipulated oil and gas prices at least 
fi fteen times since 1991 to coerce countries in central and eastern Europe. 52
On three of these occasions, Russia targeted NATO members: Lithuania in 
2006, and Poland and Slovakia in 2014. 53
 China, too, has sanctioned several U.S. allies during the past decade, 
banning rare earth metal exports to Japan in 2010 during a dispute over 
the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands; salmon imports from Norway after the 
Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese 
dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010; banana imports from the Philippines during 
a standoff over Scarborough Shoal in 2012; and visas for some South 
Korean celebrities, businesspeople, and tourists after Seoul decided to 
deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense 
system in 2017. 54 
 Some of these sanctions arguably weakened the United States by cowing 
its allies into concessions. Norway, for example, released a statement in 2016 
promising to “fully respect China’s sovereignty . . . and core interests”; 55 and 
FUTURE PROSPECTS
109
the Philippines has downplayed the 2016 world court ruling it won against 
China’s territorial claims, canceled some military exercises with the United 
States, and halted construction on a sandbar in a disputed area of the South 
China Sea. 56 
 In most cases, however, China and Russia’s sanctions have not signifi -
cantly improved their strategic situations. The United States offset Russian 
gas sanctions by shipping American natural gas to allies in eastern Europe. 57
Japan responded to China’s sanctions by reasserting its claims in the East 
China Sea, bolstering its military, and reducing its reliance on Chinese rare 
earths. 58 The Philippines still occupies Chinese-claimed portions of the 
South China Sea and is allowing the United States to expand and upgrade 
its military bases on Filipino territory. 59 And South Korea deployed THAAD 
in September 2017. 60
 Given their limited ability to impose sanctions, U.S. adversaries have 
sought other ways to chip away at American wealth and power. An increasingly common approach is cyber warfare. American organizations and 
businesses have been the targets in roughly 40 percent of all publicly known 
state-sponsored cyber attacks and intrusions worldwide since 2005. 61 The 
majority of these attacks were carried out by China, Russia, Iran, or North 
Korea and involved espionage, data destruction, service denials, or all of 
the above. It is diffi cult to calculate the costs these attacks have imposed on 
the United States, but estimates range from $8.5 billion per year to $400 billion per year if all of the potential long-term losses from espionage are 
included. 62
 America’s rivals also are soft balancing against the United States by 
developing alternatives to the liberal economic order. 63 China and Russia, 
for example, are promoting an international basket of currencies to replace 
the dollar as the world’s reserve currency and a new international fi nancial 
transaction system to provide an alternative to the Society for Worldwide 
Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system, which the United 
States and its allies have used to cut foreign leaders and their cronies off 
from assets abroad. 
 Other examples of soft balancing include China’s founding of the Asian 
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which could dilute U.S. economic 
infl uence by providing poor countries with fi nancial alternatives to the 
World Bank and IMF, where the United States controls three times the voting shares of any other country. China also is negotiating with at least sixteen countries to form a free-trade zone, the Regional Comprehensive 
Economic Partnership (RCEP), which would exclude the United States and 
create the world’s largest trading bloc by population. Finally, China’s Belt 
and Road initiative—which aims to provide $1 trillion in loans for infrastructure projects in sixty-nine countries, mostly in Central, South, and 
Southeast Asia—could create a Chinese-centric economic order in the center of Eurasia. 
CHAPTER 5
110
 Time will tell whether these initiatives diminish American power. At 
present, each faces obstacles. The dollar has only become more dominant as 
a global currency since the 2008 fi nancial crisis. 64 China and Russia have 
found few takers for their SWIFT alternatives. China’s ability to direct the 
operations of the AIIB is limited, because other countries control 75 percent 
of the voting shares, the bank has to raise capital from international fi nancial markets, and many of the bank’s projects are co-sponsored by the 
World Bank. 65 RCEP negotiations are two years behind schedule and, as of 
early 2018, are being held up by India. 66 India also is boycotting China’s 
Belt and Road initiative; Japan and Russia are pushing alternative schemes; 
and according to the Chinese government, roughly half of the participants 
in Belt and Road will not be able to repay the loans they plan to take from 
China, so when those loans come due next decade, China either will have 
to write off hundreds of billions of dollars in losses or try to seize assets in 
participating countries, as it recently did in Sri Lanka—hardly a great way 
to win friends or persuade countries to abandon the liberal order for a 
Chinese-dominated one. 67
 Political Soft Balancing. Some authoritarian nations—most notably China 
and Russia and, to a lesser extent, Iran—are spending billions of dollars on 
an “antidemocratic toolkit” of NGOs, media outlets, think tanks, hackers, 
and bribes. 68 Their main aim is not to win hearts and minds, but to reverse 
the international spread of democracy, destroy America’s image abroad, 
and subvert American political institutions. 69
 Such political soft balancing, which the National Endowment for Democracy calls sharp power, comes in various forms. 70 The most direct approach 
involves meddling in the domestic politics of the United States and its 
allies. For example, Chinese agents have tried to bribe politicians in Australia, Germany, Britain, and the United States to get them to endorse China’s 
positions on territorial disputes, trade, and human rights. 71 Russia has 
interfered in the elections of at least twenty-seven Western countries since 
2004—most infamously in the 2016 U.S. presidential election—by stealing 
and releasing compromising emails, hacking voting machines, and spreading fake news using a network of social media trolls and bots. 72 In a nightmare scenario, such meddling could enable foreign powers to manipulate 
American policy by getting Manchurian candidates elected. In fact, some 
commentators think Russia already accomplished this goal by swinging the 
2016 presidential election for Donald Trump. 73
 Americans are rightly concerned about foreign meddling, but they can 
take some solace in the fact that leaders installed by a foreign power rarely 
behave as loyal puppets; most get checked by other political actors or simply go rogue and brush off the demands of their foreign backer—a phenomenon the United States experienced fi rst-hand during the Cold War 
when some of its proxies in Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast 
FUTURE PROSPECTS
111
Asia gave American policymakers the cold shoulder. 74 The Trump case also 
illustrates the diffi culty of coopting a democracy: even if President Trump 
is a Russian puppet, and Russian meddling won him the election—both of 
which are debatable points—the political backlash incited by Russia’s 
actions has turned U.S. policy further against Russia, resulting in more 
sanctions on Russian elites and more NATO troops near Russia’s borders. 
 A more likely harm of foreign meddling is that it undermines Americans’ 
trust in their own government. In 2017, only 18 percent of Americans said 
they trusted their government to do what is right always or most of the time. 75
This lack of faith may have more to do with domestic failures than foreign 
meddling—public trust in government has hovered around 20 percent since 
the 2008 fi nancial crisis, which occurred before Russian and Chinese infl uence 
activities kicked into high gear—but foreign meddling certainly has not 
helped and could prove devastating in the future. Imagine, for example, the 
pandemonium that might erupt in American society if foreign hackers successfully sabotaged voting machines during a close election. 76 
 Even if such a dramatic outcome never occurs, countries can balance 
against the United States by waging what Chinese president Xi Jinping 
calls a “discourse war” ( huayu zhanzheng) . China, for example, is spending 
$10 billion a year to promote pro-China views abroad; by comparison, the 
U.S. government only spends $670 million on foreign outreach. 77 Some of 
China’s image-building initiatives are harmless (e.g. sponsoring Chinese 
new year celebrations around the world), but others are blatant attempts 
to stifl e Western criticism of China. For example, the Chinese government 
has pressured Western publishers to censor articles and books on sensitive 
subjects, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre and unrest in Hong 
Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet. In 2017, two Western academic publishers, 
Springer and Cambridge University Press, caved to China’s demands and 
removed objectionable content from their databases in China, though 
Cambridge eventually reinstated the content following furious criticism in 
the West. 78 
 China also has tried to inject Chinese propaganda into Western public 
discourse. For example, in 2015, American reporters discovered that China 
Radio International, a state media company, had covertly sponsored at least 
thirty-three pro-China radio stations in fourteen countries, including the 
United States. 79 China Daily, the Chinese government’s main Englishlanguage mouthpiece, fl oods the streets of American cities with free newspapers and pays for inserts in major American papers, such as the Washington 
Post and the Wall Street Journal.80 Since 2004 China has established more 
than fi ve hundred government-funded “Confucius Institutes” in 140 countries, including more than one hundred institutes in American universities. 
These institutes ostensibly teach Chinese language and culture, but some 
scholars accuse them of trying to censor research and teaching (full disclosure: my university hosts a Confucius Institute, but it has never contacted 
CHAPTER 5
112
me about my research, much less pressured me to adopt certain views, and 
this book is hardly fl attering to China). 81
 Russia has sponsored similar initiatives. In recent years, it has created a 
global television network called Russia Today (RT), established think tanks 
in Washington, D.C., hired journalists to submit content to American periodicals and websites, and created fake personas to post comments on social 
media. 82 These outlets relentlessly beat home a pro-Russian, anti-American, 
message. According to Liz Wahl, a former RT news anchor who left the station in protest over its biased coverage, the “basic principle” to which RT 
stories “must conform” is: “make the U.S. and the West look bad.” 83
 Have these efforts eroded America’s standing abroad? It is diffi cult to 
say. The share of the world’s population that approves of the United States 
declined from 64 percent in 2016 to 49 percent in 2017, but this sudden drop 
probably had more to do with the election of Donald Trump, a historically 
unpopular president, than Chinese or Russian infl uence activities. 84 As of 
early 2018, America’s foreign approval rating remains higher than it was 
under President George W. Bush and higher than China or Russia’s. 85
 Perhaps China and Russia’s machinations will eventually even the score, 
but this outcome is far from guaranteed, because the United States is fi ghting back. As Dartmouth scholars Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth 
have shown, “the United States is clearly the world’s number one soft balancer.” 86 It hosts think tanks that promote an American world view and 
funds media and pro-democracy groups—such as the National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, the Ford Foundation, the Asia Foundation, Voice of America, and Radio Free Europe and Asia—that shelter 
Chinese and Russian dissidents and journalists, name and shame China 
and Russia’s human rights violations, and support democratic movements 
in both countries’ backyards. These actions build on a long American legacy of meddling in other countries’ internal affairs. 87 During the Cold War, 
the United States launched at least seventy-two political operations to 
coopt or destabilize foreign regimes, sixty-six of which were carried out 
covertly. 88 It is unclear how many political operations the United States 
runs today, but investigative studies found evidence of covert programs in 
Libya in 2011 and Syria in 2012. 89
 Most important, America’s civil society—everything from its highly successful companies and foundations to its world-class universities and 
trendsetting pop culture—radiates soft power and helps the United States 
attract foreign partners. 90 By contrast, China and Russia’s stodgy statedirected charm offensives lack genuine appeal. 91 China’s efforts have made 
it more popular in Africa, mainly because China has poured money into 
stadiums and other infrastructure there. But China and Russia have not 
been able to buy much love abroad. According to a widely cited international soft power index, the United States ranks third from the top whereas 
Russia and China rank fi fth and sixth from the bottom respectively. 92
FUTURE PROSPECTS
113
 Net Assessment. To sum up, balancing against the United States has been 
limited since the end of the Cold War. North Korea has acquired nuclear 
weapons, and Russia and China have engaged in local military balancing 
and soft balancing. Yet no countries have seriously challenged U.S. command of the global commons or formed anti-American alliances. 
 The United States thus operates in a relatively permissive international 
environment. This environment is not free of threats to U.S. security, but the 
United States faces fewer and smaller direct challenges to its hegemonic 
position than did past lead powers. These trends, along with a large body 
of international relations theory, suggest that full-blown balancing against 
the United States will not reemerge until other countries narrow the gap in 
power resources between themselves and the United States. The fate of unipolarity thus depends on the other major driver of international change: 
economic convergence. 
 Convergence Theory: Underspecifi ed 
 As Yale Historian Paul Kennedy has shown, the rise and fall of the great 
powers is largely the result of “differentials in growth rates and technological change, leading to shifts in the global economic balances, which 
in turn gradually impinge upon the political and military balances.” 93
The question is: Why do some countries, at some times, grow faster than 
others? 
 To answer this question, international relations scholars have borrowed 
an old idea from economics—convergence theory—that holds that poor 
countries tend to grow faster than rich countries. 94 The reason, according to 
the theory, is that poor countries enjoy the “advantages of backwardness”: 
they can copy or steal the latest technologies from rich countries without 
paying the costs to invent them; and they can engage in “cost innovation,” 
mass-producing advanced technologies at a fraction of the price of rich 
countries, because they have lower labor and input costs. 95
 Given these advantages, poor countries eventually move “from imitation 
to innovation” and “leap-frog” up the value chain by mastering and improving on foreign technologies. 96 Meanwhile, rich countries suffer declining 
rates of profi ts, rising wages, and the exhaustion of resources, all of which 
encourage investment to migrate to greener pastures in emerging markets. 
As two prominent economists conclude: “For poor countries with large 
young populations, growing fast should be easy: open up, create some form 
of market economy, invest in human and physical capital, don’t be unlucky 
and don’t blow it. Catch-up and convergence should do the rest.” 97 
 The main implication of convergence theory for world politics is that rising challengers inevitably overtake reigning hegemons. As Princeton political economist Robert Gilpin explains: “With lower costs and equivalent 
CHAPTER 5
114
technology, backward societies frequently can outcompete the more affl uent advanced society economically and militarily” and thereby catalyze “a 
fundamental redistribution of power in the system.” 98
 Yet convergence theory is not an iron law of history. At best, it is a conditional hypothesis that confronts several inconvenient facts. 
 First, rich countries have grown faster than poor countries during seventeen of the past twenty decades. 99 In other words, divergence has been “the 
dominant feature of modern economic history.” 100 Poor countries have 
grown faster than rich countries since the early 2000s, but the trends are 
turning back the other way, and many economists now worry that poor 
countries’ recent growth spurts stemmed from ephemeral factors (cheap 
capital, low interest rates, and high commodity prices) that are disappearing, potentially for good. 101
 Second, the wealth gap separating rich and poor nations has expanded 
steadily over the past two hundred years. The gap in ratios of per capita GDP 
between rich and poor countries has narrowed slightly since 2000, but remains 
as wide as it was in the 1970s and greater than during the height of the imperialist era in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Few nations have 
gone from rags to riches. Besides oil states and trading entrepô ts, like Hong 
Kong and Singapore, the only success stories are Japan, South Korea and 
Taiwan—all three of which had the good fortune to develop during the 
Cold War, when the United States lavished money, technology, and trade 
privileges on its partners because it needed strong anticommunist allies. 102 
 Third, the economic trajectories of less-developed countries have varied 
tremendously: a few have converged rapidly with rich countries, others 
have fallen further behind, and most have had a mixed experience of “takeoffs, stalls and nose dives.” 103 Asian economies have been the main success 
stories—Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have become rich; and 
China and India have grown rapidly since the 1990s, albeit from a low 
base—but bursts of growth in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East 
have fi zzled. 
 Fourth, the trends highlighted above hold even if we focus solely on 
great powers. For every case of great power convergence, there have been 
many more cases of divergence. 104 For example, Germany, Japan, and the 
United States rose relative to Britain in the late nineteenth century; but 
Austria-Hungary, France, Russia, China, India, and the Ottoman Empire 
fell further behind. During the second half of the twentieth century, Japan 
rose relative to the United States; the Soviet Union, France, Britain, China, 
and India not so much. 
 In sum, convergence is “anything but automatic.” 105 Superpowers are not 
doomed to decline, and developing countries are not destined to rise. There 
may be advantages to backwardness, but there are also considerable disadvantages, including a lack of capital, skilled labor, know-how, market share, 
and brand recognition. 106
FUTURE PROSPECTS
115
 Convergence theory, therefore, is underspecifi ed. The likelihood of catchup growth depends on a set of factors that, so far, have not been incorporated into theories of international change. Fortunately, economists have 
been hard at work identifying these growth ingredients. The next section 
highlights the three most important factors. 
 Sources of Growth 
 Abraham Lincoln supposedly said that a nation’s strength stems from its 
land, laws, and people. 107 It turns out Lincoln was right. According to a 
voluminous literature in economics, the three main factors driving longterm economic growth are geography, political institutions, and demography. None of these factors is necessary for growth; some countries have 
grown rapidly in spite of having bad geography, institutions, or demography. Moreover, economists do not agree about which factor matters most. 
Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence that each factor shapes the 
probability of economic growth over periods of several decades. Below, I 
discuss each in turn. 
 geography 
 In international politics, as in real estate, location matters. The ideal location for wealth-creation is one with an abundance of exploitable energy 
resources, transport infrastructure, and protective buffers. 108
 Exploitable Energy Resources. There is substantial evidence linking the 
rise of great powers to exploitable energy resources. 109 Britain, for example, surged ahead of other countries in the early nineteenth century in 
part because its major cities happened to be located near massive coal 
deposits, a stroke of luck that spurred widespread adoption of machines 
that obliterated previous limits on transportation and industry. 110 By the 
1800s, English coal was yielding as much energy as could be generated by 
6 million horses, 11 million acres of fi rewood, or 40 million men (who 
would have eaten more than three times Britain’s entire wheat output). 111
Similarly, the United States rose rapidly in the late nineteenth century by 
pioneering the exploitation of oil, which fueled the “American system” of 
mass manufacturing that made the United States the wealthiest nation in 
the world. 112 
 Today, most natural resources are sold on global markets, and many 
countries are developing renewable sources of energy. Nevertheless, renewable energy only accounts for 3 percent of world energy consumption, and 
studies still fi nd a signifi cant positive relationship between exploitable fossil fuel reserves and wealth. 113 Among countries in the top three energy 
CHAPTER 5
116
quintiles (as measured by energy reserves per capita) only 6 percent are 
poor; by contrast, 58 percent of the countries in the bottom two energy 
quintiles are poor. 114
 Of course, countries that depend heavily on resource exports for growth 
may suffer recurrent economic busts because of sudden drops in global 
commodity prices. Moreover, resources can cripple growth by fueling corruption, undermining the rule of law, or increasing the likelihood of civil 
war. 115 
 Yet there is no guaranteed “resource curse.” 116 Norway, a major oil producer, ranks near the top of the international tables for governance and economic performance; the most recent major study on the issue fi nds that 
resource wealth may actually facilitate democratic development; 117 and 
many other studies fi nd that resources fuel growth, as long as a country has 
a diversifi ed economy, consolidated democratic political institutions, or 
both. 118
 Transport Infrastructure. Countries with natural transport infrastructure, namely navigable rivers and deepwater harbors, enjoy an economic advantage over landlocked countries, because moving goods 
over land is forty to seventy times more expensive than over water. 119
For example, in the United States, semitrailer trucks transport goods for 
roughly $2.40 per mile whereas modern container ships transport goods 
for roughly 17 cents per mile; 120 and maintenance of U.S. highways costs 
$160 billion per year whereas maintenance for all U.S. waterways cost 
$2.7 billion. 121 Countries that have navigable rivers and natural harbors 
thus save vast sums of money that would otherwise have been spent 
lugging goods over land and building and maintaining roads, railways, 
and ports. 
 In addition, a country with many navigable rivers connected to ocean 
harbors is more likely to participate in world trade and have a fl ourishing 
domestic market. 122 When goods can easily reach many locations within a 
country, regions within the country can specialize and reap the gains of 
trade. The result is a large and diversifi ed consumer market. The political 
philosopher Adam Smith made this point centuries ago: “As by means of 
water-carriage a more extensive market is opened to every sort of industry 
than what land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is upon sea-coast, and 
along the banks of navigable rivers, that industry of every kind naturally 
begins to subdivide and improve itself, and it is frequently not till a long 
time after that those improvements extend themselves to the inland part of 
the country.” 123
 The correlation between waterways and wealth is striking. The four most 
prosperous economic zones in the world—Western Europe, northeast Asia 
(coastal China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea), and the eastern and western seaboards of the United States and Canada—contain most of the world’s 
FUTURE PROSPECTS
117
natural harbors and navigable rivers. 124 By contrast, nearly all of the world’s 
dry and landlocked countries are poor. 125 This pattern repeats itself within 
countries: the most prosperous regions in most nations are located near 
waterways. 126 The pattern also holds for the great powers; for instance, 
detailed case studies have linked the economic dynamism and outsized 
international infl uence of the Dutch Republic, Britain, the United States, 
and Germany to their waterway networks. 127
 Buffers. A good location is a secure location. Countries that are surrounded by powerful enemies tend to fi ght more wars and maintain larger 
armies. 128 Such militarization drains resources and scares off investment. 129
Countries that have natural buffers (e.g., bodies of water, mountains, or 
weak neighbors) separating them from powerful rivals not only have more 
money to invest in their economies, but also enjoy cheaper access to fi nance 
because lenders view them as safe havens. 130 The ideal buffer is a body of 
water, because it provides protection from enemies in wartime but facilitates international trade in peacetime. 131
 institutions 
 Just as a computer needs a sleek operating system to run effi ciently, an 
economy needs to be governed by clean and capable institutions to prosper. 
A good government is strong but limited; it enforces laws and provides 
public services, but is constrained by rules that ensure that it acts in the 
interests of the community. 132 A state without constraints is a tyranny, and a 
nation without a state is anarchical. The ideal government therefore strikes 
a balance between order and accountability; it has the capacity to enforce 
laws and get things done, but it remains accountable to society and treats 
people equally on the basis of citizenship rather than on their political 
connections. 
 Capacity. The idea that state capacity is vital for economic development 
has a long lineage dating back at least to the writings of Thomas Hobbes 
and Max Weber. The argument attracted signifi cant attention in the 1980s 
and 1990s as a consequence of the “East Asian Miracle,” when scholars 
noticed that the Asian countries that became rich—Japan, Taiwan, South 
Korea Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore—were run by strong “developmental states.” 133 Conversely, other studies have linked the economic failure of African and Latin American nations to state weakness. 134 Crossnational and subnational studies bolster these fi ndings, showing that 
countries and regions with higher per capita tax revenues (a crude proxy 
for state capacity) and better scores on indexes of state capacity tend to be 
wealthier. 135 In sum, there is a large literature supporting the rather intuitive argument that nations need governments with the capacity to maintain 
CHAPTER 5
118
order, regulate economic activity, and provide public services in order to 
grow economically. 
 Accountability. Dictatorships may be able to engineer growth during 
early stages of development—the Soviet Union, for example, achieved some 
of the highest growth rates in the world in the 1950s by shoving peasants into 
factories and channeling investment into strategic industries 136 —but in the 
long-run, checks on executive power are vital to sustain growth. 137 Such constraints not only reduce corruption, but also help secure private property 
rights. Property rights, in turn, foster entrepreneurship and innovation, 
because people are more likely to start new businesses and engage in R&D if 
they believe that the fruits of their labor will be protected and respected by 
the state. 138 
 It may seem logical to equate democracy with accountability, and authoritarianism with corruption, but some authoritarian regimes have become 
rich (e.g., Singapore today or Imperial Germany in the early twentieth century), and many democracies are economic basket cases. Most countries in 
Latin America, for example, are nominally democratic, yet the region’s 
average per capita income is less than $8,000 in real terms. Similarly, there 
are sixteen democracies in Africa, but their average per capita income is 
$2,500. 139
 The large number of poor democracies shows that the key to growth is 
not elections per se, but rather constraints on government elites. These constraints can be imposed by a variety of political counterweights, including 
noble lords, local governments, business groups, religious movements, or 
cultural norms. Regular elections might be the most reliable means of 
checking tyranny and corruption, but they are no guarantee. Voters may 
fail to hold leaders accountable due to ignorance, ethnic ties, or elite manipulation; and leaders may run for offi ce not to pursue a vision of the public 
good, but to enrich themselves. 140
 Given these limitations of democracy, most economists measure accountability in terms of the number of constraints on the executive, the level of 
expropriation risk faced by private investors, or the degree of voice and 
accountability in countries. 141 These indicators are not perfect; most are 
based on surveys of “experts” at international organizations and political 
risk fi rms, many of whom may be biased in favor of liberal democratic 
institutions. 142 Nevertheless, there is a clear correlation between these measures and wealth: the countries with the most constraints on the executive, 
the lowest expropriation risk for private investors, and the highest scores 
on governance indexes are, with few exceptions, the richest countries in the 
world. 143
 Such correlations, of course, do not prove that accountable institutions 
cause economic growth. There could be reverse causation—perhaps as 
countries become wealthy they develop checks on executive power. 144
FUTURE PROSPECTS
119
Another possibility is that unobserved factors, such as geography or culture, determine both a country’s level of economic development and the 
nature of its political institutions. 
 Rigorous studies, however, have addressed these issues by using natural 
experiments (for example, comparing the institutional and economic experiences of North and South Korea or East and West Germany), 145 instrumental variables, 146 and subnational variation. 147 This literature has 
produced a massive body of evidence showing that accountable institutions dramatically improve a country’s prospects for sustaining long-term 
economic growth. For example, the most recent study in this line of work 
shows that when a country democratizes, its GDP per capita rises by an 
additional 20 percent over the following thirty years. 148
 demography 
 Countries with populations that are big, young, and educated are primed 
for economic growth. 149 Big populations support large labor forces and 
domestic markets, young populations can work hard, and educated populations can work effi ciently and invent new technologies. 
 Size. Population surges do not always spur economic growth, but they 
often do. Germany and the United States, for example, grew rapidly in the 
late nineteenth century in part because of rapid population growth, which 
Germany achieved by unifying several smaller states and the United States 
achieved through immigration. 150
 Age. As noted in earlier chapters, a large population can be a burden if it 
is not productive. To grow, countries need young workers, not geriatrics. 
Not surprisingly, there is considerable evidence linking so-called demographic dividends, in which the working-age population grows faster than 
the population of retirees, to economic growth. For example, demographic 
dividends accounted for roughly one-third of the Soviet Union’s rapid 
growth in the 1950s, the East Asian tigers’ growth in the 1960s and 1970s, 
and China and India’s growth in the 1990s and 2000s. 151
 These are not isolated examples. Among the fi fty-six cases since 1960 of a 
country growing its economy 6 percent annually for a decade or more, the 
working-age population grew on average at 2.7 percent, a fi nding that suggests that the rise in number of workers did much of the heavy lifting to 
produce these economic miracles. 152 By contrast, countries with declining 
working-age populations have found it nearly impossible to sustain economic growth. On average, for every 1-percentage-point decline in a country’s population growth rate, the country loses a percentage point of 
GDP growth. 153 Among the thirty-eight of cases since 1960 of countries 
with declining working-age populations, the average GDP growth rate was 
CHAPTER 5
120
1.5 percent. 154 Only three of these countries grew their economies at or 
above 6 percent annually, and all of them were small countries recovering 
from domestic instability: Portugal in the 1960s and Belarus and Georgia 
between 2000 and 2010. 155
 Education. Productivity depends not only on youth but also on smarts. 
Countries with weak education systems can purchase or steal advanced 
technologies and methods from abroad, but they may lack the knowledge or “absorptive capacity” necessary to use them. 156 For that reason, 
studies suggest that differences in educational attainment and quality 
account for 20 to 35 percent of the variation in per capita wealth among 
countries and across regions within countries. 157 Similarly, historical 
studies suggest that the expansion of education systems in Germany in 
the late nineteenth century and in the United States in the twentieth century added roughly a third of a percentage point to GDP growth annually in each case. 158 
 Future Prospects of Today’s Great Powers 
 Having identifi ed the main drivers of long-term growth, I now use indicators of each to assess the future prospects of the eight most powerful countries in the world, by which I mean the countries that currently possess the 
largest stocks of economic and military resources: the United States, China, 
Russia, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and India. 
 geography 
 Exploitable Energy Resources. The United States recently became the world’s 
largest producer of oil and natural gas, bringing up more oil than Saudi 
Arabia and more natural gas than Russia. 159 According to the three most 
widely cited projections of world energy production, the United States will 
become a net energy exporter by 2030 and perhaps as early as 2022. 160 This 
development is due to the fact that the United States is the only nation 
exploiting large quantities of shale oil and natural gas. 161
 China remains the world’s largest coal producer, but coal is not as valuable as oil and gas because it is harder to transport, releases more particulate matter, and cannot be used to power most vehicles. For those reasons, 
the United States does not produce as much coal as China despite having 
more than twice the reserves. 
 Russia has larger natural gas reserves than the United States, but the 
Russian economy is overly dependent on resource rents—hydrocarbons 
contribute 60 to 70 percent of Russia’s federal budget and two-thirds of its 
exports. 162 Whereas the United States has large energy reserves and a 
FUTURE PROSPECTS
121
diversifi ed economy, Russia suffers from what economists call “Dutch 
disease,” meaning an overreliance on commodity exports that fuels corruption and starves other sectors of investment. 163 Russia’s overreliance 
on hydrocarbon exports also generates boom-bust cycles that wreak 
havoc on the economy. For example, when the oil price plunged from 
$147 to $50 per barrel between 2008 and 2009, Russia’s economy shrank 
20 percent. 164 
 China, Russia, and France have large shale reserves, but they are unlikely 
to tap them in large quantities soon, if ever. 165 The International Energy 
Agency predicts that China will extract less than 0.1 million barrels of shale 
oil and one-quarter of a million barrels of oil per day from coal in 2035—an 
amount equal to just 3 percent of China’s current oil consumption. 166 France 
has banned fracking entirely, partly because its best shale fi eld lies directly 
under Paris. And Russia’s decrepit energy giant Rosneft lacks the technology to tap the country’s vast reserves. 167
 The main reason the shale revolution has been an American phenomenon, besides the fact that U.S. shale fi elds happen to be located near 
major refi ning centers, is that the United States, unlike other countries, 
has a legal system that enshrines private ownership of land and the 
resources below it. 168 In America, any company can strike a deal with a 
landowner to lease the rights to the resources beneath his or her land. 
Consequently, the United States has more than 22,000 independent oil 
and gas companies competing vigorously for drilling rights, market 
share, and technological breakthroughs. 169 In the rest of the world, by 
contrast, mineral rights are owned or controlled by the government, and 
energy resources are managed by state-owned monopolies, which face 
no competitive pressure to explore new sources or adopt new technologies. In Russia, for example, ten companies produce 90 percent of the oil 
output, and a single company, Gazprom, controls 80 percent of the country’s natural gas. 170 
 The result of the United States’ unique energy market is that U.S. drilling 
capacity and intensity dwarf that of other countries. Since the dawn of the 
oil and gas age in the nineteenth century, nearly 4 million wells have been 
drilled in the United States versus only 1.5 million in the rest of the world 
combined. 171 At present, the United States owns 60 percent of all the rigs in 
the world, and 95 percent of American rigs can perform horizontal drilling, 
unlike those of other countries. 172 Since 2010, 99 percent of the horizontal 
wells drilled globally have been drilled in the United States. 173
 In sum, for geologic, technological, and institutional reasons, the 
United States will reap disproportionate benefi ts from its energy 
resources for the foreseeable future. 174 Already, shale production has 
slashed oil and gas prices in the United States, created more than one 
million new jobs, and added $400 billion—roughly 2.5 percent of GDP or 
$1,400 for every American—to the U.S. economy every year since 2010. 175
CHAPTER 5
122
 Energy independence might also help the United States accumulate 
wealth and power in indirect ways. 176 For example, some analysts expect the 
United States to shift to a cheaper “over-the-horizon” military posture in the 
Persian Gulf. 177 The U.S. decision not to get too deeply involved in the Libyan and Syrian civil wars might be the new normal. China, by contrast, is 
headed in the opposite direction. By 2035, it will be the world’s largest petroleum consumer and will import 85 percent of its oil from the Middle East. 178
Chinese strategists fear that China will have to take over the burden of stabilizing the Middle East as the United States becomes less involved there. 179 
 American energy exports also might reduce China and Russia’s ability to 
coerce U.S. allies in Asia and Europe. Currently, many U.S. allies in Europe 
depend on natural gas from Russia; and U.S. allies in Asia depend on oil 
and gas shipped through the South China Sea, where China’s navy lurks. 180
American energy exports, however, could “unshackle” U.S. allies from reliance on Russian gas and reduce China’s ability to blockade allies in East 
Asia by opening up secure energy supply routes across the Pacifi c. 181
 Transport Infrastructure. America is primed for cheap internal transportation. 182 The continental United States has 14,650 miles of navigable 
rivers (rivers that can handle drafts of nine feet for at least nine months 
of the year), which is more than the rest of the world combined. 183 The 
United States also has a “bonus” three-thousand-mile waterway along 
its eastern coast, where thousands of barrier islands turn exposed coastline into a series of connected bays stretching from the Chesapeake to 
the Texas-Mexican border. Consequently, 90 percent of the population 
of the continental United States lives within 150 miles of a navigable 
waterway. 184 
 This unique waterway network saves the United States hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure costs each year and stitches together a giant 
national market. 185 Americans living almost anywhere in the lower fortyeight states can enjoy goods produced in other regions without paying 
exorbitant shipping costs. For this reason, the U.S. consumer market has 
been the largest in the world since the Civil War and is equal to the consumer markets of the next fi ve nations—China, Japan, Germany, Britain, 
and France—combined. 186
 In addition, the United States has more natural deepwater ports than the 
rest of the world combined. 187 Puget Sound, San Francisco Bay, and Chesapeake Bay are the world’s three largest and best natural harbors. Chesapeake Bay alone has more deepwater port area than the entire coastline 
of Asia, from northeastern Russia to the southern tip of India. New York 
Harbor, Mobile Bay, and the thirteen deepwater ports in Texas are “merely 
world class.” 188
 These ports enable the United States to exploit its unique location 
between the world’s two great trading zones in Europe and Asia; when one 
FUTURE PROSPECTS
123
of those regions is in recession, the United States can shift trade and investment fl ows to the other. 189 The advantage of this swing capacity is illustrated by a simple fact: in the post–World War II era, no recession in Europe 
or Asia has caused a recession in the United States, but every American 
recession has triggered recessions in Europe and Asia. 190
 Buffers. The United States is the only great power that does not share a 
land or sea border with another great power. Its two land neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are weak and separated from the United States by rugged 
borders. Neither poses a conventional military threat to the U.S. homeland, 
nor do any of the great powers of Eurasia. As discussed earlier, China, the 
most militarily powerful of the second-rank powers, cannot maintain sea or 
air control in its near seas; doing so in the Pacifi c Ocean or near the American coast is out of the question. 
 Whereas the United States is bordered by allies and oceans, the other 
great powers are packed together in Eurasia and encircled by rivals. Figure 5.4 compares the U.S. security environment with that of the other great 
powers by charting the combined defense spending of each country’s 
neighbors. The United States is clearly in the safest location. 
 Whereas the United States is immune to a Eurasian invasion, the U.S. 
military has numerous launching pads from which to impose itself on 
Eurasia. The United States has 587 military bases scattered across every 
continent except Antarctica and on islands in every ocean. 191 This global 
military presence not only enhances U.S. power, but also underscores the 
fact that forty-two countries, including most of the great powers, have 
 Figure 5.4 . Combined defense spending of each great power’s neighbors (constant 2015 $) .

 institutions 
 The most widely used measures of government capacity and accountability are the World Bank’s six Worldwide Governance Indicators, which 
aggregate data from more than thirty international institutions, media outlets, think tanks, survey institutes, and private fi rms. 192 Three of these 
indicators measure aspects of state capacity: government effectiveness, 
regulatory quality, and political stability and the absence of violence. The 
other three indicators measure accountability: voice and accountability, 
rule of law, and control of corruption. Below, I use these indicators to provide a fi rst look at each great power’s institutions. Then I supplement the 
indicators with data from country-specifi c studies. The results suggest that 
the United States has much more capable and accountable institutions than 
Russia, China, or India; slightly more capable and accountable institutions 
than France; and slightly less capable and accountable institutions than 
Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. 
 Capacity. The United States scores slightly lower in terms of state capacity 
than Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom ( fi gure 5.5 ) mainly because it 
has a smaller and more divided state. The U.S. system has more “veto points” 
(aka checks and balances spread across the courts, Congress, presidency, and 
the states) than the parliamentary systems common in other developed 
democracies; 193 and as a percentage of GDP, the United States has the third

lowest levels of government spending and tax revenues among the thirtyfour countries in the OECD. American fi scal capacity is only 80 percent that 
of Japan, 75 percent that of the United Kingdom, 67 percent that of Germany, 
and half that of Denmark, which tops the World Bank’s state capacity 
rankings. 194 
 History helps explain why the U.S. government is smaller and more 
divided than that of other developed countries. In Western Europe and Japan, 
law and a modern state came fi rst, followed later by democracy. 195 The United 
States, by contrast, was born a democracy and only began developing a modern bureaucracy in the 1880s. 196 For most of U.S. history, a vast western frontier, the relative absence of foreign threats, and a liberal ideology limited state 
building. The U.S. government expanded during the World Wars and the 
Cold War, but less so than the governments of other major powers. 197 The 
American constitutional system, designed to minimize government and 
maximize liberty, facilitates commerce but constrains state capacity. 
 The downside is that the U.S. government provides fewer services to its 
citizens. Consequently, the percentage of Americans living in poverty is 60 
to 100 percent greater than that in Western Europe and Japan. 198 Although 
Social Security and Medicare help the elderly, working-age Americans basically have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps: as a share of GDP, the 
United States spends six times less than the OECD average on so-called 
active labor-market policies, such as job training programs, job-search 
assistance, and hiring subsidies; and three times less on family benefi ts, 
such as childcare support and early education programs. 199 As of 2018, 
some Republican lawmakers are clamoring to cut these benefi ts further to 
help pay for the 2017 tax cuts, which reduced U.S. government revenues by 
$1.5 trillion. 200
 The payoff of the weak U.S. state is that it facilitates entrepreneurship 
and private investment. 201 In the United States, it takes half as many steps, 
and less than half the time, to start a business, obtain construction permits, 
register property, and enforce contracts as it does in Europe and Japan. 202
As a result, Americans are 50 to 300 percent more likely than Europeans 
and Japanese to start new businesses; 203 and U.S. venture capital investment as a share of GDP is seven and a half to twelve times greater than that 
of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan. 204 Americans hire and 
fi re each other more frequently than do Europeans and Japanese, work 5 to 
30 percent longer, produce 10 to 50 percent more output per hour, and earn 
50 to 65 percent higher wages. 205
 Limited government may have served the United States well for most of 
its history, but past performance is no guarantee of future success. The 
United States has the dubious distinction of being the only presidential 
democracy (i.e., a system with separate executive and legislative branches) 
with a long history of political stability. 206 Others, most of which are in Latin 
America, have tended to oscillate between authoritarianism and chaos. The 
CHAPTER 5
126
reason is that presidential systems have an Achilles heel: they require contending branches of government to compromise and strike bargains. In 
parliamentary systems, by contrast, the prime minister usually heads a 
majority in the legislature, and political stalemates can be overcome on the 
spot by holding new elections. Without such safety valves, the American 
system is susceptible to political polarization, legislative gridlock, and capture by special interests. As I discuss in the next chapter, such problems are 
already infecting the American government and threaten to undermine 
U.S. state capacity in the decades ahead. 
 For the time being, however, U.S. state capacity is only slightly below 
that of Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, and far above that of 
Russia, China, and India. 
 Russia’s personalist regime gives the president, Vladimir Putin, immense 
power over the secret police, the media, and fl ows of cash, but not for providing services to citizens or enforcing laws across Russia’s sprawling territory. 207 During his fi rst two terms, more than 1,800 of Putin’s decrees 
were ignored or circumvented, 208 and Putin himself estimates that only 
about 20 percent of his decisions get implemented unless he intervenes 
forcefully. 209 The former president, Dmitri Medvedev, has stated: “Without 
exaggeration, Russia is a country of legal nihilism. . . . No other European 
country can boast of such a level of disregard for law.” 210 Rigorous studies 
corroborate this claim: nearly 30 percent of Russians admit to breaking the 
law on a regular basis, and Russian police earn more money from second 
jobs (roughly 40 percent of which involves illegal activity) than from their 
offi cial salaries. 211 
 China also has severe state capacity problems. While formal authority is 
concentrated in Beijing, much policy implementation is delegated to local 
governments that routinely evade central government mandates. 212 Local 
autonomy may have spurred growth during the reform years by allowing 
different regions to experiment with different policies (although this claim 
is debated among China scholars), 213 but now China’s “decentralized 
authoritarianism” is undermining Beijing’s efforts to “rebalance” the 
economy from investment to domestic consumption and innovation. 214 In 
November 2013, the Communist Party outlined sixty reform proposals 
affecting almost every aspect of the economy, but less than 10 percent were 
implemented. 215
 Many Chinese local government offi cials and bosses of state-owned fi rms 
siphon state funds on the sly. In a typical arrangement, a local government 
will seize land from peasants and transfer ownership to a shell company, 
which uses the land as collateral to borrow from state banks and shadow 
lenders. 216 Local rulers then use these funds to line their pockets, run 
patronage networks, and build extravagant infrastructure projects, reasonably assuming that Beijing will never dare call in its loans, which now total 
more than 40 percent of China’s GDP. 217 In essence, local governments have 
FUTURE PROSPECTS
127
become too big to fail, so the central government is unable to impose fi scal 
discipline. 218 The results for the country will be devastating over the longterm. As shown in chapter 3 , China has racked up more debt and excess 
capacity than any developing country in history. 219
 India, too, lacks state capacity. Only 3 percent of India’s population 
pays taxes (most people are too poor), so India’s tax base is comparable to 
that of a small European country. India’s government revenues are equal 
only to 20 percent of its GDP, whereas tax revenues in the other great 
powers are equal to 30 to 50 percent of GDP, 220 and India’s urban per capita public spending is only $50, which is only 14 percent of China’s $362 
and 3 percent of the United Kingdom’s $1,772. 221 These fi gures actually 
overstate India’s fi scal capacity, because half of India’s public spending is 
wasted or stolen. 222 For example, at least 30 percent of India’s agricultural 
produce rots on the shelf, because the country lacks a basic food supply 
network. 223 
 The result of India’s state weakness is endemic poverty. More than 
half of India’s population (roughly 680 million people) lacks consistent 
access to food, clean water, electricity, housing, toilets, healthcare, education, or paved roads. 224 The Indian government has drafted a series of 
pro-growth initiatives, but has failed to implement most of them, which 
may actually be a good thing given the government’s long record of economic incompetence—a common saying is that “India’s economy only 
grows at night while the government is asleep.” The World Bank ranks 
India 130th out of 190 countries in terms of the ease of doing business, 
178th for enforcing contracts, and 183rd for securing construction permits. On average, it takes the Indian government 3.8 years to settle a 
court case (versus one year in OECD countries) and 4.3 years to resolve 
a bankruptcy case, with an average recovery rate of only 26 cents on the 
dollar. 225 By contrast, bankruptcy cases in OECD countries are resolved 
in 1.7 years, on average, and recover 71 cents on the dollar. 226 
 Accountability. Despite having a more open system, the United States 
ranks slightly lower than rich European nations and Japan in terms of 
government accountability ( fi gure 5.6 ). Ironically, out of fear of empowering “big government,” Americans have created a system that entrusts 
unelected courts, congressional committees, and interest groups to carry 
out government functions that in Western Europe and Japan are performed by professional bureaucracies. 227 
 The power of courts and interest groups yields excessive litigation and 
gargantuan pieces of legislation fi lled with thousands of giveaways to special interests. For example, the 2010 Dodd-Frank bill, which regulates the 
fi nancial industry, is 849 pages long, not counting several thousand pages 
of additional rules. The Affordable Care Act is 2,700 pages plus 20,000 
additional pages of regulations. 228 The 2017 tax cut bill is nearly 500 pages 
CHAPTER 5
128
long, received input from more than half of the 11,000 lobbyists living in 
Washington, D.C., and created a tax code that is nearly 4 million words 
long—roughly ten times as long as the tax codes of Germany and France. 229
These laws, and many others, are so long because they are dotted with 
loopholes, many of which have been put in place by the very industries 
they are supposed to regulate—a process that academics call “regulatory 
capture.” 230
 Special interests are not necessarily bad. Alexis de Tocqueville famously 
praised American interest groups as “schools” for democracy, because they 
bring people together to solve common problems and resist tyranny. 231
According to “pluralist” theory, a cacophony of interest groups produces 
sound public policy, just as competition among self-interested fi rms in a 
free market boosts the aggregate wealth of society. 232
 Yet the actual practice of democracy in America bears little resemblance 
to this pluralist utopia. The interest groups that command the attention of 
Congress represent the most politically organized and engaged segments of 
American society, which in many cases means the wealthiest. 233 For this 
reason, some pundits now consider the United States a “kleptocracy.” 234
That conclusion may be hyperbolic, but it captures more than a grain of 
truth and refl ects the feelings of many Americans that the system is rigged 
by elites. 235
 No doubt, American democracy has serious problems. When analyzing 
the global balance of power, however, it is important to keep America’s 
shortcomings in international perspective. The U.S. system is only slightly 
less accountable than that of Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom;

and it is much more accountable than the governments of Russia, China, 
and India. 
 Russia has oscillated among shades of authoritarianism for the past century. 236 At present, the country is dominated by a single ruler, Vladimir 
Putin, who runs a “pyramid of patronage” over a small band of tycoons 
that collectively own the commanding heights of the economy. 237 Private 
property rights are nonexistent. According to The Economist , Russians are 
not so much property owners as “temporary holders,” serving at the pleasure of “Tsar” Putin, his oligarch cronies, and his henchmen at the Federal 
Security Service (the successor to the KGB). 238 Under Putin, the state-owned 
share of the economy doubled from 35 percent in 2005 to 70 percent in 
2015. 239 Putin himself seems to be the main benefi ciary of this state expansion, having amassed a personal fortune estimated between $40 billion and 
$200 billion: the low estimate would make Putin the richest man in Europe; 
the high estimate would make Putin almost twice as wealthy as Jeff Bezos, 
the richest man in the world. 240
 China’s government is becoming just as personalist and patrimonial as 
Russia’s. Chinese president Xi Jinping has appointed himself “chairman of 
everything” and, by all accounts, rules as an “imperial president.” 241 At the 
2017 party congress, Xi amended the party constitution with a new guiding 
ideology, Xi Jinping Thought, and packed the highest levels of government 
with loyal followers: fi fteen of the twenty-fi ve members of the Politburo have 
long-term ties to Xi; and none of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest body in the Chinese government, is qualifi ed by 
rank and age to succeed Xi. 242 In 2018, China’s legislature abolished presidential term limits, paving the way for Xi to rule China until the day he dies.
 Xi presides over the Chinese Communist Party, an oligarchy that owns 
almost all of China’s land and roughly two-thirds of its assets. 243 The constitution states explicitly that the Chinese government can confi scate private 
property at any time; every company with more than fi fty employees is 
required to have a Communist Party offi cial on staff; and 70 percent of private companies in China (domestic and foreign) now have a party cell on 
site that monitors workers and operations. 244
 In addition, the Chinese government is carrying out “the most extensive 
effort to selectively censor human expression ever implemented.” 245 It controls the media, employs hundreds of thousands of internet police to 
remove online content that might spur social mobilization; employs 2 million netizens to fl ood social media with fake posts celebrating the Communist Party and trolling its critics; and systematically deletes historical 
documents that challenge party orthodoxy. 246 In 2017, China ranked 186th 
out of 197 countries on a scale of press freedom. 247
 Most disturbing, the Chinese regime is developing a “social credit score” 
system that will determine each citizen’s access to essential services—
including education, bank loans, insurance, and transportation—and help 
CHAPTER 5
130
the regime monitor and detain dissidents. 248 To build this system, the Chinese government is collecting blood and saliva samples and cell phone data 
from Chinese citizens and developing facial recognition technology that 
can identify any of China’s 1.4 billion people within three seconds. 249 Chinese cities are already experimenting with the system. In Shenzhen, the 
local government deters jaywalkers by posting their names and pictures on 
a screen as they approach an intersection. 250 In Beijing, the government 
does the same in public restrooms to stop people from stealing toilet paper 
(the offi cial limit is sixty centimeters per nine-minute period). 251 China 
already imprisons thousands of dissidents without trial. 252 Once the social 
credit system goes live nationwide in 2020, the ranks of Chinese political 
prisoners will probably swell. 
 In the meantime, the Chinese government has preemptively barred Chinese citizens from taking money out of the country, so most people have 
little choice but to place their life-savings in state-owned banks, where 
interest rates are set below the rate of infl ation. This “fi nancial repression” 
enables the party to run a massive patronage network and security apparatus, which in turn enables the party to function as “the dominant dispenser of commercial, business, professional, and even social opportunity” 
throughout the country. 253 
 Crucially, the Communist Party holds the senior management positions 
of all of the major state-owned enterprises, which receive 75 percent of the 
country’s bank loans and 95 percent of government stimulus spending. 254
Private fi rms, by contrast, are forced to take out high-interest loans from 
shadow banks and bribe party members for permits and protection from 
expropriation. 255 This “crony capitalist” system has been highly lucrative 
for China’s ruling elite. 256 Among the 1,271 richest people in China, 203 are 
delegates to the National People’s Congress, the nation’s legislature. 257 In 
2015, the delegates’ combined net worth was $463.8 billion, which was 
more than the GDP of Austria that year. 258 Meanwhile, 40 percent of China’s population still lives on less than $5.50 per day. 259
 India holds regular elections, but state-ownership and corruption limit 
government accountability. The state owns 70 percent of the banking system as well as major insurance companies, utilities, hotels, and an airline. 
India ranks seventy-sixth out of 168 countries in corruption perceptions, 
and India’s political system is populated by “authoritarian” leaders—
roughly 20 percent of whom have been charged with violent crimes—that 
use “money and muscle” to carve out fi efdoms for themselves and “run 
industries rather than regulate them.” 260 In public surveys, more than half 
of Indian respondents report regularly paying bribes for basic public services, including police protection, utilities, education, and medical attention; and more than 80 percent of Indians say the government and political 
parties are infected with corruption. 261 Sadly, Salman Rushdie’s aphorism 
remains as apt as ever: “Indian democracy: one man, one bribe.” 262
FUTURE PROSPECTS
131
 demography 
 Population Size. The United States is the only major power with a 
working-age population (people of ages fi fteen to sixty-four) that is projected to grow throughout the century. 263 Whereas the United States will 
add 40 million working-age adults, China will lose 470 million—half of 
its current workforce. Labor forces in Western Europe will shrivel due to 
low birth rates. And Japan’s population is already dying off rapidly, as 
evidenced by the fact that the country consumes more diapers for seniors 
than for babies. 264 
 Russia’s labor force will “implode,” shrinking 30 percent by midcentury, because of high death rates. 265 From 1991 to 2009, Russia was a 
“mortality society” with three funerals for every two live births—the 
worst surfeit of peacetime deaths over births in modern history besides 
China’s ratios during the Great Leap Forward, when 30 million people 
starved to death. Russia’s high mortality rate is mainly due to rampant 
binge drinking and related traffi c accidents, murders, and suicides. 266
The Russian government launched public health initiatives in 2006 to 
reduce these harms, but then reversed course and slashed public health 
budgets to save money during the 2008 fi nancial crisis. At present, Russian death rates remain the tenth highest in the world and are on par 
with Somalia’s. 267 
 India’s labor force will peak in 2035 and then decline steadily. 
Although India’s working-age population will remain much larger than 
the United States’, only 55 percent of India’s working-age population 
has a job versus 73 percent of Americans of working age. India’s labor 
force participation rate is low partly because of chronic poverty and 
partly because of systematic discrimination against women—only 28 per -
cent of Indian working-age women are employed outside the home, a 
ratio that is one of the lowest in the world (only Pakistan and a few 
countries in the Middle East have lower shares). 268 Perhaps India’s 
cultural norms will change in the decades ahead. At present, however, 
the trends are moving in the opposite direction: from 2005 to 2014, the 
share of Indian women in the workforce declined from 38 percent to 
28 percent. 269 
 Population Age. By 2040, the United States will have the second youngest 
population among the great powers ( fi gure 5.7 ). More important, the U.S. 
median age will remain stable for the rest of the century whereas that of the 
other great powers will rise. 
 China’s median age will surge from 35 to 50 between 2015 and 2050, and 
the number of Chinese older than 65 is expected to rise from roughly 130 
million to 410 million—a population of geriatrics larger than the total U.S. 
population and nearly equivalent to the combined populations of Germany, 
CHAPTER 5
132
Japan, France, Britain, and Russia. China currently has eight workers for 
every retiree; by 2050, it will have two workers per retiree. 
 In 2015, China relaxed its one-child policy, allowing some parents to have 
two children. Despite this reform, however, China is guaranteed to suffer 
the most rapid aging process in human history, because China’s huge population of future senior citizens and the tiny one-child generation that must 
support it have already been born. Moreover, many Chinese families now 
opt to have only one child, mostly for fi nancial reasons, and 40 million Chinese men will not be able to start a family at all because a cultural preference for sons spurred widespread abortion of female fetuses over the past 
three decades. 270
 Education. The United States leads the other great powers in quantity of 
education, but lags behind some of them in quality. Americans receive, on 
average, one to three more years of schooling than people in Germany, the 
United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, and France; and roughly twice as many 
years of schooling as people in China and India. 271 On international tests, 
however, American teenagers score similarly to their peers in the other 
great powers in reading and science and score signifi cantly worse in 
math. 272
 The most famous of these exams is the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test. Every three years, half a million 
fi fteen-year-olds in sixty-nine countries take the two-hour test, which asks 
them to solve problems, identify patterns, and write essays. American

students have always scored in the middle of the pack among developed 
countries on these exams since they were instituted in 2000. 
 Scholars have criticized the PISA tests, because different countries draw 
test-takers from different socioeconomic backgrounds. China’s results, for 
example, are based solely on scores from four of China’s wealthiest locales 
(Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Guangdong) and do not include the scores 
of the millions of migrant children living in these areas. If similar adjustments are made to U.S. scores (for example, by only using scores from students in Massachusetts), then the United States would rank fi rst in the 
world in reading, second in science (after Singapore), and twelfth in math 
(ahead of all the major powers except Japan and Germany). 273
 Another factor may be that American students simply do not try very 
hard on international tests that have little to no effect on their social or educational standing at home—a situation that is not the case for students in 
some other countries. A 2017 study by American and Chinese economists 
found that introducing fi nancial incentives for good performance, by allowing students to keep $1 for every correct answer, dramatically improved the 
performance of American students but not of Chinese students. 274
 Nevertheless, the PISA test remains the best cross-national metric of educational quality and reveals genuine fl aws in the U.S. education system. 275
Most notable, the cross-national data suggest that the American system of 
teacher recruitment, training, and accountability has been put together 
backward: it draws teachers from the bottom half of college classes; gives 
them minimal training; and when teachers fail to improve student performance, the government imposes rigid standards, hoping to do on the back 
end what it failed to create on the front end. 276 By contrast, countries with 
top PISA scores, such as Japan, Singapore, and Finland, do the opposite: 
they select teachers from the top third of college classes, train them rigorously, and then give them the freedom and time to hone their skills and 
share best practices with other teachers. 277 As Harvard’s Jal Mehta has 
shown, such methods largely obviate the need for external accountability, 
because “selection and preparation on the front end makes extensive monitoring on the back end unnecessary.” 278
 Despite these shortcomings, however, the United States ranks fi rst among 
the great powers by standard measures of human capital per capita and 
labor productivity. 279 These results are puzzling: how can the United States 
have the most productive workforce in the world when it has a mediocre 
primary and secondary education system? 
 Studies on this question have produced three main answers. 280 One is 
simply that the United States enjoys other economic advantages—most 
notably its excellent geography and business-friendly commitment to limited government—that compensate for its educational shortcomings. A second reason is that the United States makes up for a lack of educational 
quality with greater quantity: American teenagers may lag several years 
CHAPTER 5
134
behind their foreign peers in cognitive skills, but they will receive several 
more years of education, on average, during their lifetimes. Third, the 
United States poaches human capital from other countries. As the home of 
50 of the top 100 universities in the world, the United States is able to attract 
millions of smart, young people from other countries every year, including 
hundreds of thousands of doctoral candidates in science and engineering 
fi elds. 281 More than half of these students join the American workforce and 
stay for at least fi ve years after they graduate, bolstering the U.S. stock of 
human capital while draining the stocks of other nations. 282
 The United States is far from perfect, but it has better growth prospects 
than the other great powers—as well as a huge economic and military lead. 
Unipolarity is not guaranteed to endure, but present trends strongly suggest that it will persist for many decades. The fi nal chapter discusses what 
this development means for world politics and U.S. policy. 
135
 chapter 6 
 The Unipolar Era 
 “If Sparta and Rome perished,” the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau 
asked, “what State can hope to endure forever?” 1
 The resounding answer 
given by history is “no state.” In time, perhaps in another century or so, the 
American empire will crumble and new powers will rise. But we are not 
there yet, nor will we be for many decades. We are living in the unipolar 
era, and it will probably outlive us. 
 So what? The United States might be the most powerful country in history, but it has a limited presence in many corners of the globe, and weaker 
nations routinely trample on U.S. interests. 2
 The United States failed to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the rise of the Islamic State, the Russian invasion of Crimea, Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, 
North Korean nuclear proliferation, and Chinese island-building in the 
South China Sea. Unipolarity, bipolarity, multipolarity: What difference 
does it make? 
 In this fi nal chapter, I explain why this view is wrong by highlighting 
several ways that unipolarity transforms world politics. The good news is 
that unipolarity dramatically reduces the likelihood of great power war. 
The bad news is that it may increase the likelihood of asymmetric confl ict 
and undermine American national unity and the liberal world order. 
 No Hegemonic Rivalry 
 The story of world politics is often told as a game of thrones in which a 
rotating cast of great powers battles for top-dog status. According to 
researchers led by Graham Allison at Harvard, there have been sixteen 
cases in the past fi ve hundred years when a rising power challenged a ruling power. 3
 Twelve of these cases ended in carnage. One can quibble with 
Allison’s case selection, but the basic pattern is clear: hegemonic rivalry has 
sparked a catastrophic war every forty years on average for the past half 
millennium. 
CHAPTER 6
136
 The emergence of unipolarity in 1991 has put this cycle of hegemonic 
competition on hold. Obviously wars and security competition still occur 
in today’s unipolar world—in fact, as I explain later, unipolarity has made 
certain types of asymmetric confl ict more likely—but none of these confl icts have the global scope or generational length of a hegemonic rivalry. 
 To appreciate this point, just consider the Cold War—one of the four 
“peaceful” cases of hegemonic rivalry identifi ed by Allison’s study. 
Although the two superpowers never went to war, they divided the world 
into rival camps, waged proxy wars that killed millions of people, and 
pushed each other to the brink of nuclear Armageddon. For forty-fi ve 
years, World War III and human extinction were nontrivial possibilities. 
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, by contrast, the United States has 
not faced a hegemonic rival, and the world, though far from perfect, has 
been more peaceful and prosperous than ever before. 
 Just look at the numbers. From 1400 to 1991, the rate of war deaths worldwide hovered between 5 and 10 deaths per 100,000 people and spiked to 
200 deaths per 100,000 during major wars. 4
 After 1991, however, war death 
rates dropped to 0.5 deaths per 100,000 people and have stayed there ever 
since. Interstate wars have disappeared almost entirely, and the number of 
civil wars has declined by more than 30 percent. 5
 Meanwhile, the global 
economy has quadrupled in size, creating more wealth between 1991 and 
2018 than in all prior human history combined. 6
 What explains this unprecedented outbreak of peace and prosperity? 
Some scholars attribute it to advances in communications technology, from 
the printing press to the telegraph to the Internet, which supposedly spread 
empathy around the globe and caused entire nations to place a higher value 
on human life. 7
 Such explanations are appealing, because they play on our natural desire 
to believe in human progress, but are they convincing? Did humans suddenly become 10 to 20 times less violent and cruel in 1991? Are we orders 
of magnitude more noble and kind than our grandparents? Has social 
media made us more empathetic? Of course not, which is why the dramatic decline in warfare after 1991 is better explained by geopolitics than 
sociology. 8
 
 The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War and related 
proxy fi ghting, it also opened up large swathes of the world to democracy, 
international commerce, and peacekeeping forces—all of which surged 
after 1991 and further dampened confl ict. 9
 Faced with overwhelming U.S. 
economic and military might, most countries have decided to work within 
the American-led liberal order rather than fi ght to overturn it. 10 As of 2018, 
nearly seventy countries have joined the U.S. alliance network—a Kantian 
community in which war is unthinkable—and even the two main challengers to this community, China and Russia, begrudgingly participate in the 
institutions of the liberal order (e.g., the UN, the WTO, the IMF, World 
THE UNIPOLAR ERA
137
Bank, and the G-20), engage in commerce with the United States and its 
allies, and contribute to international peacekeeping missions. 11 History 
may not have ended in 1991, but it clearly changed in profound ways—and 
mostly for the better. 
 Crisis Instability 
 Unfortunately, the unipolar era will not be totally free from confl ict. 
Although unipolarity precludes hegemonic rivalry, it may increase the risk 
that crises between the United States and weaker nations will escalate to 
war. 12 The reason is that U.S. military superiority could embolden the 
United States to stand fi rm in a crisis while simultaneously inciting weaker 
opponents to shoot fi rst, in a desperate attempt to stun the United States 
before the U.S. military wipes out their offensive forces. 13
 Under unipolarity, this dynamic looms over U.S. relations with all 
nations. It is most dangerous, however, with regard to North Korea, 
China, and Russia, because these countries can infl ict apocalyptic damage 
on American cities and have ongoing disputes with the United States over 
territory (e.g., Taiwan, Crimea, the Korean Peninsula), the U.S. military 
presence abroad, freedom of navigation, and human rights. In the years 
ahead, many events can, and almost surely will, spark crises between the 
United States and these countries. A primary goal of U.S. security policy, 
therefore, must be to reduce the risk that such crises escalate to major 
wars. How? 
 north korea 
 The North Korean case is the gravest, but also the simplest, because the 
United States has no good options and only one nonhorrible option: deterrence. 14 North Korea will never give up its nuclear arsenal, which is its 
main insurance policy against a U.S. or South Korean attack, and the U.S. 
military cannot reliably destroy North Korea’s nuclear weapons or conventional artillery before it has a chance to use them. 15
 Deterrence may feel unsatisfying, because it places U.S. security at least 
partly in North Korea’s hands. Like old age, however, deterrence only 
seems intolerable until one considers the alternative. 16 The U.S. Department of Defense estimates that a U.S.-North Korean war would kill 20,000 
people per day in South Korea alone, even if no nuclear weapons were 
used. It also admits that the U.S. national missile defense system only has a 
50 percent chance of intercepting a North Korean ballistic missile headed 
for the U.S. mainland. 17 Given these dire statistics, the United States should 
learn to live with a North Korean nuclear capability—just as it learned to 
live with the Soviet and Chinese nuclear arsenals. 
CHAPTER 6
138
 Deterrence, however, does not mean doing nothing. The United States 
should continue to make clear that it will “totally destroy” North Korea if it 
attacks the United States or its allies or transfers nuclear materials to other 
states or groups. 18 To back up these threats, the United States should integrate additional terminal and midcourse interceptors to its national missile 
defense system and develop boost-phase interceptors. 19 It also should 
redouble efforts to improve civil defenses and counterforce capabilities. 20
These measures will enhance America’s ability to emerge from a nuclear 
war relatively unscathed, and thereby hopefully deter North Korea from 
starting a war in the fi rst place. 21
 At the same time, the United States should engage in diplomacy with 
North Korea and contingency planning with China. North Korea will never 
negotiate away its nuclear arsenal, but it might accept limits on that arsenal 
in exchange for U.S. security assurances. The United States therefore should 
offer to recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, forswear military strikes, and lift economic sanctions so long as North Korea abides by 
“three no’s”: no additional nuclear weapons, no improved nuclear weapons or delivery vehicles, and no export of nuclear materials. 22
 To compel North Korea to accept this bargain, the United States needs to 
tighten sanctions on North Korea, which in turn requires making a side 
deal with China. Currently the Chinese government looks the other way 
when Chinese companies smuggle goods into North Korea. China could 
crack down on these violations, but will do so only if it feels assured that a 
North Korean collapse, which would be made more likely by tighter sanctions, would not result in U.S. forces swarming up the Korean Peninsula 
toward China’s border. Recent research suggests that China is willing to 
abandon North Korea, but not if it means American troops on the banks of 
the Yalu. 23
 The United States, therefore, should offer China a deal: in return for full 
Chinese sanctions on North Korea, the United States will let China dictate 
the terms of a joint contingency plan for a North Korean collapse. As part of 
this plan, the United States would promise to keep its troops south of the 
38th parallel and offer to withdraw its forces entirely from the Korean Peninsula once the dust has settled if China will accede to a U.S. alliance with a 
reunifi ed Korea. 
 The U.S. military will probably hate this proposal, because it cedes control of North Korea’s territory and nuclear sites to China without a fi ght. 
Allowing China to secure North Korea, however, would keep U.S. troops 
out of a potential nuclear hellhole and reduce the likelihood of a U.S.-China 
clash. 24 The geographic reality is that Chinese forces can occupy North 
Korea before U.S. reinforcements even mobilize for an attack—China has at 
least 150,000 troops perched on its border with North Korea, which is only 
sixty miles from North Korea’s main nuclear sites and two-thirds of its missile sites. 25 Given that Chinese troops will be fi rst on the scene, the U.S. 
THE UNIPOLAR ERA

military should stay out of their way. Instead of going to war with China 
over North Korea’s carcass, the United States should help China secure the 
area by providing intelligence on North Korea’s nuclear sites and technical 
expertise to dismantle them. 
 china and russia 
 The situations with China and Russia are less dire than the North Korean 
case, but more complicated, because China and Russia have more ways to 
hurt the United States but also more to offer it. Even as the United States 
competes with these powers for infl uence, it cooperates with them in 
numerous areas. Adopting a policy of pure deterrence, therefore, would be 
shortsighted and dangerous. 
 Unfortunately, there is widespread disagreement among strategists about 
what the United States should do to enhance crisis stability with these two 
regional powers, aside from some fairly obvious confi dence building measures, including codes of conduct for military forces and for civilian aircraft 
and ships, backchannels for diplomats to work out face-saving compromises, crisis hotlines linking the top leaderships, military-to-military 
exchanges, cyber and nuclear risk reduction centers, and joint peace and 
humanitarian operations. 26
 Some scholars argue that the United States should simply retrench from 
East Asia and Eastern Europe and grant China and Russia broad spheres of 
infl uence. 27 The most extreme of these proposals would have the United 
States abrogate its alliances in Asia and Europe and pull its forces out of 
both regions. 
 Retrenchment has its appeal. 28 Indeed, it seems the logical, God-given 
strategy for a self-suffi cient superpower protected by two vast oceans. Yet 
large-scale retrenchment not only would sap U.S. infl uence in Asia and 
Europe, but also reduce crisis stability by undermining deterrence. 29 China 
or Russia might be emboldened by a U.S. withdrawal from their regions 
and ramp up coercive pressure on their demoralized neighbors. Successful 
security policy requires a balance of reassurance and deterrence. 30 Retrenchment is skewed too heavily toward the former. 
 A better way to enhance crisis stability while preserving the territorial 
status quo in Asia and Europe would be to combine economic and political 
engagement with an “active denial” military strategy. 31 The overarching 
goal of this strategy would be to create local “situations of strength” that 
raise the costs of military aggression for China and Russia, but without 
backing them into a corner. 32 Such a strategy would have three main 
elements. 
 First, the United States would bolster the antiaccess/area-denial (A2/
AD) capabilities of China and Russia’s neighbors by providing them with 
loans, arms, training, and intelligence. The objective would be to turn China 
CHAPTER 6
140
and Russia’s neighbors into prickly “porcupines,” capable of denying territory to China and Russia but not to take and hold territory themselves. 33 In 
East Asia, this means helping China’s maritime neighbors acquire advanced 
anti-air and anti-ship missiles plus the platforms and targeting capabilities 
to launch them. In Eastern Europe, it means prepping the Baltic States to 
wage guerilla warfare. 34
 Second, the United States would create buffers between U.S. forces on the 
one hand and Chinese and Russian forces on the other. American forces 
would remain in Asia and Europe and roam wherever international law 
allows, but they would be stationed in dispersed and hardened bases scattered around the periphery of each region, where they could be called on in 
the event of war but otherwise kept beyond the reach of Chinese and Russian forces. Decreasing the number of American soldiers based near China 
and Russia’s borders would reduce the likelihood of incidents, help reassure China and Russia that the United States does not intend to launch 
massive strikes on their homelands at the outset of a crisis, and increase the 
resilience of U.S. forces in the region by reducing their exposure to Chinese 
or Russian preemptive attacks. 
 Third, the United States would backstop the local balances of power in 
Asia and Europe, but would plan to do so gradually. In minor confl icts, 
the United States would try to convince China or Russia to back down by 
using nonmilitary forms of coercion. 35 As described in chapter 5, the 
United States is uniquely empowered to impose painful sanctions and 
embargoes on hostile countries (and to deny enemies the ability to 
respond in kind) because of its central role in global banking, plentiful 
energy resources, and unparalleled ability to disrupt international shipping. 36 In the initial stages of a confl ict, therefore, the United States could 
use fi nancial sanctions, embargoes, or cyber operations to try to achieve 
“victory without violence,” as it did in compelling Iran to negotiate curbs 
on its nuclear program and in deterring Russia from annexing eastern 
Ukraine. 37 
 If the confl ict escalated to war, the United States could initially “lead 
from behind,” supporting local forces with logistics, intelligence, and if 
absolutely necessary, limited air and missile strikes on Chinese or Russian 
forces operating in the combat theater rather than those stationed on the 
Chinese or Russian mainlands. These strikes could be conducted from submarines, stealth-aircraft, or road-mobile missile batteries—all of which are 
far less vulnerable to Chinese and Russian A2/AD forces than surface 
ships, nonstealth aircraft, and ground forces. If the United States needed to 
ratchet up the pain, it could escalate horizontally before doing so vertically; 
that is, by opening up new geographic fronts rather than throwing U.S. 
forces into the cauldron of the main combat theater. 
 This strategy obviously sacrifi ces military effectiveness for crisis stability. 
The U.S. military could gain a major advantage over China or Russia if it 
THE UNIPOLAR ERA
141
simply unloaded on their bases, missile batteries, satellites, and radar 
installations at the outset of a war. The U.S. military generally favors this 
type of knockout punch strategy and for good reason: pinprick strikes and 
gradual escalation invite a grinding war of attrition. 38 Why give the enemy 
a chance to fi ght back? 
 Offensive doctrines make sense against weak states that do not have 
nuclear weapons. Against China or Russia, however, a military posture 
primed for rapid escalation could be a recipe for disaster. An offensive posture not only risks turning minor disputes into major wars, it also could 
turn conventional wars into nuclear wars. Some of the systems that support 
China and Russia’s conventional military forces—missile batteries, radars, 
satellites, submarines—also support their nuclear arsenals, so Chinese or 
Russian leaders might mistake U.S. strikes on these systems as a preemptive U.S. attack on their nuclear deterrents. Moreover, China and Russia 
have declared that they would use nuclear weapons to retaliate against a 
conventional attack on their homelands. Perhaps these declarations are 
bluffs. But is it really so hard to imagine that, in the heat of battle and when 
facing the potential annihilation of their militaries, one of these nations 
might fi re off a nuclear weapon in the hope of shocking the United States 
into a cease-fi re? Such a scenario might sound alarmist, but Russia’s military doctrine explicitly calls for using nuclear weapons to “deescalate” conventional wars, and Chinese leaders have suggested that the PLA is 
prepared to do likewise. 39
 In a multipolar or bipolar world, it might make sense for the United 
States to risk nuclear war to prevent a peer competitor from overrunning 
Asia or Europe. Better to nip the problem in the bud than repeat the mistakes of Munich and empower aggressors. In today’s unipolar world, however, no rival power is capable of going on a Hitler-style rampage across 
Eurasia, so the stakes for the United States in a war there would be moderate, and the main danger would be in doing too much rather than too little. 
Instead of rushing into wars with China or Russia, therefore, the United 
States should pick its battles, escalate gradually, and let local actors do most 
of the heavy lifting. 
 Imperial Overstretch 
 The theory of imperial overstretch holds that superpowers tend to expand 
beyond their means and collapse as a result. 40 Such overexpansion is 
driven in part by hubris. As Christopher Layne explains: “A hegemon easily is lured into overexpansion. When it comes to hard power, hegemons 
have it, and seldom can resist fl aunting it. . . . Thus, we should expect a 
unipolar hegemon to initiate many wars and to use its military power 
promiscuously.” 41 
CHAPTER 6
142
 In addition to hubris, superpowers also tend to suffer from a pervasive 
sense of insecurity. As Robert Jervis explains: 
 The very extent of the hegemon’s infl uence means that all sorts of geographic and ideological disturbances can threaten it. Frontiers can be 
expanded, but doing so just recreates them. . . . Hegemony thus also ironically magnifi es the sense of threat. The very fact that the United States has 
interests throughout the world leads to the fear that undesired changes in 
one area could undermine its interests elsewhere. . . . Disturbances that 
would be dismissed in a multipolar or bipolar world loom much larger for 
the hegemon because it is present in all corners of the globe and everything 
seems interconnected. 42
 In short, superpowers tend to become paranoid and militaristic, and these 
impulses, in turn, compel them to expand abroad—thereby creating more 
“turbulent frontiers” to defend, interests to pursue, and threats to address. 43
This self-perpetuating pattern of expansion ultimately exhausts the superpower’s resources because “the costs of empire tend to rise geometrically as 
its size increases, whereas its resources increase only arithmetically.” 44 
 Is the United States doomed to follow this historical pattern and fritter 
away its resources on reckless adventures abroad? In the wake of the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is hard to argue with the assessment that “the 
United States is becoming the poster child for strategic overextension.” 45
 Yet, U.S. overextension is not inevitable. In fact, a clear-eyed recognition 
of the unipolar distribution of power could help the United States temper 
its imperial temptations. 
 As the world’s only superpower, the United States is exceptionally secure 
and, therefore, can afford to play wait-and-see, allowing threats to emerge 
fully before responding. This situation stands in contrast to the Cold War, 
when anything that happened anywhere in the world seemingly had implications for the U.S.-Soviet power balance. Allies had to be wooed and coddled to keep them from joining the other side. Communist advances, even 
in peripheral areas, had to be countered to maintain U.S. prestige and credibility. Today, by contrast, there are no dominos that must be kept from falling, and America’s survival does not hang in the balance of the crisis of 
the day. The U.S. military, therefore, can focus on fi rst-order missions—
deterring major powers and rogue states that brandish weapons of mass 
destruction—rather than playing globo-cop. 
 The virtues of strategic restraint might seem obvious, but they often are 
lost in U.S. foreign policy debates. 46 As Fareed Zakaria points out, the American media and some policymaking elites in Washington remain wedded to 
a Cold War mindset that mistakes “activity for achievement.” 47 In this view, 
every crisis abroad and every move by a foreign rival must be countered 
with a robust assertion of American power. To do otherwise, some pundits 
THE UNIPOLAR ERA
143
and policymakers argue, would abdicate American leadership, embolden 
enemies, and demoralize allies. Better for the United States to shoot fi rst and 
develop a strategy later, they argue, then fail to intervene at all. 
 This misguided mindset has kept the U.S. military at war for most of the 
past two decades—with little to show for it. Of the campaigns in Kosovo, 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, only the fi rst could be considered a clear victory. 48 The combined costs of these confl icts—seven thousand American 
dead, fi fty thousand wounded, and $6 trillion—hardly seem justifi ed. 
To regain strategic solvency, the United States should take three steps. 
First, American policymakers should resurrect the so-called Powell Doctrine and make it the cornerstone of debate before every major military 
intervention. 49 This doctrine, which was originally developed by Secretary 
of Defense Caspar Weinberger in the 1980s and then elaborated by chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell in the 1990s, consisted of a 
series of questions that had to be answered “yes” before sending American 
soldiers to fi ght and die abroad: 
 1. Is a vital national security interest threatened? 
 2. Do we have a clear attainable objective? 
 3. Have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed? 
 4. Have all other nonviolent policy means been fully exhausted? 
 5. Is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement? 
 6. Have the consequences of our action been fully considered? 
 7. Is the action supported by the American people? 
 8. Do we have genuine broad international support? 
 The core assumption of the Powell Doctrine is that the United States 
rarely needs to rush into war to keep itself safe. It is a doctrine designed to 
conserve U.S. power, so that when vital interests are threatened, the U.S. 
military can respond vigorously with forces that have not been chewed up 
in wars of choice over trivial issues in peripheral areas. 
 In practice, the Powell Doctrine implies that the U.S. military should 
focus on preparing for wars against China and Russia, which are the only 
major powers not currently aligned with the United States, and against 
North Korea, which is the only minor power that currently has nuclear 
weapons and clear hostile intent toward the United States. The U.S. military also can allocate some resources to killing terrorists abroad, but this 
should be done primarily with special operations forces and drones rather 
than large-scale military occupations. 
 The doctrine further implies that the United States should avoid fi ghting 
wars where victory depends on controlling the politics of chaotic countries. 
As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown, local leaders will rarely 
do what the United States wants if doing so confl icts with their interests, 
and no reasonable amount of American blood or treasure can change that 
fundamental fact. 50 The United States can support local allies in troubled 
CHAPTER 6
144
regions with tools short of military occupation, including diplomacy, aid, 
military training, intelligence, arms, special operations raids, and drone 
strikes. In general, however, the U.S. military should be allowed to focus on 
its core competency—destroying enemy militaries—rather than being asked 
to rebuild tattered nations. 
 Second, Congress should reassert its authority to regulate the use of 
force. 51 According to the U.S. Constitution, Congress is supposed to decide 
where and when the United States goes to war. The president can order 
short-term military interventions, but only when the nation’s security is in 
imminent danger. The United States followed this Constitutional principle 
for most of its history. 
 Since the end of the Cold War, however, Congress has retreated from foreign policy. It allowed the Clinton administration to send U.S. forces to 
Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo without congressional authorization; rubberstamped the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq; and allowed the Obama 
administration to double U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2009 without a vote 
and attack Libya in 2011 without a single hearing. 
 In the future, Congress should subject proposals for large-scale military 
interventions to public debate and a formal vote. The foreign affairs committees could lead the way by holding hearings before each intervention 
and soliciting testimony from a wide-range of experts. These hearings 
could be paired with trips to the region in question, where members of 
Congress could meet with political actors and journalists, researchers, and 
aid workers. These practices were standard operating procedure in the 
1970s and 1980s and should become so again. 
 Congress also should pass legislation limiting the president’s ability to 
launch a preventive or unprovoked nuclear strike. 52 The president should 
still be able to order retaliatory or preemptive strikes, but preventive or 
unprovoked strikes should require sober deliberation among multiple offi -
cials. President Trump’s casual comments about nuclear war with North 
Korea underscore the risks of giving him unchecked authority to order an 
attack. To reduce these risks, Congress should require the unanimous consent of a small group of offi cials—including the vice president, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the four leaders 
of the House and the Senate—for any preventive or unprovoked nuclear 
strike. 
 Third, the United States should institute a war tax for any military operations that require supplemental funding. For nearly 200 years, from 1812 to 
2001, the United States paid for its wars in part by raising special taxes on 
individuals and corporations. These “pay as you fi ght” taxes ensured that 
all Americans sacrifi ced for the common cause. Since 9/11, however, the 
United States has paid for its wars by borrowing, adding trillions of dollars 
to the national debt. This practice of putting wars on the credit card is not 
just fi scally irresponsible, it is dangerous, because people are much more 
THE UNIPOLAR ERA
145
likely to support a stupid war if they do not have to pay higher taxes to 
fi nance it. 53 The fl ip side is that a mandatory war tax would make American 
leaders more judicious about when and where to send U.S. forces into 
battle. 54 
 The three steps highlighted above would almost certainly reduce U.S. 
military involvement in the Middle East. That would be wonderful. The 
United States has three important interests in the region—oil, counterterrorism, and democracy—but none requires a large U.S. military commitment. Instead, the United States should adopt an offshore balancing 
strategy in the Middle East, limiting its peacetime presence to a skeletal 
base structure, and put boots on the ground only if a local power threatens 
to dominate or destroy the region. 55
 The U.S. military does not need to guard Middle Eastern oil reserves, 
because no state is powerful enough to seize them or seriously disrupt 
world oil markets: Iraq’s military has already been neutered by the United 
States; Iran’s military has been ground down by decades of confl ict and 
sanctions; Iranian-backed Shiite militias lack the heavy forces and air 
defenses needed for large-scale conquest; and Saudi Arabia’s military is 
geared for internal security and air superiority, not ground invasions. 56 Iran 
could try to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, where most of the oil fl owing 
out of the Persian Gulf is shipped, but rigorous campaign analyses suggest 
that Iran could destroy only twenty oil tankers, a number far from suffi -
cient to shock the oil market, and the U.S. military could break an Iranian 
blockade with air and missile strikes launched from over the horizon. 57
 A Saudi civil war could threaten the free fl ow of oil, given that most of 
the Kingdom’s disgruntled Shia minority lives in the Eastern Province near 
the country’s oil production facilities. A mass uprising, however, is unlikely, 
because Saudi Arabia’s internal security forces are robust, roughly 90 percent of Saudi workers are government employees that depend on the monarchy for their livelihoods, and the Saudi government has huge cash 
reserves to keep the gravy train running during economic downturns. 58
Even if Saudi Arabia succumbs to civil war, sending U.S. Marines into 
Mecca and Medina would not pacify the situation. 59
 The United States also does not need a large military presence in the 
Middle East to contain Islamist terrorism. All of the deadly Islamist terrorist attacks committed on American soil since 9/11 have been carried out by 
U.S. citizens or legal residents, so bombing or occupying the Middle East 
for the umpteenth time is unlikely to reduce the risk of attacks further. 60
Moreover, that risk is already extremely low: since 1991, Americans have 
been four times more likely to drown in bathtubs than be killed by a 
jihadi. 61 The main battles in the war on terror should be fought by U.S. 
intelligence agencies and domestic law enforcement, not by the U.S. military. In this regard, the United States already does more than enough: it 
has more than a thousand government organizations and two thousand 
CHAPTER 6
146
private companies engaged in counterterrorism, giving it two counterterrorism organizations for every Islamist terrorist suspect it has ever arrested. 62
 Finally, the United States should not use military force to promote 
democracy in the Middle East. If two decades of nation-building in Iraq 
and Afghanistan have taught us anything, it is that the U.S. military cannot install liberal democracy where powerful local actors do not want it. 63
The United States succeeded in democratizing Germany and Japan after 
World War II only because their populations were war-weary and desperate for U.S. protection from the Soviet Union. 64 In the Middle East today, 
by contrast, most people hate the United States and do not share a common enemy with it. They therefore tend to view U.S. troops stomping 
around their homelands the same way the Vietnamese did in the 1960s. If 
the United States is serious about promoting democracy in the Middle 
East, it should reduce its support for corrupt authoritarian regimes there—
that is, by becoming less involved in the region—not by occupying more 
countries militarily. 
 Domestic Decay 
 According to a tradition of political thought going back to Plato and Aristotle, hegemons can become victims of their own success and collapse from 
within. 65 Having vanquished foreign rivals, various clans within the dominant nation may turn on each other, resulting in the weakening of national 
institutions and, in extreme cases, civil war. 
 This pattern—peace abroad fueling confl ict at home—has been documented by numerous scholars, including Max Weber, Otto Hintze, Charles 
Tilly, and Michael Desch. 66 These scholars have shown that during periods 
of great power competition nations tend to develop strong bureaucracies 
and effi cient systems of taxation and espouse a strong sense of patriotism 
and national unity. During periods of low external threat, however, nationstates sometimes tear apart. 67 For example, the relatively tranquil international environment in Europe from 1815 to 1853 (often called the Pax 
Britannica) witnessed an unprecedented breakdown in state cohesion and a 
series of revolutions in the late 1840s. 68 Similarly, the benign external threat 
environment enjoyed by the United States in the 1850s exacerbated internal 
tensions that culminated in the Civil War. 69 By contrast, during the World 
Wars and the fi rst half of the Cold War, American national unity rose and 
government institutions expanded dramatically in scope and size. 70
 Recent trends in the United States fi t this historical pattern: since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, partisan divisions in the United States 
have surged to levels not seen since the Civil War, and gridlock has become 
America’s political norm, with recent Congresses ranking among the most 
polarized and least productive in the post–World War II era ( fi gure 6.1 ). 71
THE UNIPOLAR ERA
147
The 9/11 terrorist attacks briefl y brought Americans together, but the camaraderie quickly evaporated, a fact that suggests that the threat of terrorism 
is not serious enough to mobilize the nation the way a genuine hegemonic 
rivalry does. If anything, the terrorist threat has probably exacerbated divisions within American society by inciting witch hunts for terrorist suspects 
and igniting vicious debates on immigration, torture, war, and privacy. 
 Without a unifying national mission, Americans have sorted themselves 
into clans based on social class and culture. Consequently, the two major 
political parties are divided not just by policy preferences, but also by identity. Rural whites now overwhelmingly vote Republican while most minorities and urban whites vote Democrat. 72 This crude tribalism leaves little 
room for compromise. If the partisan divide were merely about policy, the 
parties could split the difference. Now that American politics has become a 
clash of cultures, however, both parties view compromise with the other 
side as immoral and dangerous. 
 For this reason, policymaking in the unipolar era has lurched between gridlock and partisan overreach, and many of the problems highlighted in earlier 
chapters have festered, including spiraling entitlement costs; crumbling infrastructure; declining rates of upward mobility and entrepreneurship; racially

and economically stratifi ed systems of education and healthcare; a bloated and 
racially biased criminal justice system; a convoluted tax code that incentivizes 
tax evasion rather than domestic investment; and a crazy patchwork of federal, 
state, and local regulations that benefi t big fi rms with armies of lawyers rather 
than small start-ups or public infrastructure projects. 
 If present trends are not reversed, the United States may slip into a 
vicious cycle in which partisan gridlock undermines public trust in government, which incentivizes politicians to starve the government of resources 
and authority, which leads to even poorer government performance, which 
leads to more defunding of the bureaucracy. 
 This downward spiral has already begun. Non-defense discretionary 
spending, a category that includes everything besides interest payments on 
the national debt and spending on entitlements and defense (e.g. spending 
on education, infrastructure, transportation, R&D, housing, energy, environmental protection, job training, food, agriculture, childcare, justice, and 
international affairs), has shrunk to just 11 percent of the federal budget, 
down from 25 percent in the 1960s and 1970s. 73 As journalist Ezra Klein has 
pointed out, the U.S. government is becoming nothing more than an insurance company with an army. 74 Such a weak state might be great for lobbyists and large corporations, but not for the average American. 
 The United States thus faces a challenge: how to tackle national problems 
without a foreign bogeyman to unite the country and galvanize collective 
action. To meet this challenge, the United States needs to empower a centrist American majority, and doing that requires structural change to U.S. 
political institutions. What changes? 
 First, the United States needs to increase voter turnout. Currently the 
United States has some of the lowest turnout rates of any developed democracy; in recent U.S. presidential elections, including the 2016 election, just 
over half of voting age citizens cast ballots. Low turnout polarizes American politics, because extreme partisans are more likely than moderates to 
show up at the polls. Consequently, each party focuses on fi ring up its base 
rather than appealing to centrists. If the United States had near-universal 
voting, by contrast, politicians might spend more time courting the political 
center and developing compromise solutions to the nation’s problems. 
 The most straightforward way to boost turnout would be to make voting 
mandatory, a step that more than two dozen countries have taken to great 
effect. Unfortunately, a mandatory voting law is a political non-starter in 
the United States—taxes and jury duty are bad enough, the last thing 
Americans want is the government marching them to the polls. 
 More feasible would be a law that made voting easier by automatically 
registering people to vote when they receive a driver’s license or state ID 
and by holding elections on weekends or, better yet, on a new national holiday. The current practice of holding elections on Tuesdays, when most people have to work, is based on an obsolete 1845 law: at the time, Congress 
THE UNIPOLAR ERA
149
reasoned that Tuesday was the best day for voting, because Sunday was the 
Sabbath, Wednesday was market day, and people needed Monday to travel 
to town by horse-and-buggy to vote. Needless to say, times have changed. 
The U.S. electoral system should too. 
 Second, states should hold open nonpartisan primaries for all elections. 75
Currently, most states hold separate closed primaries for each party in 
which only registered party members can vote. Most of these voters are 
zealous partisans and they often elect extremists to represent their party in 
the general election, forcing the general public to choose between two bad 
options. States should replace this perverse system with a single primary 
ballot for all candidates, regardless of their party affi liation, and allow all 
voters to participate in primaries, not just registered party members. 
 Third, states should institute ranked-choice voting in all elections with 
runoffs. The current system is a “winner-take-all” model, in which the candidate that receives the most votes wins, even if he or she failed to receive a 
majority of the votes. Under this system, voters have to worry about the 
“spoiler effect,” in which they inadvertently help elect their least favorite 
candidate by casting a vote for an independent. 
 In ranked-choice voting, by contrast, voters would rank candidates in 
order of preference from fi rst to last. If no candidate receives a majority in 
the fi rst round, the candidate with the fewest fi rst choice votes is eliminated, and voters who ranked that candidate fi rst would have their second 
choices counted. This process repeats until one candidate reaches a majority and wins. 
 This system allows voters to support the candidate they like the best 
without worrying that their vote will help elect the candidate they like 
least. It also encourages candidates to avoid negative campaigning and 
seek broad public support to avoid alienating voters whose second- or 
third-place votes they may need to get elected. 
 Fourth, states should institute nonpartisan redistricting. Currently, most 
states allow the majority party to redraw districts to enhance its electoral 
prospects by “packing” voters from the other party into fewer districts. 
This practice, known as gerrymandering, fosters partisan extremism by creating “safe seats” for each party; when districts are packed with voters that 
overwhelmingly support one party, the winner of that party’s primary is 
virtually guaranteed to win the general election. As a result, representatives 
from gerrymandered districts pander to partisans rather than the general 
electorate. 
 Gerrymandering is as old as the Republic—the practice is named after 
Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry, who approved a district in 1812 that 
was so convoluted that a local newspaper said it looked like a salamander—
but computer technology has made it easier for politicians to pick their voters, and gerrymandering has clearly gotten out of hand: in 2016, fewer than 
10 percent of U.S. House races and only 28 percent of Senate general 
CHAPTER 6
150
election races were competitive. The rest were in safe seats, and the winner 
was effectively decided in the primary. 
 To increase the number of mixed districts, states should hand over redistricting responsibility to independent nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions, an approach that Arizona, California, Idaho, and Washington have 
already instituted. 
 Finally, Congress should diminish the role of money in politics by 
requiring full transparency for all political donations. Currently, politicians spend more than half their workdays soliciting donations from 
shadowy donors, who are allowed to funnel unlimited funds to groups 
called political actions committees, which back particular candidates on 
the sly. 76 In recent elections, Congressional campaigns raised more than 
$1 billion. 77 This money obviously was not earned at bake sales. Instead, 
according to a large body of research, most of it came from the coffers of 
rich ideologues and single-issue interest groups. 78 The research further 
shows that these donations exacerbate polarization and corruption by 
incentivizing candidates to cater to private interests at the extremes of the 
ideological spectrum. 79 Requiring public disclosure of political donations, 
so that voters know who is backing which candidate, would help reduce 
these incentives and drain the swamp of corruption currently inundating 
American politics. 
 World Order 
 Since the end of World War II, the United States has led multinational 
movements to expand free trade and investment and promote democracy 
and human rights. These efforts have fostered a global system of international institutions, commerce, and democratic nations that many observers 
now refer to as the liberal order. 80
 This liberal system has unleashed an unprecedented period of freedom 
and prosperity. 81 Prior to 1945, there had never been more than a dozen 
democracies in the world. Today there are over a hundred. Before 1950, 
global GDP had never risen by more than 1 percent a year. Since 1950, it has 
risen by an average of 4 percent per year. The liberal order is often criticized 
for causing the 2008 fi nancial crash. As my Tufts colleague Dan Drezner has 
shown, however, the institutions of the liberal order actually prevented the 
Great Recession from becoming another Great Depression. 82
 As the world’s sole superpower, the United States remains vastly more 
capable of supporting this liberal order than any other nation. The problem, 
however, is that it may have less incentive to do so given its vast stocks of 
wealth and secure location. In the coming decades, the United States could 
become a “global power without global interests,” turning inward while 
leaving others to pay the costs of maintaining the international system. 83
THE UNIPOLAR ERA
151
The “America fi rst” policy of the Donald Trump administration might be 
just a preview of what is to come. 84
 If the United States returns to its isolationist and protectionist roots, 
would the world revert to its traditional patterns of war, despotism, and 
poverty? 
 Some scholars think not. In their view, “the underlying foundations of 
the liberal international order will survive and thrive” even without U.S. 
support. 85 According to this logic, the institutions that constitute the liberal 
order have taken on a life of their own and will continue to regulate world 
politics; and other countries will pick up the slack and patrol the oceans, 
maintain open markets and borders, and champion liberal values even if 
the United States does not. 86 In short, the liberal order is self-sustaining. It 
succeeds because liberal ideas are so obviously the best organizing principles for world society. 87 It therefore does not require the support of a liberal 
hegemon. 88
 History, however, tells a different story. 89 Liberal order is extremely rare 
and has fl ourished under only one set of conditions—when a great power 
possesses both a globally dominant navy and a profound commitment to 
liberal values. 90 This situation has existed only twice in modern history—
during the Pax Britannica in the nineteenth century and after World War II. 
The British liberal order did not survive the decline of British power. 91 Can 
we be so sure that today’s liberal order would survive a collapse of American commitment? 92
 I would have more faith in such a rosy outcome if two of the most powerful countries in the world—China and Russia—did not espouse blatantly 
illiberal values. In just the past few years, these nations have murdered prodemocracy advocates, promoted a version of state capitalism that resembles sixteenth-century mercantilism, and used military force to seize foreign 
territory and close international waters. These actions provide a glimpse of 
a future “world in disarray” in which the United States no longer backs the 
liberal order. 93
 Americans are understandably frustrated with the current order, because 
the United States often pays more than other nations to sustain it. Allies 
sometimes free ride on U.S. protection. Trade partners sometimes pursue 
protectionist policies while tapping the American market and stealing U.S. 
technology. International institutions occasionally constrain U.S. freedom 
of action. Democracy promotion has produced mixed results, and nationbuilding has bogged the U.S. military down in costly quagmires. The burdens of hegemony have indeed taken a toll on the United States. Little 
wonder, then, that so many Americans voted for Trump and his promise to 
wall the United States off from global responsibilities. 
 The fundamental problem facing the United States is what scholars call 
the “hegemon’s dilemma”: the harder the United States tries to solve global 
problems, the more weaker nations can free ride on U.S. efforts, thus 
CHAPTER 6
152
forcing the United States to choose between getting exploited and letting 
the world burn. 94
 Fortunately, there is a way out of this dilemma. The United States can be 
both “system-maker and privilege-taker.” 95 It can pay a large share of system maintenance costs but take a disproportionate share of the benefi ts. It 
can practice “internationalism with a nationalist accent,” maintaining U.S. 
engagement with the liberal order but doing so on terms that more forcefully assert American interests. 96 How? 
 First and foremost, the United States can use the active denial strategy 
described earlier to orchestrate stable balances of power in Asia and Europe. 
As Brookings scholar Thomas Wright has shown, a peaceful global order 
depends on healthy regional orders. 97 An active denial strategy promotes 
such orders while husbanding U.S. resources and offl oading some of the 
costs and risks to local actors. 
 Second, the United States can aggressively punish unfair trade practices, 
but do so through the WTO rather than by unilaterally slapping tariffs on 
foreign goods. The unilateral approach favored by the Trump administration is akin to slashing a rival’s tires instead of suing him in court. Yes, the 
judicial process takes longer and may be less emotionally satisfying, but it 
prevents tit-for-tat escalation. The 1930s showed how unbridled trade wars 
can destroy the world economy and trigger violent confl ict. The United 
States does not need to revive such a world just to “win” on trade, given 
that it already wins roughly 80 percent of the cases it brings before the WTO 
and 40 percent of the cases other countries bring against it. 98 By contrast, 
China only wins 41 percent of the cases it brings and 23 percent of cases 
brought against it. 
 The Trump administration says tariffs are crucial to protect American 
workers. Working-class families, however, bear the brunt of trade wars, 
because they depend most on cheap imported food, clothing, and household items. A recent study found that in a world of no trade, the poorest 
tenth of consumers would lose a staggering 63 percent of their purchasing 
power, more than double what the richest consumers would lose. 99 Tariffs 
or quotas on raw materials and basic goods would also hurt downstream 
industries, which employ many more American workers than do upstream 
industries. For example, imposing tariffs on Chinese steel might help the 
147,000 Americans employed in the steel industry, but harm the 6.5 million 
Americans employed in steel-using industries. 100
 A better way to protect American workers would be to invest directly in 
them. As shown in chapter 5, the United States spends six times less than 
other rich nations as a percentage of GDP on job training, job-search assistance, and hiring and wage subsidies; and three times less on family benefi ts, such as childcare support and early education programs. Closing this 
investment gap would allow the United States to protect American workers 
without resorting to protectionism. 
THE UNIPOLAR ERA
153
 Third, the United States should maintain high levels of immigration, but 
prioritize high-skilled immigrants and refugees fl eeing war, famine, and 
other disasters. Currently the United States is doing the opposite; it is reducing immigration, capping visas for high-skilled workers, and selecting 
immigrants primarily on family connections rather than merit or need. This 
system is the worst of all worlds. By reducing immigration, the United States 
betrays its values and cuts itself off from a vital source of human capital. 101
By selecting immigrants primarily based on family ties, the United States 
ends up rejecting many desperate refugees and talented workers and, 
instead, taking in a disproportionate number of low-skill workers, thereby 
reducing the wages and benefi ts of low-skill native-born workers—the most 
vulnerable group in the American workforce. 102 
 The United States should reform this system by raising the annual cap on 
H-1B visas for high-skilled workers from 65,000 to at least 100,000 and shifting to a points-based immigration system similar to Canada’s, which 
admits immigrants based on a range of factors in addition to family ties, 
including education, age, language ability, and refugee status. Americans 
already support such a system in overwhelming numbers. 103 Politicians 
need to rally this centrist majority behind a comprehensive immigration 
reform bill. 
 Finally, the United States should double funding for its international 
affairs programs, including foreign aid, peacekeeping, and diplomacy. Currently the United States spends 0.3 percent of its GDP on these programs—10 
times less than it spends on the military—and the Trump administration 
wants to get this number down to 0.2 percent of GDP by slashing foreign 
aid, gutting the State Department, and reducing U.S. contributions to UN 
peacekeeping and World Bank development projects. 
 Instead of cutting the international affairs budget, the United States 
should double it, bringing total spending to 0.6 percent of GDP, which is 
what the United States spent during the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan. Aid, peacekeeping, and diplomacy are not frills or charity; they are 
vital tools of U.S. national security, because they prevent catastrophes (e.g. 
wars, terrorist attacks, refugee crises, pandemics) at a fraction of the cost of 
addressing them once full-blown. This rationale is backed by scientifi c 
research and was endorsed by 120 former three- and four-star generals and 
admirals in an open letter to Congress in 2017. 104
 Advocates of a “Fortress America” model, in which the United States 
limits its international engagement to military strikes, forget that many of 
America’s greatest foreign policy victories were won through sustained 
diplomacy and aid. 105 The Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the country. The Marshal Plan and the formation of NATO and the Bretton Woods 
institutions contained communism. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
slowed the spread of nuclear weapons. Richard Nixon’s opening to China 
swung the Cold War in America’s favor. 
CHAPTER 6
154
 By contrast, military power has often failed to secure U.S. interests. The 
United States sent millions of troops to Vietnam and still lost. Military victory in the 1991 Persian Gulf War did not produce a sustainable peace. The 
2003 invasion of Iraq incited a brutal insurgency and enhanced Iranian 
infl uence. The U.S. military has occupied Afghanistan for nearly two 
decades, yet the Taliban controls more territory today than at any time since 
9/11. American airstrikes helped topple the government of Libya in 2011, 
and now the country is a hotbed of Islamic radicalism. 
 These missions failed not because the U.S. military lacked valor or skill, 
but because the United States did not turn battlefi eld success into durable 
political settlements. Unrivaled military power counts for little if it is not 
buttressed by aid and diplomacy. The U.S. Foreign Service is an indispensable guardian of American interests and should be funded as such. 
 Interests aside, Americans might spare a thought for how history will 
remember them. When the sun fi nally sets on the American empire, the fi rst 
paragraph of its obituary will surely be about America’s unprecedented 
wealth and power. But the second paragraph, about America’s purpose, 
remains up for grabs. The United States may have built the liberal order, 
but now it threatens to abandon it. It may have lifted the world onto a 
higher plane of peace and prosperity, championed democracy and human 
rights, and welcomed immigrants of all colors and creeds, but now it ranks 
22nd in foreign aid, coddles dictators, and bans refugees based on their 
religion. Every great power leaves a legacy. What will America’s be? 
 Compared to slaying the forces of fascism and communism, maintaining 
the liberal order may seem like an underwhelming call to greatness. It is not 
a mission that Americans are any more eager to undertake than the great 
geopolitical campaigns of the twentieth century. But it is just as virtuous 
and just as vital.

 1. A group of scholars are producing a new version of the Inclusive Wealth Report using 
modifi ed methods. See Managi 2018. I received a draft manuscript of this new report, but have 
decided not to use the data, because the new methods have produced nonsensical results. For 
example, according to the 2018 report, India is eight times wealthier than China and 5.5 times 
wealthier than the United States; Congo is supposedly twice as wealthy as the United States on 
a per capita basis; and Niger has fi ve times the per capita human capital of the United States! I 
contacted the editor of the report, Shunsuke Managi, inquiring about these bizarre results, and 
159
NOTES TO PAGES 34–42
his response led me to believe that the new methods massively overweight the economic value 
of population growth. Here is his response in full: “Basically, the reason for confusion comes 
from the Health Capital data. This health capital is the main contributor to the very high 
human capital of India and African countries. The longevity effect of health capital is measured 
in Stochastic Frontier Approach. So, the growing number of young population in India and 
Africa generating higher values, which show the discounted current value for health which is 
part of IW.” Email correspondence with author on January 10, 2018.

 51. For example, each iPhone adds nearly $300 to the U.S. trade defi cit with China, but 
manufacturers in China receive only $10 or less per phone. As one study of the iPhone’s production chain concludes: “While these products, including most of their components, are manufactured in China, the primary benefi ts go to the U.S. economy as Apple continues to keep 
most of its product design, software development, product management, marketing and other 
high-wage functions in the U.S.” See Kraemer, Linden, and Dedrick 2011, 2. See also, Xing

 55. To put China’s investment rate in perspective, consider that Soviet investment was only 
15 percent of GDP in 1950, under Stalin, and topped out in 1981 at 33 percent. Japan, South 
Korea, and Taiwan had investment rates around 35 percent during their high-growth years. 
Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore experienced investment rates greater than 40 percent for a 
few years at a time, but these investment drives were short short-lived phenomena and 
stemmed mostly from an infl ux of foreign investment. By contrast, China has maintained an 
average investment rate above 40 percent since 1990, and most of this investment comes from 
domestic sources. On these points, see Naughton 2016, 108.

 115. Vegetarianism is rare in China. The idea that an individual would deliberately abstain 
from eating meat seems counterintuitive, even offensive, in a culture where meat has been a 
sign of prosperity for millennia. Meat is now central to almost every middle-class meal, and 
pork is so important to Chinese society that the government maintains a strategic pork reserve

 127. Specifi cally, I include the combined budgets of the Departments of Defense, State, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, Justice, and the U.S. intelligence community; the Department 
of Energy’s budget for the maintenance and modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal; state 
and local spending on law enforcement and prisons; and the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, which funded the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and continues to support a 
variety of defense programs and operations. The Department of Homeland Security funds U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection, Immigration, the Secret Service, the Air Marshals, the Coast 
Guard, and the Transportation Security Agency. The Department of Justice funds the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Bureau of Prisons; the Drug Enforcement Agency; the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; and the U.S. Marshals Service. The U.S. Intelligence 
Community consists of sixteen agencies: the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security 
Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Twenty-Fifth Air Force, the Intelligence and Security Command, Coast Guard Intelligence, the Offi ce of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, 
the Offi ce of Intelligence Analysis, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the Offi ce of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, the Offi ce of National Security Intelligence, the Intelligence 
Branch of the FBI, the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency, the National Reconnaissance Offi ce, and the Offi ce of Naval Intelligence. Most of these 
agencies are funded through the budgets of the U.S. Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, or Justice. Although the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are offi cially over, the OCO budget 
remains, coming in at around $59 billion in 2016. Part of this funding supports ongoing operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan, but at least half of it is being used to pay for routine 
defense programs. For this reason, some analysts characterize OCO spending as a “slush fund” 
that enables the Department of Defense to get around budget caps. On this point, see Korb and 
Goepel 2016; Alexander 2010.

“welfare” includes only personnel and housing costs. For the United States, “weapons” 
includes R&D and procurement costs. For China, “weapons” includes R&D and procurement 
costs plus construction costs and the costs of maintenance, transportation, and storage of 
equipment. For the United States, “operations” includes operation costs plus the costs of maintenance, transportation, and storage of equipment. China’s “operations” category only 
includes the costs of current operations. See Blasko et al. 2006 and Liff and Erickson 2013 for a

12,000 crashed aircraft, and the lives of 8,500 personnel to reduce aircraft accident rates on carriers to the same level as land-based aircraft; and studies show that naval pilots with 4,500 
hours of fl ight time are three times less likely to crash on a carrier, twice as accurate in bombing 
exercises, and fi ve times less likely to be shot down in simulated air-to-air combat than pilots 
with only 500 hours of fl ying time. On these points, see Cliff 2015, 106.

sources, including the World Bank, the World Economic forum, and the Economist Intelligence 
Unit. According to the 2015 version of this index, the Chinese public sector is more than twice 
as corrupt as the U.S. government.

 46. “China: Sub Fleet Grows, Still in U.S. Wake,” Stratfor. China’s fi ve tactical nuclearpowered submarines have 6 torpedo tubes. Most analysts believe that the PLA puts missiles in 
4 of these tubes and torpedoes in the remaining 2 tubes. By contrast, U.S. Virginia- and LosAngeles-class submarines have 4 torpedo tubes and 12 vertical-launch cells dedicated solely to 
missiles, and U.S. Ohio-class submarines have 4 torpedo tubes and 154 vertical-launch cells 
fi lled with missiles. China is currently developing a new tactical nuclear-powered submarine, 
the Type 093B, which appears to have a vertical-launch system with 12 to 16 missile cells. It is 
unknown when this submarine will be deployed, however.

 63. Finding, identifying, targeting, and striking a moving ship is a diffi cult task, so one 
should not assume that China’s antiship ballistic missile is a one-shot, one-kill weapon. The 
seas near China encompass more than 5 million square miles, and thousands of ships pass 
through them every day. China’s over-the-horizon skywave radar system has targeting errors 
ranging between ten to sixty-fi ve miles, so it is not accurate enough to identify ships in the vast 
expanse of the East and South China Seas where U.S. ships would operate, let alone guide a 
ballistic missile to a U.S. aircraft carrier conducting evasive maneuvers and deploying all manner of radar jammers, decoys, countermeasures, and defensive systems. China has satellites 
that could provide targeting information for antiship missiles, but these satellites collectively 
provide images of a given point on earth only once every 2.6 hours, assuming perfect weather, 
and often only once every few days. For now, therefore, China’s cruise missiles launched from 
ships and aircraft are much larger threats to U.S. aircraft carriers in Asia than China’s shorebased antiship ballistic missile. For a discussion of the challenges facing China’s antiship ballistic missile system, see Heginbotham et al. 2015, 154–71. 
 64. The United States has deployed 330 stealth fi ghters and 20 stealth bombers and plans to 
procure more than 2,500 stealth fi ghters and 100 “next generation” stealth bombers by the 
2020s. At present, these aircraft can penetrate Chinese air space undetected. The United States 
also has converted four Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines into “underwater arsenal 
ships” that can loiter undetected in China’s littorals and fi re salvos of 154 Tomahawk missiles 
at China’s missile batteries, radar installations, and bases. These submarines will be decomissioned between 2026 and 2028, but by then the United States will have deployed 22 new Virginia-class submarines each with expanded payloads of 40 Tomahawk missiles, supplementing 
the current fl eet of 12 Virginia-class boats. The U.S. Air Force currently has 1,450 air-launched 
cruise missiles with ranges greater than 500 miles and is planning to purchase 3,000 more by 
the 2020s. The U.S. Navy currently has 700 air-launched cruise missiles with a range of 230 
miles and has procured an initial batch of 30 new antiship air-launched cruise missile with a 
range of 570 miles. As noted earlier, U.S. ships and submarines already carry Tomahawk missiles with a range greater than 1,000 miles. On U.S. strike aircraft, see Majumdar 2015a; Heginbotham et al. 2015, 112. On U.S. submarines, see Beng 2015. On U.S. missiles, see Heginbotham 
et al. 2015, 106; Jane’s Air-Launched Weapons, “AGM-158C Long Range Antiship Missile,” 
February 6, 2016. 
 65. The U.S. Navy has aquired 114 EA-18G Growler aircraft, which are converted F/A-18Fs 
that accompany and cloak strike aircraft in a cloud of eletromagnetic noise. In 2021, the U.S. 
military will equip its fi ghter aircraft with the Next Generation Jammer, which can conduct 
both electromagnetic and cyber attacks against enemy radars, and active phased array radars 
that allow aircraft to broadcast powerful radar signals while remaining stealthy. See Clark and 
Gunzinger 2015.

 79. The PLA only has 4 fi xed-wing antisubmarine aircraft, which are similar to U.S. Cold 
War-era P-3C Orions, and 70 antisubmarine helicopters, which have limited combat radii (100–
200 miles) and endurance (2–3 hours). These platforms have limited radar ranges (15–20 miles), 
so the PLA would have trouble fi nding U.S. submarines, let alone targeting them. China’s diesel-powered submarines are poor antisubmarine platforms because they are slow and have 
limited endurance and would have extreme diffi culty fi nding U.S. submarines. On the near 
invulnerability to U.S. submarines to Chinese antisubmarine warfare, see Cote 2011; Goldstein 
2011; Mizokami 2017. 
 80. The United States has turned China’s near seas into a “sensor-rich” environment by 
combining the existing U.S. underwater Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) with hordes of 
new drones carrying thermal and optical sensors, active and passive sonar, magnetic anomaly 
detectors, and wake detection, light detection, and ranging systems. The navy has acquired 
roughly 160 aerial drones and 16 underwater drones, all of which can be deployed from submarines and perform reconnaissance over hundreds of miles. The U.S. military also has developed drone submarines (the Large Displacement Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) and 
unmanned surface ships (Anti-submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel) that 
can autonomously patrol for enemy submarines for 90 days and sweep areas of thousands of 
square miles. See Eckstein 2016; Gady 2016.

 83. The United States is building two Virginia-class submarines per year from 2012 to 2025 
and three submarines every two years thereafter until 2046. Submarines built after 2018 will 
have extra vertical-launch tubes, increasing their missile capacity from 12 to 40. The United 
States also will operate four Ohio-class cruise missile submarines, each with 154 Tomahawks, 
until at least 2025. The U.S. Navy will suffer a submarine “shortfall” in the mid-2020s, as Cold 
War-era Los Angeles-class submarines are retired. The total number of attack submarines will 
drop from 52 in 2017 to 41 in 2029 before rising back to 48 in 2037 and exceeding 50 in the 2040s. 
To put those numbers in perspective, the United States had 100 attack submarines at the height 
of the Cold War. To offset this temporary shortfall, the navy has accelerated production of Virginias, extended the service life of some Los Angeles-class submarines by one or two years each, 
lengthened submarine deployments from six to eight months, and procured 12 large undersea 
drones (the Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle) to be deployed in 2025. These 
measures ensure that the United States will have at least 32 attack submarines ready for war at 
all times, and this updated fl eet will be more capable than America’s larger Cold War-era fl eet, 
because Virginia-class boats are quieter and have more than three times the armaments of the 
Los Angeles-class boats they are replacing, and Virginias use fl y-by-wire ship control systems 
that provide better shallow-water ship handling and carry more advanced sonar arrays. On 
these points, see O’Rourke 2016, 7–15; Cavas 2016a; Osborn 2016; Majumdar 2015b.

 149. Seven cases took place during the world wars, but both wars were won on the ground. 
Italy bombed Ethiopia in 1936, but had to invade it to conquer the country. The Soviet Union 
bombed Afghanistan throughout the 1980s, but withdrew in defeat in 1989. The U.S. military 
bombed North Korea during the Korean War and conducted two bombing campaigns against 
North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, but failed to win either confl ict. In the Gulf War, a 
U.S.-led coalition bombed Iraq, but had to invade Iraq to accomplish their aims. In the 1999 
Kosovo War, NATO bombed Yugoslavia for seventy-eight days, but other factors ultimately 
impelled Yugoslavia’s surrender, including the threat of a NATO ground invasion; pressure 
from Russia, Yugoslavia’s vital ally; fi nancial sanctions on Serbian political elites; and concessions by NATO that eventually made the terms of surrender more palatable. Moreover, the 
Kosovo case cannot be neatly applied to a China-Taiwan war, as NATO was not seeking 
to conquer Yugoslavia, and Yugoslavia was a weak nation led by an especially vulnerable 
regime.

 183. The Yangtze is China’s sole navigable river and cuts through mountain chains and 
ridges on its path to the sea. Along many stretches, it lacks a fl oodplain even wide enough for 
a footpath. The elevation means that many of the basin’s “nine thousand miles of navigability” 
are seasonal; if you eliminate any Yangtze River basin waterways that lack a channel of at least 
nine feet of depth for nine months of the year, that fi gure drops to seventeen hundred, and the 
number of navigable tributaries drops from over one hundred to just one. While it seems huge 
on a map, the area of usable territory it empowers is less than that of the Elbe. Aside from a 
short stretch of the Pearl River in the far south, none of the many southern Chinese rivers are 
navigable. On these points, see Zeihan 2015, 295–96.

 193. These veto players include a president with equal democratic legitimacy to Congress; a 
powerful upper house of Congress whose approval is needed on virtually all legislation; an 
independent judiciary that can overturn legislative acts; and a federal system that allocates 
powers to state and local governments. Most parliamentary systems have far fewer veto players, and are therefore able to pass legislation more easily. In such systems, the executive branch 
is not a competing power center, but rather the administrative instrument of the legislative 
majority. On these points, see Fukuyama 2013.

 272. OECD 2017. India does not participate in PISA, but India almost certainly would score 
much lower than the other major powers. Almost 70 percent of India’s working-age population 
has not attended high school and nearly 50 percent of prime working-age adults (ages to 54) 
has no education at all. Only 12 percent of Indian eighth graders can read at a fi rst-grade level 
and only 20 percent could recognize numbers above ten. On India’s educational failings, see

 8. Violence of all kinds has declined over the course of human history. Changing social 
norms, the rise of the nation-state, and the spread of commerce help explain this long-term 
trend. On these points, see Pinker 2011. However, I do not think they fully explain the sudden 
drop in warfare after 1991. 
 9. Between 1989 and 1999, the number of democracies in the world and the level of globalization (measured in international fl ows of trade, fi nance, people, and data) both increased by roughly 
60 percent and the number of peacekeeping operations doubled. On democracy, see Roser 2017. On 
globalization, see KOF Index of Globalization 2017. On peacekeeping operations, see UN 2017. On
