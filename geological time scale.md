_Periods of the Paleozoic Era -_
Cambrian
Ordovician
Silurian
Devonian
Carboniferous
Permian (First fish: Ordovician; first trace of life on land: Silurian period; Amphibians evolved in Devonian period; Coal during the Carboniferous period; Reptiles dominated amphibians during Permian Period)
_Periods of the Mesozoic Era_
Triassic-Jurassic-Cretaceous (the time of dinosaurs on earth; Reptiles started too high in number during Triassic; Age of Dinosaurs during Jurassic Park; Extinction of Dinosaurs during the Cretaceous period)
_Periods of Cainozoic Era_
Tertiary

Quarternary Period: Holocene epoch-Pleistocene epoch.(We are currently living in Holocene Epoch)
Holocene Epoch is divided into 3 smaller subdivisions which are called Age:

Greenlandian (from 11700- 8200)

Northgrippean (8200-4000)

Meghalayan (4200-Present)-> evidence found in Mawluh cave in Meghalaya, India.
