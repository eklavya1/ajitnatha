## INTRODUCTION
(1:05 PM)
## UNEMPLOYMENT
(1:14 PM)
Unemployment rate = Unemployed people/ labour force = people willing to work but not having work/ people willing to work.
Unemployment rate = Unemployed/employed + unemployed.

## Demographic dividend in India
(1:43 PM)
- [[=unrivaled]] [[=the next 100 years book]]
- India enjoys three key advantages over other countries when it comes to favourable demographic structure.
- avrag age (median age) of d wrking-age pplation is sgnfcntly lowr dn d avrge age of d wrkng-age pplation o odr countries.
- d size of d working-age population is significntly larger for India as compared to any other country.
- China's labour force is decreasing, ageing & becoming more expensive - presents an opportunity for India to usher in labour-intensive industry.
- India is expected to remain young for significntly longer time than what other countries remained for at their peak i.e., d working-age population, d median age is expected to remain low for very long time. 
- Even in [[2060]], it is expected that d median working age would be around 35-40 years. 
- ∴, we have about 40 years for which we cn reap d demographic dividend.
- Due to this reason, there is special focus on skill development as well as degradation (? upgradation ??) of skills.
## Fertility rate's impact on economy / working-age population
(2:03 PM)
- sharp fall in d number of people in d working-age group is usually result of d lower fertility rate of d [[population]].
- lower fertility rate cn be enforced through order i.e. an authority - such as d one-child norm in china or it cn be achieved organically with rising standards of living in d society such as in Japan & Denmark.
- When standards of living improve, d desirability of more children at d society level is usually seen to fall (most necessary at d individual level but is generally seen at d societal level)

**It may be partly explained in d following -**
- With increasing standards of living, d cost to main such standards is high.
- Having more children increases d financial burden & at d same time reduces d time spent on work, reducing incomes. [[=the next 100 years book]]
- ∴, people themselves prefer lesser number of children.
- Total fertility rate TFR = expected number of children that woman is going to bear during her reproductive age. 
- TFR of 2.1 is considered as *replacement rate* i.e., couple (two people) producing two children.
## Statistical system of India
(2:15 PM)
 - _related_ [[pc mahalanobis]] | [[statistics]] | [[data science]] [[zipf's law]] [[pareto principle]]
- d responsibility of collection & presentation of statistics is primarily of MOSPI ([[45. Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation]]
- MoSPI has two important divisions.
	- One for collection of data - [[national sample survey organisation]].
	- For coalition & presentation of data for meaningful inference - [[Central statistics office]].
- Most of d surveys regarding macroeconomic indicators such as assessment of [[poverty]] through NCES, assessment of unemployment through PFLS (earlier through EUS), inflation data, estimates of output etc are carried out by NSSO & then refined & combined by CSO.
- There is also d National statistics commission which advises NSSO & CSO regarding d methodology of statistics collection & combination.
- Statistics collection requires collecting information from samples.
- Creating samples & d manner of collecting information from them is subject to bias.
- Biases are minimised by increasing d sample size & making it as representative as possible.
- PLFS, which is now used to estimate [[unemployment]] has much larger & diverse sample size than EUS which was used for estimating unemployment till 2012.
- PLFS also has higher frequency of data collection & that makes it more accurate than EUS.
## Randomised controlled trials
(2:43 PM)
- d randomised control trial (RCT) is trial in which subjects are randomly assigned to one of two groups.
- One (the experimental group) receives d intervention that is being tested, & d other (the comparison group or control) receives an alternative (conventional) treatment.
- d two groups are then followed up to see if there are any differences between them in d outcome.
- d results & subsequent analysis of d trial are used to assess d effectiveness of d intervention, which is d extent to which treatment, procedure, or service does patients more good than harm.
- RCTs are d most stringent way of determining whether cause-effect relation exists between d intervention & d outcome.
## dependency ratio
[[Dependency ratio##economics 09]]
## Usual Status approach 
- d activity status is determined on d basis of reference period of 1 year.
- d status of activity on which person has spent relatively long time in d preceding 365 days prior to d date of d survey is considered as usual principal activity status.
 ## current weekly status (CWS) approach
- It uses d 7 preceding days of d survey as d rfrnce priod.
- person is considered to be employed if he / she is pursuing any gainful activity for at least one day in reference week.
