phosphorus cycle is biogeochemical cycle that describes movement of phosphorus through [[lithosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], & [[biosphere]]. unlike many other biogeochemical cycles, atmosphere does not play a significant role in movement of phosphorus, because phosphorus & phosphorus-based compounds are usually solids at typical ranges of temperature & pressure found on earth. production of phosphine gas occurs in only specialized, local conditions. therefore, phosphorus cycle should be viewed from whole earth system & then specifically focused on cycle in terrestrial & aquatic systems.

living organisms require phosphorus, a vital component of [[dna]], [[rna]], etc, for their proper functioning. plants assimilate phosphorus as phosphate & incorporate it into organic compounds & in animals, phosphorus is a key component of bones, teeth, etc. on land, phosphorus gradually becomes less available to plants over thousands of years, since it is slowly lost in runoff. low concentration of phosphorus in soils reduces plant growth & slows soil microbial growth, as shown in studies of soil microbial biomass. soil microorganisms act as both sinks & sources of available phosphorus in biogeochemical cycle. short-term transformation of phosphorus is chemical, biological, or microbiological. in long-term global cycle, however, major transfer is driven by tectonic movement over geologic time.humans have caused major changes to global phosphorus cycle through shipping of phosphorus minerals, & use of phosphorus fertilizer, & also shipping of food from farms to cities, where it is lost as [[effluent]].
