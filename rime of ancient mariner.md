- the rime of the ancient mariner (originally the rime of the ancyent marinere) is the longest major poem by the english poet samuel taylor coleridge, written in [[1797]]–[[1798]] and published in 1798 in the first edition of lyrical ballads. some modern editions use a revised version printed in [[1817]] that featured a gloss. along with other poems in lyrical ballads, it is often considered a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of british romantic literature.

- the rime of the ancient mariner recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. the mariner stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. the wedding-guest’s reaction turns from bemusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem.
