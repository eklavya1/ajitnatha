- absolute monarchy (or absolutism as a doctrine) is a form of monarchy in which the monarch rules in their own right. in this kind of monarchy, the king or queen is usually limited by a constitution (since modern times). however, in some absolute monarchies, the king or queen is by no means limited and has absolute power. these are often hereditary monarchies. on the other hand, in constitutional monarchies, in which the authority of the head of state is also bound or restricted by the constitution, a legislator or unwritten customs, the king or queen is not the only one to decide, and their entourage also exercises power, mainly the prime minister.
- absolute monarchy in europe declined substantially following the [[french revolution]] and [[world war 1]], both of which led to the popularization of theories of [[government]] based on the notion of popular sovereignty.
