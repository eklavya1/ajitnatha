	-   vedic brahmanism - drawing its identity from vedic corpus - was a religious form associated with socially dominant groups, supporting practices & beliefs that could be seen as orthodoxy, there have been movements that have distanced themselves in various ways from vedic brahmanism. **shramana group - buddhism, jainism & various 'heterodox' sects - is 1 such well-established group.** shramanas did not regard brahmans as being of highest status. shramanas included a variety of ascetics, as well as monks & lay followers of various sects - buddhist, jaina, [[ajivika]] & others.
	-   monks renounced social obligations to take on alternative life when they joined order. they lived as equal members of order, denying caste distinctions. but they lived in monasteries near villages & towns so that they could draw on support of lay community, namely, those who were buddhists or jainas but were not initiated into renunciatory groups. **lay followers were referred to as upasaka & upasika.**
