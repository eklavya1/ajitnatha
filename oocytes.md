- An oocyte (UK: , US: ), o√∂cyte, or ovocyte is a female gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction. In other words, it is an immature ovum, or egg cell. An oocyte is produced in a female fetus in the ovary during female gametogenesis. The female germ cells produce a primordial germ cell (PGC), which then undergoes mitosis, forming oogonia.  During oogenesis, the oogonia become primary **oocytes**. An oocyte is a form of genetic material that can be collected for cryoconservation.
