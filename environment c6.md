# Conservation Reserve and Community Reserve
(1:06 PM)

## Conservation Reserves:
- Conservation Reserves can be declared by the State Governments in any area owned by the [[government]], particularly the areas adjacent to national parks and sanctuaries, and those areas which link one protected area with another. 
- As per Wildlife Protection Amendment Act [[2002]], these have been provided. 
- Such declaration shall be made after having consultations with the local communities. 
_- No human settlement, it is government land._
- E.g. Beas Conservation Reserve.
## Community Reserves:
- Community reserves can be declared by the state government in any private or community land, not comprised within a national park, sanctuary, or conservation reserve, where an individual or a community has â€˜volunteeredâ€™ to conserve the wildlife and its habitat.
- Land can be protected by the government as a â€˜community reserveâ€™
-  #pre Indiaâ€™s first Community reserve was notified in Gurdaspur [[punjab]]: â€˜Keshopur Mianiâ€™ Community Reserve (recently it has also been declared as a Ramsar wetland Site).  #pre  _related_ [[ramsar convention|ramsar sites]] | [[ramsar convention]]
- Community: With the land owned by the local community, a private entity.

# Forest Laws
(1:28 PM)
## Indian Forest Act, 1927:
- The legal definition of â€˜[[forest]]â€™ is not available in India, however, types have been provided.
- Classification of forests into
	- protected,
	- private forests,
	- government forests, etc. was done.
- Forest produce is divided into:
	- timber
	- non-timber forest produce.
- [[bamboo]] was considered timber in this law, but now the Government of India has classified bamboo as non-timber.
- Bamboo grown in forest land, one requires permission for using/extracting the [[resource]].
## Forest Conservation Act, 1980:
- This empowers the Central government to convert forest [[land]] for the economic role, e.g. infrastructure, mining, etc.
- Loss of forest land, due to economic activities need to be â€˜compensatedâ€™.
- Central and State level _Campa_ (not a typo !) has been created to utilize funds for conservation.
	- Campa: It is the statutory body, _Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority._
- 80 percent of CAMPA funds to be utilized only for afforestation, plantation.
- Rest 20 percent will be for capacity building, training of staff, etc.
- These forests occupy about 29% of the total forest area of the country.
- Such types of forests are called as protected forests.

## Scheduled Tribes and Other Forest Dwellers (Recognition of their Rights) Act, 2006: 
- Recognition of rights of ST and other forest dwellers was provided.
- It was to be recognized through the Gram Sabha.
## Protected Forest:
2:02 PM
- [[scheduled tribes]]
- Protected Forests are those forests that are looked after by the government, but the local people are allowed to collect fuelwood and graze their [[cattle]] without causing serious damage to the forest.
- these forests occupy about 29% of the total forest area of the country
## Reserved Forest:
- These are those forests that are under the direct supervision of the [[government]] and no public entry is allowed for the collection of timber or grazing of cattle.
- About 53% of the total forest area falls in this category.

# Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ):
 _related_ [[SEZ special economic zones]]
- This concept comes from Dr. Madhav Gadgilâ€™s Report on Protection of the Western Ghats, which was reviewed by Dr. Kasturirangan.
- It is notified under Environment Protection Act [[1986]]. 
- Objective: To control human activities around the boundary of National Parks and Sanctuaries. 
- ESZs are areas around national parks or wildlife sanctuaries to prevent ecological damage caused due to developmental activities. 
- ESZs are ecologically important areas to be protected from industrial pollution and unregulated development. 
- ESZs can be declared outside of National Parks/Wildlife Sanctuaries upto 10 Km.
- They also act as a transition area between high protected areas to less protected areas.
- The basic aim is to regulate the negative impacts of activities on the fragile ecosystem of the protected area.
# Biodiversity Hotspot:
3:05 PM
- The concept of [[biodiversity]] Hotspots was termed by Dr. [[Norman Myers]] ([[1988]]). #pre 
- It is a biogeographic region, with a significant reservoir of biodiversity, that is threatened with destruction. 
- These hotspots which cover less than 2% of the worldâ€™s land area, are found to have about 50% of the terrestrial biodiversity.
- They are overseen by Conservation International.
- The projects of Conservation International are funded by: Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF).
## There are two strict criteria for determining hotspot: 
-  First: Endemism (criteria: must have at least 1500 species of _vascular_ plants as [[endemic]], i.e. less than 0.5% of the total global vascular plants), vascular are well-developed plants. (They contain xylem and phloem - vascular bundle)
- Second: Threatened (Criteria: Degree of threat, which is measured in terms of habitat loss i.e. More than 70% of its original [[vegetation]] has been lost).
- [[biogeographic zones of india]]
- As of now, there are 36 Global Biodiversity Hotspots, in India, we have 4 of such:
	- [[western ghats]],
	- [[himalaya]]s,
	- [[Indo-Burma]],
	- [[Sundaland]] (including Andaman).
- Himalaya: Includes the entire Himalayan region, and that falling in Pakistan, Tibet (China), Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar. 
- Indo-Burma: Includes entire North-East India except Assam, also includes Andaman group of islands, and Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Southern China.
- Sundaland: Includes Nicobar group of islands, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Philippines.  
- Western Ghats and Srilanka: It includes the entire Western Ghats and Sri Lanka.

- Hottest Hotspots: Eight of them have been declared as â€˜hottest hotspotâ€™, which means they have very high levels of endemism and are the most threatened by human activities/climate change, etc.
- Eight â€˜Hottest Hotspotsâ€™:
	- Indo-Burma,
	-  Sundaland,
	-  Atlantic Forest of Brazil,
	-  Madagascar,
	-  Philippines,
	-  Caribbean Islands,
	-  Western Ghats,
	-  Sri lanka,
	-  Eastern Arc,
	-  Coastal Forests of Tanzania/Kenya.

# Hope spots:
4:02 PM
- The concept was given by Dr. Sylvia Earle during her TED Talk in 2009.
- Promoted by Sylvia Earle Alliance _Mission Blue_ and [[iucn]].
- Hope spots are marine ecosystems, rich in biodiversity (underwater species, diversity) which need urgent protection.
- Andaman Nicobar and Lakshwadeep are declared as Hopespots.
