lagrange points are positions where gravitational pull of 2 large masses precisely equals centripetal force required for a small object to move with them.
these are positions in space where gravitational forces of a two-body system like sun & earth produce enhanced regions of attraction & repulsion. #doubt 
these can be used by spacecraft to reduce fuel consumption needed to remain in position.
there are 5 special points where a small mass can orbit in a constant pattem with 2 larger masses.
of 5 lagrange points, 3 are unstable & 2 are stable.
unstable lagrange points are ll, l2, & l3, & stable lagrange points are l4 & l5.
ll point of earth-sun system provides an uninterrupted view of sun.

lagrange points are positions in space where objects sent there tend to stay put. at lagrange points, gravitational pull of 2 large masses precisely equals centripetal force required for a small object to move with them. these points in space can be used by spacecraft to reduce fuel consumption needed to remain in position.
