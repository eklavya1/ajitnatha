## Shortcomings of the State’s approach

A casual approach towards Naxalism.
States have more knowledge about local areas, terrain, etc.

Questions: 

Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) is showing a downward trend, what are the steps taken by the government for the same?
Is non-implementation of the Fifth Schedule one of the reasons for the spread of Left Wing Extremism?
Do you agree that the establishment of large-scale industries in backward areas is one of the reasons for people taking up the path of Naxalism? Discuss. 

## Solutions to Left Wing Extremism
Solutions to Left Wing Extremism: (10:31 AM)

Incentives to officers posted in LWE areas.
The Forest Rights Act needs to be revised, to include more rights to the tribals.
For example, minor forest produce, timber, etc. are to be recognized in the names of tribals.
In the name of conservation, the rights of tribals should not be taken away.
Forest Rights Act-2006 has also become a tool of bureaucratic exploitation.
For example, approvals are to be taken from the State Forest Department.
Mafia and bureaucratic nexus can result in the failure of the Forest Rights Act.
The Central Tribal Advisory Council should be formed to provide leadership.
Duplication of schemes and efforts should be minimized.
The Supreme Court directed the complete disbanding of Salwa Judum, citing it is the State’s responsibility to fight Naxals, not the common people.
