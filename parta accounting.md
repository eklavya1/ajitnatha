Introduction to Parta System: The late Mr. Ghanashyam Das Birla, the grandfather of the late Mr. Aditya Birla developed 'Parta' system.  Parta means what will be the return of pocket in net. Parta is a system of establishing return on Investment based on Cost Management. Parta is the financial performance monitoring system for any organization which indicates Profit/ Loss on daily basis. This helps in keeping a track of the organization on a daily basis. Parta could be of different types:

1. Production based - Capacity of each equipment based on guarantee of production if given by the manufacturer of machinery. Manufacturers study the factors that enabled overshooting of rated production.  Estimate of investment will give in the capacity of project (Where supply is in short of demand). - Birla super.
2. 2. Market Based - With increased capacity in items where demand was lesser than supply, it was based on market research and projected estimates.  Dynamics of changes in policy may give further moderation like Birla White. Working of Parta to get details of:
		 - (1) Input Raw Material
			 - (a) Capacity Utilisation;
			 - (b) Plant number of days running in year. 
		 - (2) Production Cost,
			 - (a) Capacity Utilisation;
			 - (b) Plant number of days running in year.
		 - (3) Selling and Administrative Cost per Unit of Product;
			 - (1) Fixed;
			 - (2) Variable.
			 - (4) Marketing and Advertising Costs:
- One-Time and Regular. Excellence & Constraints in System: Parta is a convenient and efficient mechanism for control and monitoring. The simplicity and continuity in control mechanism on a regular basis made the system very popular in adoption of it throughout a wide section of industries in earlier days. The business environment started to be complex due to intense competition from domestic and international players. Various parameters which need to be controlled become larger and a simple structure of Parta system seemed to be inadequate to handle them.
- To over come the  limitations of Parta system, Lean Management Accounting System started getting momentum in its acceptability in India. Introduction to Lean Management Accounting: Lean Management Accounting brings together accounting, control and performance measurement methods that support the introduction of lean manufacturing and sustain a lean enterprise approach over the long term. Lean management accounting must not only actively support lean manufacturing; it must itself employ lean methods. What is Lean Thinking? Lean Management Accounting is driven by the principles of lean thinking, as set forth by Womack.
- The five principles of lean thinking presented by Womack are:
	- 1. Value: Value deals with the value, which a company provides to its customers.
	- 2. Value stream: Value stream recognizes that the company's processes create excellence and customer-driven performance.
	- 3. Flow: Anything that interrupts the flow of products and services through the value stream and out to the customer is designated as a waste which is to be eliminated.
	- 4. Pull: Pull (not push) is an important mechanism to enable flow of the products and services.
	- 5. Perfection: Perfection within lean thinking has two elements.
		(i) TQM;
		(ii) Bench Marking.

# What is lean management accounting?
Lean Management Accounting is a series of methods designed to support lean thinking. Lean management accounting methods must themselves be lean and not introduce additional waste. Lean management accounting seeks to eliminate transactions while maintaining control of the operation, recognizing that control of a value stream (or process) does not always require keeping detailed transaction information. Example of lean management accounting:

1. An example of eliminating transactions is the backflushing* of materials and costs in a  production process. Under a lean approach, instead of reporting the movement of raw material and of labor hit against a production job as it is made, all these transactions can be created when the product is completed on the shop floor.

2. Instead of using an Material Requirement Planning(MRP) or other shop-floor planning and scheduling system, replete with production work orders and shop-floor tracking systems to drive and control production, a lean manufacturer uses visual methods like kanbans. Company's Performance: Current Management Accounting Practice

1. Produce financial statements that are unnecessarily complex and confusing - and are obstacles to critical decision-making, not the actionable tools that they were intended to be.

2. Reward the wrong behaviour, such as excess inventory and long lead times, masking real improvement with distortions and false negatives that can derail a solid Lean initiative. Improvement through lean management accounting: Standard accounting measures can slow down or block dramatic Lean improvement. Lean Management Accounting offers alternatives and solutions that will put your accounting on track with your Lean journey. (Explained in the table given below)

2. Any delay, wait time, inspection, correction, auditing, and so forth are regarded as waste. Lean management accounting goes to great lengths to expose this waste so it can be eliminated.

3. A lean accounting system for cost and budgeting is focused on value streams, requires very few transactions, is based upon an understanding of the activities required to complete the job (production, marketing, design, service, or support operation), and the costs associated with those activities.

4. Because the accounting system is focused on the value stream it can also facilitate continuous improvement. Continuous improvement is vital to lean enterprise thinking. Purposes of Lean Management Accounting: To provide the value stream leader with performance measurement and cost information that can be effectively used to control and continuously improve the value stream. To provide information for performance measurement and cost reporting to senior people within the organization. To provide relevant cost information that can be used to post to the general ledger and the P&L report.  Measure Behavior Results Purchase- price variance Negotiate price based on Excess inventory & costs; best quantity discounts supplier may be overlooked. Machine utilization Machines run excess product Excess inventory; wrong inventory to maximize utilization ratio Setup time built into Encourages high run Excess inventory standard cost quantities Scrap factors built into No action if no variance Inflated standard; scrap allowed standard cost to exist Standard cost overhead Overproduce to avoid Excess inventory; wrong assumption unfavourable variance inventory Direct/indirect labor ratio Encourages inaccurate Total costs not in control; lack of labor reporting integrity  Advantages of lean management accounting:

1. Many companies introduce kanban production control but their accounting systems continue to require the tracking of financial information through production work orders and other documents. Lean management accounting eliminates these requirements so that the accounting systems reflect the simplification and waste reduction efforts required in a lean environment.

Conclusion:
In India, traditional monitoring system like 'Parta' has given lot of success to the Marwari organizations. Lean Management Accounting can very well match the requirement of these organizations and other organizations too. By implementing the Lean Management Accounting methods, managements can be assured that lean will become more than an initiative.  It will be a way of managing the enterprise for growth and profitability.
