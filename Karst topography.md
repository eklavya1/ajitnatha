# The conditions, which are necessary for the development of typical karst topography, include the following:

-   Relatively thick massive soluble rock, i.e., limestone, dolomite, or chalk near the surface.
-   Marked development of joints. If the rock is bedded, the beds should be thin.
-   Considerable relief (preferably several hundred meters) so that water is capable of circulation to cause typical karst topography.
-   Moderate to heavy rainfall to cause solution of rocks. Rainfall becomes carbonate by absorbing atmospheric CO2. Moreover, rainfall encourages growth of plants whose decomposition is an additional source of CO2 to the flowing water. In dry areas the development of karst landscape is inhibited.

In India, Karst topography is observed in parts of Himalayas, Chhattisgarh basin and coastal areas. Yana is a village located in forests of the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, India which is known for the development of karst topography.
