- A **caravanserai** (or caravansary; ) was a roadside inn where travelers (caravaners) could rest and recover from the day's journey. Caravanserais supported the flow of [[commerce]], information and people across the network of trade routes covering Asia, North Africa and Southeast Europe, most notably the [[Silk Road]]. Although many were located along rural roads in the countryside, urban versions of caravanserais were also historically common in cities throughout the Islamic world, though they were often called by other names such as khan, wikala, or funduq.
