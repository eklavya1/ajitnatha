the manzanares (spanish pronunciation: [manθaˈnaɾes]) is a river in the centre of the iberian peninsula, which flows from the sierra de guadarrama, passes through madrid, and eventually empties into the jarama river, which in turn is a right-bank tributary to the tagus.

in its urban section, the manzanares river was modified to create a section of water several meters deep, in some parts navigable by canoes. this project of channeling and damming has been partially reversed in a re-naturalization project.
