values are nothing but guiding principles, etc

source - external source or social system 
why do we tend to follow them - because society says it & is right thing to do

source - internal or individual 
why do we tend to follow them - because we believe in something being right or wrong say

objective/subjective/flexibility - these are more subjective as it varies from individual to individual 

## norms
norms: (1:40 pm)

one of sources of ethics is norms 
norms are social expectations that guide our behaviours 
it's set of rules or behaviour agreed upon by societal members & is binding on all 
norms are a form of social control on individuals to ensure conformity, to induce uniformity & check deviant behaviour

what is right thing to do
there are diff sources to answer this 
hence fulfilling need of having a common enforceable standard of behaviour led to codification of norms ie laws

## laws & ethics
laws & ethics: (1:54 pm)

laws are based on ethical framework & aim to bring social order while controlling unethical behaviour of individuals in society 
laws act as external standard & rules imposed on individuals by govt 
any individual disobeying laws is liable to face prescribed penalties & punishment. hence, deter non-compliance 
laws have societal sanctions & have important role in smooth functioning of society 
ethics act as moral compass in guiding individual when even law is silent on action 
ethics act as 1st line of defence against any wrong practices whereas law enforcement is remedial & reactive 
for ex:
role of administrator where discretion has to be exercised
a govt may not frame laws to dictate whether a company should make its products environmentally safe but doing so is ethical thing to do

exs: 

legal but unethical - breaking promises, live-in-relationships, denying ration under pds due to lack of aadhar might be legal but when it leads to death due to starvation is unethical; suicide; prostitution is legal in some countries but not ethical; passive euthanasia; inter-caste marriage, etc 
ethical but not legal - hungry child stealing a loaf of bread; it's ethical for a doctor to save unborn child but it's illegal to operate without consent; robinhood concept, etc
