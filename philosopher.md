- a philosopher is someone who practices philosophy.  the term philosopher comes from the ancient greek: φιλόσοφος, romanized: philosophos, meaning 'lover of wisdom'. the coining of the term has been attributed to the greek thinker pythagoras (6th century bce).in the classical sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing upon resolving existential questions about the human condition; it was not necessary that they discoursed upon theories or commented upon authors. those who most arduously committed themselves to this lifestyle would have been considered philosophers, and they typically followed a hellenistic philosophy.

- in a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who contributes to one or more branches of philosophy, such as aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, philosophy of science, logic, metaphysics, social theory, philosophy of religion, and political philosophy. a philosopher may also be someone who has worked in the humanities or other sciences which over the centuries have split from philosophy, such as the arts, history, economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, theology, and politics.
