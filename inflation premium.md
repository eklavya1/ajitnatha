The bonus brought by the inflation to tie borrowers is known as the inflation premium.
The interest bank charge on lending is known as the nominal interest rate, which might not be the real cost of borrowing paid by the borrower to the banks-
To calculate the real cost a borrower is paying on its loan, the nominal rate of interest is adjusted with the effect of inflation and thus the interest we get is known as the real interest rate-
The real interest rate always lowers the nominal interest rate if the inflation is taking place- the difference is the inflation premium.
