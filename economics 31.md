note - interest rates in our country are regulated i.e. rbi does not dictate what interest rate should bank offer to its depositors or charge from borrowers.
## external benchmarking
[[external benchmarking]]
- external benchmarking refers to process under which banks are required to use certain external interest rates as their variable costs.
- term ‘external’ means outside banks.
- rbi came up with list of some external benchmarks such as [[repo rate]], mibor (mumbai interbank offered rate); it's [[call rate]]; (call rate is rate at which banks lend money to each other), yield on 10 years [[government]] security, etc.
- by using these external benchmarks, mclral is sought to be made more sensitive to policy rate & therefore transmission can be improved.

## unconventional tools of monetary policy
[9:45 am]

### quantitative easing
- [[quantitative easing]] qe
- QE is bond buying program of american federal reserve under which it increased [[money supply]] in american [[economy]] exponentially through [[open market operations]].
- this was done so that banks would get [[money]] & lend this to individuals & other riskier entities.
- post-[[2008]] financial crisis, there was complete lack of trust in financial system & banks were reluctant to lend any money to anyone.
- they would invest all their money in [[government bond]]s or highly secure corporate bonds.
- to nudge banks into lending money, [[federal reserve]] purchased almost all government & secured corporate bonds from banks & thereby leaving them with cash so that this could be lent to [[economy]].
- federal reserve had target of 2% [[inflation]] which would be objective sign of [[demand]] returning to [[economy]].
- this was target used to measure success of QE & signal that went QE had to be reduced.
- fed would then taper bond buying accordingly.

### market sterilization scheme
- [[market sterilization scheme]] mss
- [11:12 am]
- policies such as quantitative easing result in too much foreign money being poured into indian economy.
- this causes unanticipated increase in money supply. for example- a, foreign investor brings 10 billion dollars to india. to use them he would have to convert them into rupees at bank branch.
- bank gives rupees & takes dollars. bank has little use of this dollar & thus takes them to [[rbi]] & exchanges these dollars for rupees. this causes increase in [[money supply]].
- to absorb this excess money supply created out of inflow of [[dollar]]s rbi sells special bonds c/a mss bonds on behalf of government in economy to sterilize or absorb this excess money.

## banking
