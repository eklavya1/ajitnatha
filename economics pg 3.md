## Land consolidation
(13:10)
Advantages of land consolidation: 
Reduced wastage of resources.
Better management of land resources.
Enhanced usage, economies of scale are possible.
Incentives to increase production.
Most of the states did not bring any consolidation.
Two states Punjab and Haryana made consolidation compulsory.
Land Consolidation: 
Amalgamation and redistribution of land with a view to bringing together all plots of land of a cultivator in one compact block.
After independence, almost all states except Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Manipur, Nagaland, and Tripura enacted laws for the consolidation of holdings.
While Punjab and Haryana made it compulsory, other states provided for consolidation on a voluntary basis.
It majority of the landowners agreed.

## Challenges to land consolidation
(13:24)
Ascertaining the quality of land was difficult.
Sentiments of people attached to their land.
Land records were not kept properly.
Lack of training and motivation of local bureaucracy.
Corruption in redistribution, the powerful got the fertile land, poor and marginalized got inferior land.
Inheritance, i.e. when the land will pass to the next generation, the fragmentation will happen.

## Cooperative farming
(13:36)
Farmers coming together and making cooperatives.
A more formal approach is the Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO). 

## Benefits of cooperative farming
(13:45)
Access to farming credit.
Cooperatives can buy larger / costly machines, and farmers can take it on rent.
Bulk purchase of fertilizers, etc. will save the cost.
Government support programs, extension services, subsidized fertilizers can be utilized by the cooperatives.
Knowledge, extension services of the government will be provided.
At farmers’ level: 
Sharing best practices among each other.
Higher risk-taking capacity, newer technology, etc.
If they pool land: Economies of scale are possible.
Better management of land, etc.
At output levels:
Aggregated production.
Logistics and easy transport.
Access to storage facilities.
Better bargain: Higher price negotiation.

## Why farmers’ cooperatives failed?
(14:07)
Lack of motivation for small farmers.
Cheating by large farmers in the cooperatives.
Lack of management, etc.: e.g. distribution of machinery, credit, etc.
Lack of leadership: e.g. absence of government leadership, official support, etc.

## Land Reforms
(14:43)
Problems in the land market: 
The state is not given conclusive land titles.
Lack of digitalization, etc.
Hence, the State will focus on solving this issue.
Corruption, false information, etc. are the issue.
Counterfeiting issues.

## Digitalization of land records

Digitalization of registry system.
Land Acquisition Resettlement and Rehabilitation Act 2013.
A lot of states are now giving ‘conclusive land titles’.
NITI Aayoga has come out with a model on conclusive title issues.
Madhya Pradesh is at the forefront of land digitalization.

## Need for modernization of Land Records
(14:55)
Land records in India are old, insufficient, and not duly updated.
The manual system of record-keeping is opaque, susceptible to manipulation, and hard to administer.
Presumptive land titles: In the present system of registration of deeds and documents as provided in the Registration Act, the titles to property are merely presumptive, and the state does not guarantee such titles.
Land records in India are maintained in different departments such as the survey department, which has the cadastral map, the registry department, and the revenue department. 
There is no coordination among the three.
This system has created huge inefficiencies in the land market, burdened the courts, and caused huge conflicts on land titles. 
This creates a lot of problems, such as issues in land and industry, provision of credit.

## Conclusive titling
(15:06)
It is based on four principles: 
A single agency to handle all land records.
The mirror principle states that at any given moment, the land records mirror the ground reality.
The curtain principle: Which refers to the fact that the record of title is a true depiction of ownership status.
The mutation is automatic following the registration and there is no need for probing into past title transactions as the title is the conclusive proof of ownership.
Title insurance: This refers to the fact that the title is guaranteed for its correctness and the party concerned is indemnified against any loss arising out of inaccuracy in this regard.

## Features of Digital India modernization
(15:23)
Computerization of land records, all textual data, including the record of rights, mutation data, and other land attributes data.
The survey, resurvey, and updating of the settlement records using modern technology options.
Computerization of registration.
Modern record rooms and land records management centers at the Tehsil levels.
Core GIS village index-based map. Which will integrate three layers of data, spatial data from satellite imagery, the survey of India and Forest Survey maps, and cadastral maps from the revenue department.
Legal changes: 
This includes amendments to the Registration Act, state Stamp Acts, and law for conclusive titling.
Recently under the Digital India land record modernization program, a feature of a unique land parcel number and national generic document registration system has been introduced.

## Why do we have a central law on land acquisition?

Because land acquisition is a Concurrent List subject.
For example, Farm Laws, Land Acquisition Act 1984, etc.

## Issues related to land acquisition

Vague purpose, the public purpose was not defined.
This law was very outdated, many elements of the British era.
The compensation was very low.
Delays in awarding compensation.
A poor mechanism or complete absence of rehabilitation and resettlement.
Private projects are being started. E.g. Vedanta land-related issue, Narmada Bachao issue.

The topic for the next class: Green Revolution, subsidies, etc.
