critical evaluation of india- asean partnership (1.11 pm)

same vibrancy is not there.
economic engagement is also not up to mark. economic engagements with china, usa is much more.
despite all good things, india’s relations with asean are not without challenges.
dictation (1.20 pm)
at present, there is a sense of disillusionment on both sides about present state of relationship-
though modi govts act east policy is aimed at enhancing india’s strategic profile in south east asia, new delhi continues to primarily focus on south asia & indian ocean region.
despite shift from saarc towards bimstec, india’s foreign policy priority continues to be south asia.
india’s regional economic profile is no match to china’s economic penetration of region.
india’s exports remain weak & it's opting out of rcep will further weaken its economic presence compared to other trade partners of asean.
india’s interest in asean as a multi-lateral regional forum is lack lusture. india continues to prioritize bilateral relations such as those with indonesia, myanmar over relations with entire grouping.
india seeks membership of or enters into partnership with regional organizations /c it's a global power credential even when its substantive engagements with such platforms remain weak.
apart from economic dimension, india’s act east policy has a strategic dimension as well- india, varying of china has become 1 of primary articulators of indo pacific vision.
however, asean countries are not entirely comfortable with this idea given their dependency on china.

steps taken by govt (1.33 pm)
steps taken by govt (1.33 pm)
india along with japan & usa are stepping up efforts to reduce asean countries' dependence on china primarily or infrastructure.

way forward (1.37 pm)
enhance economic & trade engagements.
focus on timely completion of projects.
bay of bengal can be used as an exploratory domain to develop india asean maritime relations.
strengthen cultural connect- offer more asean students scholarships into nalanda university & other premier institutions such as iits; iims
