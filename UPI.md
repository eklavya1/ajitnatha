the upi facility will soon be extended to feature phone users. at the moment, the unified payments interface (upi) — the single largest retail payments system in the country in terms of volume of transactions for small-value payments — is available only for smartphones.
unified payments interface (upi) is an instant real-time payment system, allowing users to transfer money on a real-time basis, across multiple bank accounts without revealing details of one's bank account to the other party.
the idea of upi was developed by the national payments corporation of india (npci) and is controlled by the reserve bank of india (rbi) and iba (indian bank association).
upi is currently the biggest among the national payments corporation of india (npci) operated systems including national automated clearing house (nach), immediate payment service (imps), aadhaar enabled payment system (aeps), bharat bill payment system (bbps), rupay etc.
the top upi apps include phonepe, paytm, google pay, amazon pay and bhim, the latter being the govemment offering.
