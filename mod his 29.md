# evaluation of goi act, 1935
- æ™‚ - `01:46 PM 29/7/2021`
- labour party in [[britain]] (was in opposition) parliament
- they said -"goi act only protects the british interests by sharing power with loyalist sections"
- no responsible government at the centre
- right to vote limited to 10% of the [[population]]
- no mention of dominion status 01:48 PM 29/7/2021, since 1928, [[nehru report]], demand of dominion past 1929, [[lahore sesion]] of [[poorna swaraj]]
- irwin statement - also called as `diwali declaration`,  oct 1929
- inc shuo - "only real change is transfer of powers from secretary of state to viceroy" 01:51 PM 29/7/2021
- british goal was to provincialize the inc
- goi act [[1935]] brought provincial autonomy & fully responsible government @ provincial level 01:55 PM 29/7/2021
- [[british]] expected that [[indian national congress]] leaders would get busy in running the govt at state level
- also with [[government]] formation @ provincial level, the regional leaders of inc will emerge as autonomous power centres from central leadership of inc which would weaken all india leadership of inc
- with [[dyarchy]], [[british]] would control centre firmly 01:59 PM 29/7/2021
- why provisions related to centre never implemented
- [[muslim league]] felt that centre provided for goi act 1935 was still more powerful than the provinces, ie they felt the goi act 1935 provided for unitary features, this was because only a few provinces were muslim majority provinces & therefore the indirect elections in federal assembly would lead to domination of inc in federal assembly, therefore they wanted a weaker centre (ie legislature & executive) 02:05 PM 29/7/2021
# princely states
- æ™‚ - `02:07 PM 29/7/2021`
- goi act 1935 provided for federal relations, this was in line with [[nehru report]]
- between [[princely states]] & british india (IE PRINCELY STATES WOULD HAVE MORE POWERS THAN STATES OF BRITISH INDIA) 02:08 PM 29/7/2021
- however the princely states still feared loss of autonomy ex - financial autonomy, if they acede to union of india
- becoming part of uoi would provide more access of princely states to inc leaders which may encourage people of princely states to demand democratic reforms, thereby threatening the status of princes 02:13 PM 29/7/2021
- ![[Pasted image 20210729142306.png]] 02:23 PM 29/7/2021
- [[indian national congress]] (30-40%) seats at centre legislative bodies were reserved "nominees" of princely [[state]] (ie not elected by the people) therefore inc could never have majority in central legislature 
- inc demanded that instead of nominees of princes there should be elected representatives from princey states
- inc demanded constituent assembly elected by universal adult franchise 02:30 PM 29/7/2021
- ![[Pasted image 20210729143912.png]] 02:39 PM 29/7/2021
# india & WWII
- æ™‚ - `02:40 PM 29/7/2021`
- ![[Pasted image 20210729144401.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20210729145105.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20210729150250.png]] 03:02 PM 29/7/2021
- [[gandhi]] was a bit egoist 03:08 PM 29/7/2021
- from [[quit india movement]] [[1942]], until end of wwr most inc leadrs were in jail
- brits
	- made [[august offer]] [[1940]]
	- cripps mission 1942
	- these were 2 efforts by brits to get indian support in ww2
- [[muslim league]]
	- saw an opportunity that  brits are willing to seek a solution to get indian support for war, muslim league gave [[pakistan]] resolution (mar 1940) & supported british in wwr for securing maximum benefits in any dispensation, post ww2 [[world war 2|second world war]]
- inc
	- was ready to support brits in ww2
	- brits do immediate transfer of power at centre (goi act [[1919]], operational at centre)
	- and promise to setup a constituent assembly post ww2, which will draft a [[constitution]] for independent united [[india]]
	- via [[cr formula]] 1944 & desai liaqat pact 1945, [[indian national congress]] tried to get support of muslim league for a united [[india]] but it failed 03:21 PM 29/7/2021
# august offer by brits
- æ™‚ - `03:22 PM 29/7/2021`
- context - [[adolf hitler]] seemed unstoppable
- ![[august offer]]
- ww2 [[indian national congress]] demands
	- immediate transfer of power via a responsible government @ the centre
			- meaning - [[viceroy]] = just a constitutional head & real [[power]] with elected head
			- executive is responsible to [[parliament]] (populated via elections) 03:26 PM 29/7/2021
			- promise that there will be a [[constituent assembly]] post ww2
			- [[britain]] should declare [[war]] aims ie what do they wanna achieve by winning this [[war]] ie what they will do after winningðŸ¥‡
			- didnt want to promise anything to indians therefore did not declare war aims 03:36 PM 29/7/2021
- [[lord linlithgow]] 3643 [[1936]]-43, rejected all demands & only said that he will setup an advisory committee of poiticians from british india & representatives of princes--> lead to --> [[congress working committee]] meet in [[wardha]] [[1939]] inc decided to support in war effort
- gave a call to withdraw from the PLA
- [[lord linlithgow]] panicked & stated that after ww2, india wil get dominion status
- march [[1940]] - jinnah gave [[pakistan resolution]] 03:47 PM 29/7/2021
	- here [[pakistan]] or [[lahore resolution]]  meant group of [[muslim]] majority states within the union of india, where centre is very weak & all powers are at state level
# august offer 1940
- æ™‚ - `03:53 PM 29/7/2021`
- [[august offer]]
- will expand [[viceroy]]'s executive council to have more indians
- will setup an advisory war council to incorporate use of indians in war effort (ww2) (to incorporate indian views in war effort)
- veto was given to [[muslim league]] wrt constitution framing post ww2 (03:55 PM 29/7/2021) post ww2, ie no [[future]] constitution without the consent of minorities
- will setup constituent assembly having `mainly indians` after ww2 (simon [[commission]] 1927-29 had no indians)
- brits recognized right of indians to draft their own constitution
- british explicitly promised dominion status (irwin statement oct [[1929]] [[montagu statement 1917]] implied dominion status to india + [[nehru report]] 1928) 04:01 PM 29/7/2021
- rejected by [[indian national congress]] @ [[wardha session]] because it laid down foundations of [[partition]] of india 04:05 PM 29/7/2021 (no [[future]] constitution without consent of minority ie veto to muslim league.......upar wala point)
- inc said demand since 1929 [[lahore session]] is purna [[swaraj]] and not just dominion
- mohammad ali jinnah ([[muslim league]]) rejected because [[august offer]] did not have any mention of [[pakistan]] or 2 constituent assemblies 04:08 PM 29/7/2021
- [[gandhi]] under [[pressure]] to launch a [[civil disobedience movement]] found middle path by launching [[individual satyagraha]], where individual satyagrahis would make a demand of freedom of speech and expression & court arrest
- [[vinoba bhave]], [[jawaharlal nehru]] & [[brahmadutt]] = first 3 individual satyagrahis  #pre 
- this led to --> dilli chalo movement ie individual satyagrahis would start marching to [[delhi]] if encountered by police would make demand of free speech, therefore it became `jail bharo andolan` 04:15 PM 29/7/2021
- 1941 - [[viceroy]]'s executive council expanded from 3/8 indians to 8/12 indians, but defence, home & finance not to indian ministers 04:18 PM 29/7/2021
