The 4th round of UDAN was launched in December 2019 with a special focus on North-Eastern Regions, Hilly States, and Islands.
The airports that had already been developed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) are given higher priority for the award of VGF (Viability Gap Funding) under the Scheme.
Under UDAN 4, the operation of helicopters and seaplanes is also been incorporated.
UDAN Scheme (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) is aimed at enhancing connectivity to remote and regional areas of the country and making air travel affordable.
