occurs in warm, dry, & sunny climates by action of sunlight on unsaturated hydrocarbons & oxides of [[nitrogen]].
aka "los angeles smog".
occurs most prominently in urban areas that have large nos of automobiles (nitrogen oxides are primary emissions).
photochemical (summer smog) forms when pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (primary pollutant) & organic compounds (primary pollutants) react together in +ce of sunlight.
gas c/a ozone (secondary pollutant) is formed.
nitrogen dioxide + sunlight + hydrocarbons = ozone (O3 in stratosphere is beneficial, but near earth's surface it results in global warming as it's a greenhouse gas)
resulting smog causes a light brownish coloration of atmosphere, reduced visibility, plant damage, irritation of eyes, & respiratory distress.
peroxyacyl nitrates (also k/a acyl peroxy nitrates, apn, or pans) are powerful respiratory & eye irritants present in photochem smog. 
they are lachrymators, causing eye irritation at concentrations of only a few parts/billion. at higher concentrations, they cause extensive damage to vegetation.
