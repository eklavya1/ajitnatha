Civil Disobedience Movement, considered as second major Gandhian mass movement, popularly labelled as Salt Satyagraha, made a distinct advance in broadening social reach of anti-imperialist struggle compared to Non-cooperation Movement, launched during early [[1920]]s.
**There are certain aspects in which Civil Disobedience movement differed from Non-Cooperation movement -**
stated objective during Civil Disobedience movement was complete independence.
methods involved violation of law from very beginning  & just non-cooperation with foreign rule.
During Civil Disobedience movement, there was a decline in forms of protests involving intelligentsia, such as lawyers giving up practice, students giving up govemment schools to join national schools  & colleges.
Muslim participation was nowhere near that in Non-Cooperation movement level.
No major labour upsurge coincided with Civil Disobedience Movement.
massive participation of peasants  & business groups in Civil Disobedience movement compensated for decline of other features.

In many ways, civil disobedience movement is credited for paving way for freedom in India.
It was significant in many ways as it was a movement that spread to urban areas  & witnessed participation of women  & people belonging to lower castes.
It was initiated under stewardship of Mahatma Gandhi.
It was launched after observance of Independence Day in [[1930]].
civil disobedience movement commenced with infamous dandi march when Gandhi left Sabarmati Ashram at Ahmedabad on foot with 78 other members of Ashram for Dandi on 12 March 1930. After reaching Dandi, Gandhi broke salt law.
It was considered illegal to make salt as it was solely a government monopoly.
salt satyagraha led to a widespread acceptance of civil Disobedience movement across country.
This event became symbolic of people's defiance of govemment policies.
Following Gandhi's footsteps, C. Rajgopalchari in Tamil Nadu led a similar march from Trichinopoly to Vedaranyam. At same time Sarojini Naidu, a prominent leader in congress led movement in Darasana in Gujarat.
police opened a lathi charge which led to over 300 satyagrahis being severely injured.
Consequently, there were demonstrations, hartals, a boycott of foreign goods,  & later refusal to pay taxes.
A lakh of participants including women participated in this movement.
Large scale participation of women was an important feature of Civil Disobedience Movement.
During Salt March, thousands of women came out of their homes to listen to speeches of Gandhi.
Women participated in protest marches, manufactured salt,  & picketed foreign cloth  & liquor shops. Many went to jail.
