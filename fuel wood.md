[[india]] is largest producer of fuelwood in [[world]].

Firewood is any wooden material that is gathered & used for fuel.  Generally, firewood is not highly processed & is in some sort of recognizable log or branch form, compared to other forms of wood fuel like pellets or chips. Firewood can be seasoned & heat treated (dry) or unseasoned (fresh/wet). It is generally classified as hardwood or softwood.

Firewood is a renewable resource. However, demand for this fuel can outpace its ability to regenerate on a local or regional level. Good forestry practices & improvements in devices that use firewood can improve local wood supplies.

Moving firewood long distances can potentially transport diseases & invasive species.
