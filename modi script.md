Modi (Marathi: मोडी, 𑘦𑘻𑘚𑘲‎ Mōḍī, Marathi pronunciation: [moːɖiː]; also Mudiya) is a script used to write the Marathi language, which is the primary language spoken in the state of Maharashtra, India. There are multiple theories concerning its origin. The Modi script was used alongside the Devanagari script to write Marathi until the 20th century when the Balbodh style of the Devanagari script was promoted as the standard writing system for Marathi.
