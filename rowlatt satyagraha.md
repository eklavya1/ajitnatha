The non-cooperation movement was a political campaign launched in [[1920]], by Mahatma Gandhi to have Indians revoke their cooperation from the British government, with the aim of inducing the British to grant self-governance.This came as result of the Indian National Congress (INC) withdrawing its support for British reforms following the Rowlatt Act of 18 March [[1919]]—which suspended the rights of political prisoners in sedition trials, and was seen as a "political awakening" by Indians and as a "threat" by the British—and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 13 April 1919.The movement was one of Gandhi’s first organized acts of large-scale satyagraha (civil disobedience). Gandhi's planning of the non-cooperation movement included persuading all Indians to withdraw their labour from any activity that "sustained the British government and also economy in India," including British industries and educational institutions. Through non-violent means, or Ahinsa, protesters would refuse to buy British goods, adopt the use of local handicrafts, and picket liquor shops. In addition to promoting "self-reliance" by spinning khadi, buying Indian-made goods only, and boycotting British goods, Gandhi's non-cooperation movement called for the restoration of the Khilafat (Khilafat movement) in Turkey and the end to untouchability. This resulted in publicly-held meetings and strikes (hartals), which led to the first arrests of both Nehru and his father, Motilal Nehru, on 6 December 1921.The non-cooperation movement was among the broader movement for Indian independence from British rule and ended, as Nehru described in his autobiography, "suddenly" on 4 February 1922 after the Chauri Chaura incident. Subsequent independence movements were the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement.Though intended to be non-violent, the movement was eventually called off by Gandhi in February [[1922]] following the Chauri Chaura incident, in which numerous policemen were murdered by a mob at Chauri Chaura, United Provinces. Nonetheless, the movement marked the transition of Indian nationalism from a middle-class basis to the masses.
