in 1911, while studying properties of matter at very low temperatures, dutch physicist heike
kamerlingh onnes& his team discovered that electrical resistance of mercury goes to zero below 4.2 k
(-2690c).
o this was very 1st observation of phenomenon of superconductivity.
majority of chemical elements become superconducting at sufficiently low temperatures.
below a certain "critical" temperature, materials undergo a transition into superconducting state, characterized by 2 basic properties:
firstly, they offer no resistance to passage of electrical current.
when resistance falls to zero, a current can circulate inside material without any dissipation of energy.
o secondly, provided they are sufficiently weak, external magnetic fields will not penetrate superconductor but remain at its surface.
this field expulsion phenomenon is k/a meissner effect, after physicist who 1st observed it in 1933.
## what
it's a state in which a material shows absolutely zero electrical resistance.
while resistance is a property that restricts flow of electricity, superconductivity allows unhindered flow.
in a superconducting state, material offers no resistance at all.
all electrons align themselves in a particular direction& move without any obstruction in a "coherent" manner.
 b/c of zero resistance, superconducting materials can save huge amounts of energy,& be used to make
highly efficient electrical appliances.

type - i Superconductors
1. The material loses magnetization suddenly.
2. They exhibit a complete Meissner effect,i.e. they are completely diamagnetic.
3. There is only one critical magnetic field
4. No mixed state exists.

Type - ii Superconductors
1. Material loses magnetization gradually.
2. They do not exhibit the Meissner effect.
3. There are two critical magnetic fields,i.e. lower critical field and upper critical fields.
4. A mixed state is present.
