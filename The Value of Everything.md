# The Value of Everything

We often hear businesses, entrepreneurs or sectors talking about themselves as ‘wealth-creating’. The contexts may differ – finance, big pharma or small start-ups – but the self-descriptions are similar: I am a particularly productive member of the economy, my activities create wealth, I take big ‘risks’, and so I deserve a higher income than people who simply benefit from the spillovers of this activity. But what if, in the end, these descriptions are simply just stories? Narratives created in order to justify inequalities of wealth and income, massively rewarding the few who are able to convince governments and [[society]] that they deserve high rewards, while the rest of us make do with the leftovers. — location: [47]()

The [[Greek]] philosopher Plato once argued that storytellers rule the world. His great work The Republic is in part a guide to educating the leader of his ideal state, the Guardian. [[Plato]] recognized that stories form character, [[culture]] and behaviour: ‘Our first business is to supervise the [[production]] of stories, and chose only those we think suitable, and reject the rest. — location: [151]()

This is not an abstract debate. It has far-reaching consequences – social and political as well as economic – for everyone. How we discuss [[value]] affects the way all of us, from giant corporations to the most modest shopper, behave as actors in the economy and in turn feeds back into the economy, and how we measure its performance. This is what philosophers call ‘performativity’: — location: [191]()

It is crucial to remember that all types of accounting methods are evolving social [[conventions]], defined not by physical laws and definite ‘realities’ but reflecting the ideas, theories and ideologies of the age in which they are devised.1 The way in which a spreadsheet is constructed in itself reflects values. An interesting example is the Jesuit Order. Back in the 1500s, the newly founded Order devised an innovative accounting system which blended vision with finance. In order to align finance with the values of their order, they made sure that the cash box could only be opened with two keys: one operated by the person in charge of the finances (the procurator, today’s CFO) and another by the person in charge of the strategy (the rector, today’s CEO). — location: [1840]()

Keynes’s book How to Pay for the [[War]], published in 1940, introduced the idea of recording national income in a set of accounts and completely changed the way in which governments used that [[data]]. In the late 1930s — location: [1980]()

When government stops investing in its own capacity, it becomes more unsure of itself, less able, and the probability of failure increases. It becomes harder to justify the existence of a particular government function, leading to further cuts or eventually to privatization. — location: [5803]()

Government has often been at its best when mission- oriented – precisely because, as [[President]] Kennedy said, it is hard. Doing ‘hard’ things means being willing to explore, experiment, make mistakes and to learn from those mistakes. But this is almost impossible in a context in which government ‘failure’ is deemed the worst of all sins, and in which the guns are loaded, waiting for government to make the slightest mistake. — location: [5824]()

Business investment is mainly driven by perceptions of [[future]] opportunities, whether these be in a new sector (the emergence of nanotechnology), or in a region that is perceived as an exciting place for new ideas. As we have seen, such opportunities have historically been funded directly by governments, whether by DARPA-type investments in what later became the [[internet]], or the Danish government’s investment in renewable [[energy]]. — location: [5839]()
