Right to assemble peacefully and without arms: Every citizen has the right to assemble peacefully and without arms.
o It includes the right to hold public meetings, demonstrations and take out processions.
This freedom can be exercised only on public land and the Assembly must be peaceful and unarmed.
This provision does not protect violent, disorderly, riotous assemblies or any that causes breach of public peace or one that involves arms.
This right does not include the right to strike.
The word 'strike' means a cessation of work or a concerted refusal to work based on common understating by the employees of any industry to get their demands fulfilled.
o Today, almost all nations whether socialist, democratic or capitalistic, provide the right to strike to their workers.
o It is to be used as a weapon of last resort.
The right to strike is not a fundamental right in India.
o It was only after the enactment of the Industrial Disputes Act in 1947 that the right to strike was recognized in India as a statutory right.
o Section 22(1 )(a) of the Act states that employees can go for a strike in case of breach of contract provided prior notice is given to the employer within 6 weeks of such strike.
o It is therefore a legal and statutory right.
