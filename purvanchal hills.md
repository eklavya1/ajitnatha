Eastern Hills or The Purvanchal are the southward extensions of the Himalayas running along the north-eastern edge of India.
At the Dihang gorge, the Himalayas take a sudden southward bend and form a series of comparatively low hills which are collectively called the Purvanchal.
They run along the India-Myanmar Border extending from Arunachal Pradesh in the north to Mizoram in the south
