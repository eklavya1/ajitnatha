- The tradition of painting extended further down south in [[tamil nadu]] in the preceding centuries with regional variations during the regimes of Pallava, Pandya and Chola dynasties. The Pallava kings who succeeded the Chalukya kings in parts of South India, were also patrons of arts. [[Mahendravarman I]] who ruled in the [[7th century]] was responsible for building temples at [[Panamalai]], [[Mandagapattu]] and [[kanchipuram]].

- The inscription at Mandagapattu mentions Mahendravarman I with numerous titles such as
	- Vichitrachitta (curious-minded),
	- Chitrakarapuli (tiger among artists),
	- Chaityakari (templebuilder), which show his interest in art activities.
	
- The paintings in these temples too were done at his initiative, though only fragments remain. The [[Panamalai]] figure of a female divinity is drawn gracefully. Paintings at the Kanchipuram temple were patronised by the Pallava king, [[Rajsimha]]. Only traces of paintings remain now which depict [[Somaskanda]]. Faces are round and large. Lines are rhythmic with increased ornamentation when compared with the paintings of an earlier periods. Depiction of torso still remains like the earlier sculptural tradition but is elongated.

- When the Pandyas came to power, they too patronised art. [[Tirumalaipuram]] caves and Jaina caves at [[Sittanvasal]] are some of the surviving examples. A few fragmented layers of paintings can be seen in [[Tirumalaipuram]]. In Sittanavasal, the paintings are visible on the ceilings of shrines, in verandas, and on the brackets.

- On the pillars of the veranda are seen dancing figures of _celestial nymphs_. The contours of figures are firmly drawn and painted in [[vermilion]] red on a lighter background. The body is rendered in yellow with subtle modelling. Supple limbs, expression on the faces of dancers, rhythm in their swaying movement, all speak of the artists’ skill in creative imagination in visualising the forms in the architectural context. Their eyes are slightly elongated and at times protrude off the face. This feature is observed in many subsequent paintings in the Deccan and [[South India]].

- The tradition of building temples and embellishing them with carvings and paintings continued during the reign of the Chola kings who ruled over the region from the [[9th century]] - [[13th century]]. But it was in the [[11th century]], when the Cholas reached their zenith of power, that masterpieces of the Chola art and architecture began to appear. The temples of [[Brihadeswara]] at [[tanjore 或 thanjavur]],[[Gangaikonda]] [[Cholapuram]] and [[Darasuram]] in Tamil Nadu were built during the reigns of [[Rajaraja Chola]], his son, [[Rajendra Chola]] and [[Raja raja Chola II]], respectively.

- Though Chola paintings are seen in Nartamalai, the most important are those in Brihadeswara temple. The paintings were executed on the walls of the narrow passage surrounding the shrine. Two layers of paintings were found when they were discovered. The upper layer was painted during the Nayak period, in the [[16th century]]. Thanks to the cleaning of the surface painting, examples of the great tradition of painting during the Chola period were unveiled.
- The paintings show narrations and aspects related to [[Lord Shiva]], Shiva in Kailash, Shiva as [[Tripurantaka]], Shiva as [[Nataraja]], a portrait of the patron Rajaraja and his mentor [[Kuruvar]], dancing figures, etc.
