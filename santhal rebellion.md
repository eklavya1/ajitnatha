continued oppression of santhals, an agricultural people, who had fled to settle in plains of rajmahal hills ([[bihar]]) led to santhal rebellion against zamindars.
money-lenders who had support of police among others had joined [[zamindar]]s to subject peasants to oppressive exactions & dispossession of lands.
rebellion turned into an anti-british movement.
under sidhu & kanhu, two brothers, santhals proclaimed an end to company rule & declared area between bhagalpur & rajmahal as autonomous.
rebellion was suppressed by [[1856]].
