Recap of the previous class discussion
(1:08 PM)

- Contractual worker lies between formal and informal. How long you perform and what you perform and for what money you perform all will be decided under the contract.
- The informal worker had good rights in theory but not in the practice.
- The contractual workers in a practical sense have better working conditions as compared to the informal worker.
- Fixed Term Employee: Only for a pre-defined term. He can join further for another term in the same firm. Coach of the Indian Cricket team, Governor of the RBI.
- Gig Worker: They are doing the jobs but not the hired worker of that client. Example of a teacher that can teach in Unacademy, BYJU, or on Youtube. Now we have recognized it on the platform worker such as Ola, Uber, Unacademy.
- Examples of the workers of the vision IAS for the contractual worker, formal, informal workers, fixed-term workers, and gig workers.
- Examples of different types of contracts such as contracts for the installation of the light in a firm, etc.
- Almost all the teachers in the Delhi University are contractual workers as they are teaching as per the contract with the Delhi University. One of the contracts could be that the teacher cannot teach outside the Delhi University.

## Contractualization of Labour Force
(1:33 PM)

- The Labour force is being transformed into the contractual worker. Broadly a firm could have two types of the worker. One is directly employed and the other that are indirectly employed.
- Traditionally the firms had mostly directly employed workers were more but over a period of time, the contractual workers have increased and directly employed workers have deceased.
- Firms find it difficult to oblige with labour law for the directly employed worker. In order to reduce the compliance burden, the firms refer to hiring the workers on a contractual basis.
- Wages of the contract worker grow at the least pace as compared to the other types of workers.

## Reasons For the Contractualization of the Workforce
- Contractualization of workers refers to more and more proportion of workers being comprised of contractual workers rather than directly hired workers.
- Contractualization is largely attributed to the higher cost of employing people directly.
- The main reason for the higher cost of directly employed workers is not wages or social security benefits that a firm has to provide to its workers rather it is the compliance burden on the firms.
- The multiplicity of labour laws and most of them being framed in the distant past make compliance difficult and many times inhibitive to the firm’s operation.

## Other Reasons for the contractualization are as follow

- Size of the firms
	- Most of the firms in our country are small (MSMEs). Small firms do not create jobs. And if there is a perverse incentive for the firms to remain small then adequate will not be generated. There are about 7.7 crore MSMEs (around 90% of total firms.), employing about 15 crore people (which is about half of the non-agricultural employment).
- As can be seen, MSMEs are not employment generators. They remain small because the compliance burden of tax, environmental and labour laws on the large firms is substantially greater than the small firms. Hence lack of employment generation, most of which is contractual.
- Subsidies are provided for capital augmentation which makes the relative cost of capital more affordable. Firms use an optimal mixed of labour and capital to produce.
- In case capital becomes relatively cheaper than before, either due to subsidies on capital or due to compliance burden because of labour, the firms may decide to replace labour with capital.
- This also becomes the reason for the lack of employment generation and keeping the workforce contractual as once the firm is able to afford capital then it finds it easy to remove contractual labour.
- Subsidiers on capital augmentation are required because of the increasing pace of change of technology and the requirement to remain internationally competitive. Such subsidies however distort the optimum mix of labour and capital and ∴ may cause a sub-optimal production level.
- This becomes a case where subsidies are required as well as have a detrimental effect. The solution is not to make capital expensive rather to reduce the compliance cost with respect to the labour.

## Steps for the creation of Employment
(2:25 PM)
- Focus on skilling and employability
- Reduce the burden of complying with labour laws by streamlining them and making compliance easy.
- Handholding of firms to enable them to grow big. The incentive for small firms can be there but with a [[sunset clause]]. That means it should be for a limited time.
- Supply-side measures for increasing economic growth: Actual improvement in ease of doing business.
- Focus on certain sectors which have a high potential for growth, export and employment. These are referred to as champion sectors for example food processing industry, leather and textiles, pharm, semi-conductor and allied sectors, etc. Through schemes such as production linked incentive scheme, this focused growth can be achieved faster.

## Some Basic Concept of the Economics
(2:41 PM)
- An economist attempts to answer the basic problem of limited resources and how should they be utilized to produce maximum output from them.
- The answer to the utilization of resources involves both political as well economic decisions. The political decisions are with respect to who decides how should the limited resources be used. The ethical decisions are with respect to what is the best way to utilize those resources and distributes the product amongst the claimants.
- The economic decision is with respect to given other constraints what is the most efficient utilization of resource. An economist is not concerned about the preference as they are unquantifiable. Only when they can be quantified such as by incorporating the value in terms of price, can an economist comment on the preferences and incorporate them in his/her decisions.

## Budget Constraint and Production Possibility Frontiers (PPF)
[[production possibility frontier]]
- Utilization of limited resources where wants are unlimited, the manner of utilization of resources should be such that maximum want of the people should be achieved.
- The fundamental problem in economics is the scarcity of resources.
- Budget constrain incorporates the idea that the resources are available in a limited quantity and there is an existing level of technology that can be used to utilize the limited resources. Given the existing technology of utilization, there is a limit as to what is the maximum that can be produced.
- This maximum possibility of production is represented graphically through a production possibilities curve (PPC) also called as Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF).
- Given above is the possible use of a 10 hours day of a person scenario a,b,c,d,e and f are all best possible use of this time. ∴ for an economist, all six scenarios are equally good as they represent the optimal utilization of the limited resource that is the time.
- It is plotted on the graph called PPF. Points outside the PPF is desirable but not possible. Thus the points at the PPF are desirable as well as possible. The PPF is a collection of those points which are both desirable and possible.
- Since PPF represent those points that are desirable and possible, it essentially becomes an economist idea as to where the PPF would be.
- Some economists may have a higher expectation about what is possible and ∴ will plot the PPF further away from another economist who things that possibilities are less.
- PPF is an idea representing that there is a certain maximum that can be produced and if less than that is produced, the current level becomes sub-optimal.
- Some economists’ ideas may be that PPF is higher and there is a big gap between current production and the possible output, while for another current production may be very close to the possible output. Current production is a fact, possible production is an idea.
- An economist will prefer to steer away from the preferences for production unless the preferences are quantified.
- [[marginal cost]]: It is the cost incurred in producing the extra unit of the product.
- [[opportunity cost]]: It is the benefit foregone when you choose one over another. _related_ [[zero-sum game]] | [[scarcity]] | [[abundance mindset]] 

The topic for the next class discussion: Marginal Cost, Opportunity Cost, and further other basics will be continued
