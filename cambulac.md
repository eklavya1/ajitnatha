- Khanbaliq or Dadu of Yuan (Chinese: 元大都) was the winter capital of the Yuan dynasty founded by Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing, also the capital of [[China]] today. It was located at the center of modern [[Beijing]]. The Secretariat (中書省) directly administered the Central Region (腹裏) of the Yuan Empire (comprising present-day Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and parts of Henan and Inner Mongolia) and dictated policies for the other provinces. Kublai and his successors also claimed supremacy over the entire Mongol Empire following the death of Möngke Khan (Kublai's brother and predecessor) in 1259. Over time the unified empire gradually fragmented into a number of khanates.
- Khanbaliq is the direct predecessor to modern Beijing, and sections of Line 10 and Line 13 have stations honoring the gates of Dadu.
