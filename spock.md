- Spock is a fictional character in the Star Trek media franchise. Originally played by Leonard Nimoy, Spock first appeared in the original Star Trek series serving aboard the starship USS Enterprise as science officer and first officer and later as commanding officer of two iterations of the vessel. Spock's mixed human-Vulcan heritage serves as an important plot element in many of the character's appearances. Along with Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), he is one of the three central characters in the original Star Trek series and its films. After retiring from active duty in Starfleet, Spock served as a Federation ambassador, and later became involved in the ill-fated attempt to save Romulus from a supernova, leading him to live out the rest of his life in a parallel timeline.

- Spock was played by Nimoy in the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, eight of the Star Trek feature films, and a two-part episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Multiple actors have played the character since Nimoy within Star Trek's main continuity; the most recent portrayal is Ethan Peck, who played Spock as a recurring character in the second season of Star Trek: Discovery and in Star Trek: Short Treks. Peck has reprised the role, this time as a main character, in the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, which acts as both a Discovery spin-off and a prequel to the original Star Trek series. Additionally, Zachary Quinto played an alternate reality version of Spock in the feature films Star Trek (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), and Star Trek Beyond (2016). Although the three films are set in the aforementioned parallel timeline, Nimoy appears in the first two as the original timeline's Spock.Aside from the series and films in the Star Trek franchise, Spock has also appeared in numerous novels, comics, and video games.
