- diminishing returns is an economic principle stating that decreasing in marginal (incremental) output of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is incrementally increased, holding all other factors of production equal (ceteris paribus). the law of diminishing returns (also known as the law of diminishing marginal productivity) states that in productive processes, increasing a factor of production by one unit, while holding all other production factors constant, will at some point return a lower unit of output per incremental unit of input. after the point of optimum production, excessively adding to the input variable will not only lead to a decrease in efficiency, but also to a negative return of production. a negative return might hurt the whole production process.the modern understanding of the law adds the dimension of holding other outputs equal, since a given process is understood to be able to produce co-products. an example would be a factory increasing its saleable product, but also increasing its co2 production, for the same input increase. the law of diminishing returns is a fundamental principle of both micro and macro economics and it plays a central role in production theory.the concept of diminishing returns can be explained by considering other theories such as the concept of exponential growth. it is commonly understood that growth will not continue to rise exponentially, rather it is subject to different forms of constraints such as limited availability of resources and capitalisation which can cause economic stagnation. this example of production holds true to this common understanding as production is subject to the four factors of production which are land, labour, capital and enterprise. these factors have the ability to influence economic growth and can eventually limit or inhibit continuous exponential growth. therefore, as a result of these constraints the production process will eventually reach a point of maximum yield on the production curve and this is where marginal output will stagnate and move towards zero. however it should also be considered that innovation in the form of technological advances or managerial progress can minimise or eliminate diminishing returns to restore productivity and efficiency, and to generate profit.



this idea can plays an important parts on the theory of rent and the theory of population and it should find it promulgated both by the reputed anticipator of ricardo, james anderson, and by malthus' essay on the principle of population. the population size on earth is growing rapidly, but this will not continue forever (exponentially). constraints such as resources will see the population growth stagnate at some point and begin to decline. similarly, it will begin to decline towards zero, but not actually become a negative value. the same idea as in the diminishing rate of return inevitable to the production process.
