- The Vellore mutiny on 10 July 1806 was the first instance of a large-scale and violent mutiny by Indian sepoys against the East India Company, predating the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by half a century. The revolt, which took place in the South Indian city of Vellore, lasted one full day, during which mutineers seized the Vellore Fort and killed or wounded 200 British troops.
• Vellore Mutiny erupted in the form of a violent strike at the Vellore Fort by the soldiers of the Madras regiment on 10th July 1806.
 • There were few reasons for the outbreak of the mutiny:
	 ◦ In 1805, General Sir John Craddock, who was the Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army, ordered a change in the army’s uniform that hurt the sentiments of both Hindu as well as Muslim soldiers.
	 ◦ Hindus were prohibited from putting religious marks on their forehead and Muslims were forced to trim their mustaches and beards.
	 ◦ In place of the turban they were used to wearing, they were asked to wear a round hat usually associated with Europeans.
	 ◦ [[tipu sultan]], who was the ruler of the Kingdom of [[mysore]] till he was defeated and killed by the British in 1799. After his death, his wives, children, and servants were confined to the city of Vellore. People were angry about the disrespect shown by the British to the erstwhile ruler’s sons. An attack was planned. This was the triggering point.
 • The course of events during the mutiny:
	 ◦ Soon after midnight, around 500 Indian soldiers broke into the Vellore fort and murdered more than 100 unsuspecting soldiers who were sleeping.
	 ◦ The rebels took down the Union Jack (the flag of the U.K.) and replaced it with the flag of Tipu Sultan. They then declared Tipu Sultan’s son as the king.
 • Consequences of the Mutiny:
	 ◦ The revolt was suppressed within a day. After a trial, the sepoys involved in mutiny were punished to death.
	 ◦ John Caddock the commander in chief and [[william bentinck]], the Governor of Madras, along with other senior British officers were sacked and recalled back to Britain.
	 ◦ The new dress regulations were abolished and Tipu Sultan’s family was moved to Calcutta.
