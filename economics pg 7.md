Regulation of Agricultural Marketing (9:06:00 AM)

The market is an area where the seller and buyer meet.
Need for regulation of agriculture markets
In the absence of a regulated market or a formal market structure, the farmers were routinely exploited at the hands of traders and intermediaries, These included secretive price setting, lack of information on demand and supply, adulteration and mixing, poor quality assurance, customary deductions, and delayed payments. Also, there is no counterparty risk assurance or formal dispute resolution mechanism.
APMC Acts:
Introduced in the 1960s in most states, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Acts (APMC Acts)  were passed to regulate the trade between the farmers and the traders by setting up designated marketplaces. The trade was to take place via licensed traders and commission agents. These marketplaces were to be administered by a committee(APMC) that had representatives of the government, farmers, traders, etc.
In order to run the Mandis and build market infrastructure, market fees, taxes, etc were imposed.
This system of Mandi-based trade aimed to ensure that the farmers obtained a price determined by the transparent auctions accompanied by a degree of regulatory oversight in order to ensure fair terms of trade.
Licensed Commission agents(Arhtiyas) are present who broker the trade between farmer and trader. They charge a fee. They help aggregate produce for a trader and also help the farmer in getting better prices from the traders. They can also provide temporary liquidity/finance to the farmer. They also act as the last resort buyer. Usually, there is a lot of trust between farmers and the commission agents.
Issues with APMC Mandis:
Lack of access to Mandis as most States has not invested in building enough Mandi yards. For instance, the average area served by a regulated market is 1 per 117 sq km in Punjab whereas it is 1 per 11000 sq km in Meghalaya.
Lack of market infrastructure in Mandis. Only one-fourth of markets have drying yards. Cold storage units exist in less than one-tenth of the markets. Grading facilities exist in less than one-third of the markets. Electronic weighing scales are available in only a few marketplaces.
The nexus between traders and commission agents often leaves the farmers with little bargaining power leading to poor price realization for the farmer.
The commission agents are known to charge more than the commission for the services which imposes an extra burden on the farmers.
The Committee is dominated by a trader lobby that seeks to keep out the competition by restricting the number of new licenses issued. This behavior leads to non-transparent price discovery.
The large variation across States in the scope and stringency of APMC Acts lead to fragmented markets. Therefore, there is no single national market leading to commodity changing hands as many as five to six times from the farmer to the end consumer which increases the price gap, that is what the farmers receive and what the final consumer pays.
APMC bypass law: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 (Repealed)
Interstate trade and commerce subject was used to pass the three bills as Agriculture comes under the State list.
This act allows farmers to engage in the trade of their agricultural produce outside the physical markets notified under various state Agricultural Produce
Marketing Committee laws (APMC acts).
Benefits of the Act:
The liberalization of the market will introduce corporate and market investment in the industry. These investments can strengthen infrastructure, create a robust supply chain and modernize the sector.
An open market will lead to greater market access to the farmers and an enhanced competition will potentially work to increase the prices for the farmers who are currently at the mercy of middlemen. It will create efficiency games in the downstream agriculture supply chain and these gains will be passed on to the farmers in form of higher output prices. This will lead to the growth of entrepreneurship in agriculture in the form of organized retail, food tech companies, Agri tech startups, etc.
Issues:
Dual regulation as it creates a distinction between APMC Mandis (regulated by State governments) and trade areas (regulated by the Central Act). Thus, creating a regulatory mess.
The failure of a clear mechanism to record, collect and collate transaction data renders all the transactions in the area invisible, thereby making the entire marketing system opaque.
The absence of data is a serious obstacle in ensuring contestability and competition among buyers. It can also hamper the creation of government policy on agriculture trade and food security.
In the absence of a thick market, with many players transacting in the new trade areas, it could leave the prices to the relative bargaining power of the farmer vis-a-vis the buyer.
The dispute resolution mechanism relies on the receipt that the farmers receive as proof of transaction by the SDM rather than the civil court. It is unclear how this mechanism will resolve interstate disputes and disputes over complex issues such as quality just on the basis of transaction receipt.
Without the interoperability of the various electronic platforms, it can lead to fragmentation of the market rather than unification.
There are also concerns about the creation of infrastructure in these new trade areas.

Contract Farming Law: Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020(Repealed)
The act seeks to provide farmers with a framework to engage in contract farming, where farmers can enter into a direct agreement with a buyer (before
sowing season) to sell the produce to them at pre-determined prices.
The new effort is a lighter framework that permits contract farming with minimal obligations.
Benefits:
The availability of contract farming provides a price assurance to the farmers and protects them from the uncertainty of the market.
There is a possibility of the firms providing the farmers with input materials as a part of the contract, thereby reducing their input cost and also improving the quality of the produce.
It ensures a consistent supply of agricultural produce with the desired quality at the right time and lesser cost for the private players.
It provides an opportunity to access new markets which would otherwise not be available to small farmers.
Issues:
Works only for niche commodities where the competing domestic market does not exist.
It creates a placement effect where businesses tend to be selective towards their operating geographical area often choosing areas with better infrastructure, availability of skilled farmers, etc.
Contracting firms may choose to operate in clusters agreeing on prices before the session and committing to not outprice each other. They can also divide the areas among themselves, thereby limiting the competition.
As seen from global experiences the initial cost-saving by the agro-business is passed onto the farmers but they are subsequently squeezed over time, a phenomenon known as agro-business normalization.
It is also common that businesses end up consolidating so that the farmers enjoying the advantages of multiple buyers initially end up facing a single buyer eventually. 
Given the small size of farm holdings, it is extremely challenging and expensive for private players to directly engage with a large number of small farmers. This will lead to the introduction of a large number of intermediaries to negotiate the trade. This will add up to the cost of procurement and ultimately lesser prices will be paid to the farmers.

Essential Commodities(Amendment) Act, 2020(Repealed):
Essential Commodities Act (1955) bestows the center with wide-ranging powers to impose restrictions on the storage and movement of certain ‘essential’ commodities by private parties, mainly to protect consumer interests.
Essential Commodities(Amendment) Act, 2020 attempts to remove the arbitrariness and unpredictability in notifying stocking limits, by linking it to transparent rule-based price triggers. Accordingly, a form of restriction will be deployed only in “exceptional circumstances”.
