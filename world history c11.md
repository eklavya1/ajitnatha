World History Class 11

CONTINUATION OF INTER-WAR YEARS

## FRENCH OCCUPATION OF RUHR, 1923
FRENCH OCCUPATION OF RUHR, 1923(9:02 AM):

The [[economy]] of Germany was devasted post-WW-1 due to high war expenditure and pressure of very harsh war reparations.
By 1922, Germany declared its inability to pay installments of reparations.
France was dependent on reparations for: (a) recovery post-war; (b) for paying back US loans taken to fight WW-1.
France was under US pressure and the US did not recognize the link between reparations and the French ability to pay back US loans.
Therefore, French and Belgium forces crossed demilitarised Rhineland and occupied Ruhr industrial region and ceased goods worth millions of pounds, and forced German workers to continue production.

## Impacts
Germans felt humiliated and anger against France and the Treaty of Versailles increased as even during WW-1, foreign troops had not entered Germany.
German workers responded with Passive resistance by going on strike in Ruhr industrial region(RIR).
The economy of Germany now crashed because RIR was an important hub of manufactured goods, therefore supply crashed and there was galloping inflation-Hyper inflation plus run on the banks and failure of banks.
*Now the US realized* the link between reparations and the French ability to repay US notes.
The crisis in Europe threatened US trade and investments in Europe as by this time US economy was interconnected with European Economy.
Therefore now the US has partially given up the Policy of Isolation by economic intervention in form of the Dawes Plan, 1924.

1924-29:Period of Good Relations in Europe.

DAWES PLAN, 1924
DAWES PLAN, 1924(1:44 PM)

France and Belgium agreed to withdraw from Germany.
The plan was that the US would give a huge amount of cheap loans to Germany.
The German economy will grow to enable Germany to war reparations to France.
Therefore, the French economy will grow to enable France to pay back US loans taken to fight WW-1.
US exports would benefit as economic recovery would increase buying power in France and Germany.
In long term, the US would also recover its loans from France and Germany.
Germany to pay whatever it can in annual installments with respect to the war reparations.
Therefore the success of Dawes's plan depended on the economic stability of the US, Germany, and France as it would give results in long term.

## LOCARNO TREATIES, 1920
LOCARNO TREATIES, 1920(1:50 PM):

Good economic relations created by Dawes's plan set the stage for the decrease in political tensions.
Due to the treaty of Versailles, there was bitterness and disputes regarding borders created by TOV(Treaty of Versailles).
France and Britain guaranteed the borders of  Belgium and Germany agreed and recognized Belgium's borders. Therefore, resolving the dispute between Germany and Belgium.
France guaranteed the borders of Czechoslovakia and Poland. Germany agreed to continued demilitarization of Rhineland.
Germany promised t not to use war to solve borders disputes with Czechoslovakia and Poland and to follow the path of arbitration.
Therefore, the Locarno treaties created an atmosphere of peace in Europe.

However, 

There was no resolution of disputes of Germany with Poland and Czechoslovakia plus borders of Austria were not guaranteed by France and Britain which created anxiety for Italy.
Britain did not guarantee the borders of Poland and Czechoslovakia. Therefore, a full consensus was still missing.
German foreign minister Strassman played a very important role from 1924 to 1929 in decreasing tensions in Europe.

## KELLOGS-BRIAND PACT/PARIS PEACE ACT, 1928
KELLOGS-BRIAND PACT/PARIS PEACE ACT, 1928 (2:33 PM):

It was led by US and France; Signatory nations to this pact denounced the war as a tool of foreign policy. Therefore acts of war now became illegal.
Most nations signed this pact, therefore boosting the atmosphere of peace.
However, it was a paper tiger as there was no punitive clause against those who broke the pact. Therefore, the principle of collective security was missing i.e., the rest of the nations coming to aid victims of aggression against the aggressor.
In 1931, Japan attacked China breaking the pact and the world did nothing.

YOUNG PLAN(2:53 PM):
YOUNG PLAN(2:53 PM):

Dawes Plan had not resolved the dispute over the quantum of war reparations.
Economists like Keynes had suggested 2000 million pounds as the right amount while ToV had put it at 6600 million pounds which were unjust.
In Young Plan, it was decided that Germany to pay 2000 million pounds in 59 years. In 1929, Strassman had died.

LITTLE ENTENTE (3: 10 PM):
LITTLE ENTENTE (3: 10 PM):

In ToV, France wanted to keep Germany permanently weak, and Dawes plan would lead to rising of Germany.
Also after WW-1, Russia turned communist and there was animosity between the capitalist world and USSR.
USSR was not even invited to the treaties of Versailles and was not made a member of the League of Nations.
Therefore, post-WW-1, two fronts against Germany were absent.
Therefore France tried to recreate two fronts by setting up a military alliance with Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania.
Little Entente was very much targeted against USSR as against Germany.
