## Nature and Scope of 1991 Reforms
In order to get out of the macro-economic crisis in [[1991]] , India launched a New Economic Policy, which was based on LPG or Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation model.
Then Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh, was the prime architect of the historic 1991 liberalisation.
The broad range of reforms under the LPG model included:
	Liberalising Industrial Policy: Abolition of industrial license permit raj, Reduction in import tariffs, etc.
	Beginning of Privatisation: Deregulation of markets, Banking reforms, etc.
	Globalisation: Exchange rate correction, liberalising foreign direct investment and trade policies, Removal of mandatory convertibility cause, etc.
	These reforms are credited and applauded for the high economic growth seen from 1991 to [[2011]] and substantial reduction of poverty from [[2005]] to [[2015]].
