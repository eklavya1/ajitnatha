however, cognitive & emotional components of prejudice are more difficult to change

**hence foll strategies can be adopted:**
education & information dissemination for correcting stereotypes
increasing intergroup contact allows for removal for mistrust; direct communication & discovery of positive qualities of outgroup
highlighting individual identity rather than group identity will weaken importance of group as a basis of evaluating other person
removal of prejudice at diff levels of governance
unbiased journalism
discouraging tendency towards negative behaviour among victims of prejudice which in turn reinforces prejudice
