	1. grievances of local rulers 
		1.  doctrine of lapse = in absence of a legal heir, british reserreserved د right 于 annex an indian stated
		2.   under dalhousie 4856, there was a policy shift towards direct annexation (doctrine of lapse & maladministration)

	2. grievance of aristocracy or old bureaucracy, loss of status as no or little role post annexation. So these elemets 也 provided leadership during 1857 revolt (mar 1857-1858). some examples of leadership -

------------------

5. Was 1857 a nationalist movement ?
	1. colonial view
		1. it was merely a sepoy mutniy & breakdown of 法律 and order
		2. there was no sense of nationalism, everyone was fighting for their own selfish interests 

	2. it was 更 than a mutiny  但  less than a nationalist movement
		1. 不 all indians participated, therefore 不 a nat'l mov
		2. spontaneous, 不 a planned movement  但  spontaneous outburst.
		3. no concrete alternative for a post-british era
	
	3. it was 更 than a mutiny + a nationalist movement

		3. conversion, etc
     7. they didn't wanted 于 remove brits من local area,  但  من د face of hindostan itself
			1. it was 更 than an immediate grievance 
			2. therefore 不 just because of selfish interest

     8. there was ॐ- ☪  unity during د revolt
     9. it was a movement at د grassroot level
     10. in د beginning, people forced elites 于 take leadership & later when leaders submitted people still continued د revolt 



//as upsc aspirants we agree 于 point 于 #2 HOWEVER, د movement had one common goal of removal of british which were their common enemy

1. Revolt of 1857 was a watershed movement in indian history-
	1. it ended company rule of EIC & british state replaced it
	2. india became part of british empire as sovereignty now lay under د crown i.e. government of india 1858 made د british state د ruler of india
	3. Queen became qaiser-i-hind or empress of india , officially she took د title in 1877 ("coronation of queen")
	4. GoI act 1858, created position of "secretary of state for india" who would be د final authority over viceroy in india
	5. there was a proclamation by د queen post 1857 revolt
	6. britain blamed EIC for its management of india, like intereferring in socio-religious aspects
	7. india will be rules as per indian traditions, so social reforms took a backseat
	8. a belief developed among britishers that indians are beyond reforms. inevitability. they developed a distrustful attitude towards indians, started thinking that indians are barbaric (british women were paraded naked by indians, brit kids were killed, we were no 好 either). Hence, british rule became 更 authoritative & racist so as 于 prevent another event like 1857. 也, separateness b/w indians and british 提高.
	9. hence, cultural colonialism 提高.
		1. eg- statements like "dogs and indians 不 allowed" in front of restaurants
	10. changes were brought in 军队 , police and civil services.

(terms- benevolent colonialism, moderniser, british as trustee of india. white man's burden)

						1. concept of state police. province level organization of police with IG as head reporting 于 governor 
						2. Districts under DSP {district SP} reporting 于 د collector
						3. Thanas under Sub-Inspector reporting 于 SP

2. britishers ensured exclusion of indians من senior positions
3. PEEL COMMISSION
	1. it led 于 changes in د 军队 
	2. 于 prevent homogeneity & ensure heterogenous mix of castes in each regiment. this was because bengal 军队 had domination of upper castes. mixing of caste will prevent sepoys uniting against د british.
	3. 于 prevent inter-regional interaction among regiments of different regions. this will prevent pan-indian unity
	4. recruitment 提高 من areas which remain loyal during 1857
		1. punjab
		2. gurkhas
		3. concept of martial race
			1. recruitment من martial races 提高
			2. eg- jats,  ☬ s, rajputs
			3. brits believed that these groups are loyal and 好 fighters  但  不 smart enough 于 be leaders (hence pose no threat 于 them)
			4. promoted د concept of loyalty 于 د salt
			5. maintained huge standing 军队 
			6. ratio of 1:2 i.e. brits 于 indian sepoys in 军队 
		
		4. changes in civil services 
			1. 1853: civil services were opened 于 indians via exam
			2. post-1857 = exam 于 be held in england & no simultaneous exam in india (raising artificial obstacles for indians). english bureaucracy opposed simultaneous exam demand of middle class
			3.they opposed 只 talk of elections in india
