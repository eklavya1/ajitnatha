in May and June 1875, peasants of Maharashtra in some parts of Pune and Ahmednagar districts revolted against increasing agrarian distress.  The Deccan Riots of 1875 targeted conditions of debt peonage (kamiuti) to  moneylenders.  The rioters' specific purpose was to obtain and destroy the bonds, decrees, and other documents in the possession of the moneylenders.[1] The peasants began a systematic attack on the moneylendersâ€™ houses and shops. They seized and publicly burnt debt bonds and deeds signed under pressure, in ignorance, or through fraud and other documents dealing with their debts. They socially boycotted the moneylenders. Within days the disturbances spread to other villages of the Poona and Ahmednagar districts, although there was no anti-colonial consciousness among them.
