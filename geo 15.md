mt tambora
mt luzon

volcan sangay

types of volcanoes

active: which has recorded eruption in lifespan of human beings
dormant: it has not recorded eruption but can erupt in future.
extinct: it's inactive volcano that has no connection with magma chamber. 

geomagnetism

magnetic field associated with earth is c/a geomagnetism.
earth has outer rocky mantle, below which, there is a liquid outer core, which surrounds solid center.
it's considered that motion of charges, i.e., iron in liquid part of earth's core creates a magnetic field.
motion of charges in outer core is caused by: 
rotation of earth
heat rising from earth's central core results in generation of convection currents of molten material in outer core.
motion of ions in this molten material would produce electric current through earth's core that results in a magnetic field around earth.

paleomagnetism:

historical study of earth's magnetism through its rocks is c/a paleomagnetism.
when magma crystallizes, crystals of ferromagnetic minerals such as iron, titanium, etc acquire stable magnetism which becomes frozen as magma cools down.
this acquired magnetism is c/a fossil magnetism.
such rocks will have ferromagnetic minerals aligned in same direction as that of geomagnetic field at time of its consolidation.
when paleomagnetic evidence for a given region was checked over a long period of time, a gradual change in direction can be detected.
it shows that position of magnetic poles has moved steadily over time.
this movement is c/a polar wandering.
during study of oceanic surfaces, some rocks are pointed towards north & some towards south.
it's inferred that rocks did not change their polarity but it's earth's magnetic pole that reversed its polarity.
such reversal of magnetic field can be brought by reversal of convection currents in outer core. 
magnetic reversals are usually experienced every 200,000-3000,000 years.

auroras

when electrically charged particles from solar winds interact with earth's magnetic field near-polar regions, it produces spectacular lights c/a auroras.
north pole- aurora borealis; south pole- aurora australis.

earthquakes

vibration or oscillation of earth caused by a transient disturbance of elastic or gravitational equilibrium of rocks at or beneath surface of earth.
scientific study of earthquakes is c/a seismology.

causes of earthquake

natural:
plate movements
volcanic eruptions.
subsidence.
landslides.
meteoritic impact.
anthropogenic causes
mining.
nuclear explosion.
reservoir-induced seismicity.

earthquake waves.

focus- point at which energy is being released, below surface.
epicenter- it's point on surface nearer to focus.
body waves:
these are earthquake waves generated from focus & move through interior of earth.
there are 2 types of body waves- p waves & s waves.
p waves:
they are also c/a primary waves or compressional waves.
they oscillate back & forth in direction of propagation & they depend on compressibility of material.
they can pass through solids, liquids, & gases.
s waves:
secondary waves or transverse waves.
oscillation as a wave occurs perpendicular to direction of propagation & it's dependent on rigidity of material & therefore, it can not pass through liquid & gases.
surface waves:
these are earthquake waves generated from epicenter & are confined to surface of earth.
they are much slower than body waves but can cause more damage, for ex- love waves & rayleigh raves.

shadow zone.

it's zone in interior of earth, where earthquake waves are not reported.
p waves are not detected b/w 105 degrees to 145 degrees from focus, which is c/a p wave shadow zone.
s waves can not pass through outer core as it's liquid, & hence, beyond 105 degrees, s waves are not reported resulting in s waves shadow zone.
seismic waves undergo reflection, bending, or change in speed while passing from 1 medium to another. this is main reason responsible for creation of shadow zones in interior of earth.
by an
by analyzing these recordings i.e. time of arrival, speed of waves, & direction of earthquake waves, we can conclude about nature of earth's interior.

types of earthquakes.

shallow- 0 to 70 km.
intermediate- 70 to 350 km.
deep-seated- 350 to 700 km.

distribution of earthquakes.

most common or intense earthquakes are witnessed in pacific rings of fire, also c/a a circum-pacific belt.
mediterranean & trans-asiatic belt.
mid-atlantic ridge.
east-african rift system.

topic for next class: measurement of earthquake.
