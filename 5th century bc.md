- the 5th century bc started the first day of 500 bc and ended the last day of 401 bc.



this century saw the establishment of pataliputra as a capital of the magadha empire. this city would later become the ruling capital of different indian kingdoms for about a thousand years. this period saw the rise of two great philosophical schools of the east, jainism and buddhism. 

this period saw mahavira and buddha spreading their respective teachings in the northern plains of india. this essentially changed the socio-cultural and political dynamics of the region of south asia. buddhism would later go on to become one of the major world religions.

this period also saw the work of yaska, who created nirukta, that would lay the foundation stone for sanskrit grammar and is one of the oldest works on grammar known to mankind.  

this century is also traditionally recognized as the classical period of the greeks, which would continue all the way through the 4th century until the time of alexander the great. the life of socrates represented a major milestone in greek philosophy though his teachings only survive through the work of his students, most notably plato and xenophon. the tragedians aeschylus, sophocles, and euripides, as well as the comedian aristophanes all date from this era and many of their works are still considered classics of the western theatrical canon.

the persian wars, fought between a coalition of greek cities and the vast achaemenid persian empire was a pivotal moment in greek politics. after having successfully prevented the annexation of greece by the persians, sparta, the dominant power in the coalition, had no intention of further offensive action and considered the war over. meanwhile, athens counter-attacked, liberating greek subjects of the persian empire up and down the ionian coast and mobilizing a new coalition, the delian league. tensions between athens, and its growing imperialistic ambitions as leader of the delian league, and the traditionally dominant sparta led to a protracted stalemate in the peloponnesian war.
