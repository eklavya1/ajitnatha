ACR is a 444-hectare stretch of the Asan River running down to its confluence with the Yamuna River in the Dehradun district of Uttarakhand.
It is Uttarakhand's first Ramsar Site.
The damming of the River by the Asan Barrage in 1967 resulted in siltation above the dam wall, which helped to create some of the Site's bird-friendly habitats.
These habitats support 330 species of birds including the critically endangered red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis), and Baer's pochard (Aythya baeri).
