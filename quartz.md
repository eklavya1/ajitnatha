quartz is a typical example of a crystalline solid, **while** quartz glass is an example of an amorphous solid.
the other example of crystalline solid include - [[sodium chloride]], etc. [[glass]], [[rubber]], etc. are other examples of amorphous solids.

*crystalline solids have long-range order, while amorphous solids have short-range order*. this means that crystalline solids have a regular pattern of arrangement of particles which repeats itself periodically over the entire crystal. in amorphous solids, a regular and periodically repeating pattem is observed over short distances only.

amorphous solids have a structure similar to that of liquids. like liquids, they have a tendency to flow. they are known as pseudo solids or supercooled liquids.

crystalline solids are anisotropic in nature. this means some of their physical properties (electrical resistance, refractive index, etc.) show different values when measured along different directions in the same crystal.
