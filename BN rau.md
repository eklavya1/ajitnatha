He observed that Directive Principles are like moral precepts for the state authorities and are open to facile criticism that the constitution is not the place for moral precepts. But they have an educative value and most modern constitutions lay down general principles of this kind.
Benegal Narsing Rau was the Constitutional Advisor to [[Constituent Assembly]].

L.M. Singhvi, an eminent jurist, and diplomat said that the Directive Principles are the life-giving provisions of the Constitution.
T.T. Krishnamachari described the Directive Principles as '*a veritable dustbin of sentiments*.'
K Santhanam has pointed out that the Directives lead to a constitutional conflict

	Between the President and the Prime Minister, and
	Between the governor and the chief minister.
According to him, the Centre can give directions to the states concerning the implementation of these principles, and in case of non compliance, can dismiss the state government.
