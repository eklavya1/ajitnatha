kasai district (french: district du kasai, dutch: district kasai) was a district of the congo free state, belgian congo and the democratic republic of the congo, named after the [[kasai river]]. it was formed around 1885 and went through several large changes in extent in the years that followed. the 1933 version of the district roughly corresponded to the former kasai-occidental province and the present kasaï and kasaï-central provinces.
