[[geo 33 end of climatology]] [[tidal ports]]

nice explanation
neap tide - diagonal
spring tide - moon + sun's  gravity combined
high tide = 2 bulges on [[earth]] due to moon's gravity + earth's [[centrifugal force]]

	- the regular rise & fall of water level in the world's oceans resulting from [[gravitational force]] by the [[moon]] & [[sun]] is called as tide.
	- `04:08 PM 16/8/2021` - the combined gravitational pull of sun & [[moon]] pulls the oceanic water in a bulge. the centrifugal force due to [[earth]]'s revolution pulls another bulge in opposite direction. the bulges in one direction creates low water in another { [[zero-sum game]] }. as the earth rotates this position of high & low waters changes across the surface. (similarly [[superpower]] come and occupy the position of superpowerness for some time !)
# factors affecting tides
- 04:13 PM 16/8/2021
* gravitational pull of sun & moon
* relative position of sun & moon
* [[centrifugal force]] of [[earth]]'s revolution
* uneven distribution of water ðŸ¥¤ #doubt 
* [[ocean]] bottom [[topography]]
		- shallow coastal surfaces will exp more tidal eff (ie more rising and declining of water level) than coastal areas with a steep ocean bottom (as water will rise up and down there)
# TYPES OF TIDES
- `04:47 PM 16/8/2021`
## spring tide
- spring & neap tides pic
- ![[Pasted image 20210816164157.png]]
- a very High tide & a very low Low tide occurs in during 2 conditions
	1. conjunction - ie new moon & sun are aligned together
	2. opposition - full moon
- during spring tide, sun, earth & moon are in a straight line ie `sygyzy position` #pre 
## neap tide
- the smaller high tides & smaller low tides experienced when sun & [[moon]] are in perpendicular direction, the position is called as [[quadrature]]
## diurnal & semi-diurnal tides
- 04:53 PM 16/8/2021
- not that imp for [[mains]], only factors is imp
- the tides occurring _twice a day_ also called as semi-diurnal tides #doubt - it should be diurnal ???
- the tides occurring _once a day_ also called as diurnal tides
# significance of tides
- 05:06 PM 16/8/2021
- `positive impacts`
	- helps in the generation of [[tidal energy]] (tidal port)
	- helps in the [[navigation]] for ships
	- helpful for shipbuilding industry 
	- helps in the natural cleansing of `coastal region` as well as *deposition of waste*
	- helps in maintaining [[biodiversity]] along `tidal range` with favorable conditions for both the ecosystems 05:14 PM 16/8/2021
	- many of the [[fish]] [[species]] come to the upper regions to lay eggs
	ian		- hilsa fish of [[bengal]] ---> very costly #pre 
- `negative impacts`
	- coastal erosion & coastal flooding
	- adversely impacts `delta formation`
	- Tides move water, bringing water in and taking water out.
	- aids é‡Œ é±¼ing & é‡Œ [[navigation]]
	- helps é‡Œ prevention of [[siltation]] in harbours. 
	- é«˜ tide å¸®s å¤§ ships to enter å’Œ leave
	- Ø¯ [[tidal ports]] are Ø¯ ones in which water levels within Ø¯ port is subject to change with ocean tides.
		- Kandla and Diamond Harbours are examples of [[tidal ports]]. #pre
