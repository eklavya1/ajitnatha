**Fundamental rights are provided in Part Ill of the Indian Constitution.
The Constitution guarantees six fundamental rights to *Indian citizens* as follows:

	Right to Equality (Article 14-18)

	Right against Exploitation (Article 23-24)
	Right to Freedom of Religion (Article 25-28)
	Cultural and Educational Rights (Article 29-30)
	Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)

While these fundamental rights are universal, the Constitution provides for some exceptions and restrictions.
Besides, few fundamental rights are exclusive to the citizens of India. These are:
	Right against discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth (Article 15).

It is known as the base of the Indian constitution & mentioned in Part Ill of the constitution.
It prohibits unreasonable interference of the state & prevents its executive & legislature to become authoritarian, hence putting due limitations on state power.
Observance of fundamental duties is required for having one's FRS redressed in case of their violation.
It is not absolute but qualified rights.
It is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the state on the question of national security, interest & general welfare of the society.
But restrictions are checked by SC & HCs, whether restrictions are reasonable or not.
SC verdict in the Golaknath VIS state of Punjab (1967) - FRS have been given a transcendental position by constitution hence no authority functioning under the constitution including parliament has the power to amend FRS.
In Keshavananda Bharati VIS state of Kerala, 1973, SC held that parliament has the power to amend any provision of the constitution including part Ill, however, parliaments amending power subjects to the "Basic structure of the constitution".
