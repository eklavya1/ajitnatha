the english channel, also called simply the channel, is an arm of the atlantic ocean that separates southern england from northern france and links to the southern part of the north sea by the strait of dover at its northeastern end. it is the busiest shipping area in the world.it is about 350 statute miles (560 kilometres; 300 nautical miles) long and varies in width from 150 mi (130 nmi; 240 km) at its widest to 21 mi (18 nmi; 34 km) in the strait of dover. it is the smallest of the shallow seas around the continental shelf of europe, covering an area of some 29,000 square miles (22,000 square nautical miles; 75,000 square kilometres).the channel was a key factor in britain becoming a naval superpower and has been utilised by britain as a natural defence mechanism by which many would-be invasions, such as the napoleonic wars and those of adolf hitler in world war ii, were halted.

the population around the english channel is predominantly located on the english coast and the major languages spoken in this region are french and english.
