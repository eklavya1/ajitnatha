Seven Years of Global War ([[1754]]-[[1763]]): (9:09 am)
[[third carnatic war]]
Winston Churchill referred to Seven Years Global War as the real World War I, as it was fought,
(a) between major world powers of the time,
(b) across the world i.e. on different continents.
Settlers: They are the foreigners who come to occupy the territory of indigenous people (original inhabitants) and start living there i.e. they settle in the colony. E.g. Settlers from Britain occupied or settled in 13 colonies of Britain in North America.
These colonies were established or set up in the [[1600]]s.
American Indians/Native Indians/Red Indians: They are the original inhabitants of North America.
The British settlers took over their lands in 13 colonies and now they lived west of the Appalachian Mountains (under the control of France).
Before Industrialisation, it was the lure or attraction of agricultural lands that brought settlers to continents outside Europe.

## Reasons of War in America
Reasons of War in America:  (9:51 am)

Britain wanted to dominate the whole of North America. On the east coast of North America were basically 13 colonies of Britain.
France controlled Canada and territory to the west of Appalachian mountains, Spain had Florida which is modern-day Mexico.
For France and Spain, core interests were the sugar islands of Central America as they earned huge profits from exports of sugar grown in plantation systems established in the islands of Central America.
France and Spain feared that their colonies in Central America will come under threat if the British is allowed to dominate the whole of North America. Therefore, this becomes the reason for conflict in America.
India: There was rivalry between Britain and France for control over the trade of India with the rest of the world and their respective governments supported English East India and French East India companies.
Africa: Rivalry between Britain and France over Senegal on the west coast of Africa, which was rich in the natural resource of gum.
Europe: here Prussia engaged in territorial expansion against the Austrian empire which was opposed by other European powers.
Britain was an ally of Prussia and in Europe, they fought against France, Spain, Austria, and Russia.
Settlers and Native Indians: British settlers of 13 colonies wanted Britain to take over territories to the west of the Appalachian mountains. So they could become big landowners.
In 13 colonies majority of the lands were owned by the British Aristocrats and settlers had to pay rents on these lands.
American Indians had control over their land under France as there was little presence of French settlers. Therefore, they opposed the British expansion as it would mean the loss of their lands to British settlers.

**Results of War**: The British won the Seven Years War (1754-63) as they had a superior military especially a superior navy.
Wars are costly and the British were monetarily powerful due to accumulating trade profits. [[george friedman]]
Britain had also begun industrialization from around the middle of the 18th Century while France was under economic stress. E.g. In India, the soldiers were not paid for months.
The war was fought on multiple continents, therefore, it was a logistically difficult exercise to move troops, arms and ammunition, and food i.e. supplies for troops.
British got an edge in North America as they raised a local army from among the British settlers of 13 colonies.
American Indians fought on side of France *but they were not trained in modern warfare*.
British strengthened Prussia by supplying it with arms and ammunition and money. Therefore, forcing France to divert resources to Europe weakened it in the rest of the theatres of war and this strategy helped the British.

**Result**: Treaty of Paris 1763, (a) India: After a decisive victory over France, in Battle of Wandiwash in 1760 as part of Carnatic War III, the Treaty of Paris 1763, restricted France to Pondicherry in India, and Britain now controlled the trade of India with rest of World.
In Senegal, France was defeated and Senegal was taken over by the British.
In Europe, Prussia established its firm control over Silesia.
In America: The whole of North America came under British domination as France lost all its territories in North America (Canada, Louisiana, all territories of west of Appalachian).
Spain lost Florida to Britain and in exchange, French Louisiana was given to Spain.
France and Spain were allowed to retain their core interest i.e., their colonies in Central America.
Victory in Seven Years War (1754-63) resulted in a decisive shift in the balance of power in favour of Britain. Britain emerged as a top world power.
As it was a big military defeat for France, the British colonial empire expanded.
Britain got control over lucrative Indian trade and also around this time Britain has begun industrialization.
Therefore by mid 18th Century, Britain emerged as the top power.

## American Revolution (1765 to 1783)
American Revolution (1765 to 1783): (11:09 am)

American Revolution is basically divided into two parts: the American Civilian protest (1765-76) and the American War of Independence (1776-83) by the British settlers of 13 colonies.
Reasons: Proclamation of 1763: Britain was under economic stress due to high war expenditure. The govt. had floated bonds to raise money for wars and now it was feared that the government would default on its debt obligation. Therefore, Britain wanted the end of the war.
The American Indians had continued fighting despite the victory of Britain over France and Spain as they feared the loss of their lands to British settlers.
Therefore, the British Parliament issued the Proclamation of 1763 which barred territorial expansion by the British settlers to the west of Appalachians.
Created Indian reserve for American Indians.
Stamp Act of 1765: It was an additional tax imposed on 13 colonies by taxing all sale purchases of paper therefore, it increased the cost of all transactions based on paper. Like all business transactions, lottery, etc.
The British wanted to recover war expenditure incurred during Seven Years War (1754-63). This triggered the American Revolution (1765-83).
British Mercantilism/ Mercantile Capitalism: Britain followed the policy of mercantilism in world affairs and therefore, the 13 colonies were also a victim of British mercantilism.
Mercantilism/Mercantile capitalism implied following such policies and taking such executive actions that result in maximization of the flow of gold into Britain by maximizing the positive balance of trade i.e. net export in value terms.
*Britain misused its sovereign power over 13 colonies* i.e. legislative and executive power to economically exploit and drain wealth from colonies. And therefore, achieve goals of policy of mercantilism.
Such policies were adopted which forced the colonies to buy British goods.
Therefore, artificially creating demand for British industries. In this process, the colonies were prevented from industrialising their economy. So, they were dependent on British imports.
They were also denied the choice of trade with the rest of the world. And therefore, they suffered a notional loss.
Preferential Tariffs for British goods i.e high import duty on non-British goods.
They canâ€™t set up any indigenous industry in textiles and steel sectors.
Certain raw materials could be exported only to Britain and were denied the choice to sell at a better price to others. It helped fund British industrialization as now assured supply of raw materials for British industry.
Navigation Act of 1651 made it mandatory for 13 colonies to use only British ships for exports from colonies. [[1651]]
Therefore British colonialism took the form of [[mercantilism]].
