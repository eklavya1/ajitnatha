- an overview of previous class was given (1.08 pm)
## some other indices (1.15 pm)
- these are subjective in [[nature]].
- gross national happiness
- green gdp- it was proposed at copenhagen summit.
- it takes into account aspects of environmental destruction or addition while calculating gdp.
- objective value cannot be determined of goods and services exactly.

## inflation (1.35 pm)
- it means a general rise in prices.
- objective
- to understand meaning of inflation
- look at terms related to inflation
- causes of inflation
- measurement of inflation
- effects of inflation on different entities
- controlling inflation
- at same time, gdps numbers are readily available and their measurement is largely standardized leading to easiness of comparison amongst different economies.
- that’s why despite its shortcomings, gdp is most widely used indicator of economic output and growth.
## inflation
- it is a general and sustained rise in prices in economy. 
- rise in price: earlier 1 apple was costing 2 dozen bananas but now it is costing 4 dozen bananas.
- price rise happens because of other goods as well. 
- dictation (2.12 pm)
- price of a good refers to its market value which is measured in certain units. 
- commonly, units in which prices are measured are currency when we talk about inflation, we refer to rise in price of goods and services. 
- rise in prices can be caused either independently for goods themselves or with change in value of unit (ie currency) which is used to find price of good.
- usually while studying inflation, we assume measurement unit to be constant in its own value. 
- however, in reality, value of currency has a great impact on prices of goods. 
- reasons for rise in prices (2.19 pm)
- price is not determined by customer. price is determined by market which determines demand.
- price is independent variable and demand is dependent variable.
## dictation (2.34 pm)
- price of a good is dependent upon multiple factors such as cost of inputs, profit margin that producer wishes to take, demand of good, and supply of good. 
- when quantity demanded exceeds supply, there is upward pressure on price, whereas quantity demanded is less than quantity supplies there is a tendency for price to reduce.
- inflation refers to a general rise in price level, not of one particular good or a bunch of goods but all goods are taken together.
- factors mentioned above pertain to price of one good. however, at economy-wide level, these factors can be seen to influence general prices as well.
- it means that general price level in economy can be seen to be composed of prices of all goods in economy.
- if in general, cost of inputs increases or profit margins change, or there is a general increase in demand that is aggregate demand rises or there is a general supply shock ie production reduces at economy-wide level, it will manifest in a general rise in prices and thus cause inflation.
- specific reasons
- demand-pull reason: anything which causes an increase in demand. 
- quantity demanded may increase because of changes in consumption patterns. eg- people are now demanding more eggs
- rise in incomes- due to an increase in income, people may demand more commodities. 
- increase in population
- implicit factor is increase in availability of money. 
- cost-push factors: these are supply-side factors. 
- factors of production- if price of factors of production increases or we want more profit, then supply will be reduced.
- alternate use of product- eg- use of guar gum in extraction of shale gas. this led to an increase in prices of guar gum.
- infrastructural bottlenecks- eg- 6% of total production of food grains is wasted due to lack of storage. 
- administered price- fair and remunerative prices of sugarcane. it will increase prices.
- other reasons for inflation
- deterioration of currency.
- international factors: disruption in supply of crude oil, edible oil. 
- restrictive/ free trade policies.
- [[black economy]]- more money chasing less number of goods. it is economy, which is not accounted for.
- terms related to inflation (3.37 pm)
- inflation is already discussed. 
- deflation- opposite of inflation.

- [[disinflation]]- it is a fall in *rate* of increase of prices that is a fall in rate of inflation. in a disinflationary situation prices still rise but at a slower pace than before.

- [[hyperinflation]]- extremely high rate of inflation. eg- zimbabwe’s economy had 10000% inflation a few years back.
- creeping/ trotting-  slow, steady rising inflation.
- [[skewflation]]- goods which are causing prices of other goods to rise. 
- structural inflation- poor infrastructure causing an increase in prices. 
- [[stagflation]] (recession)- is a situation that consists of stagnation in economic output accompanied by high inflation. it is usually described as a situation in which both employment and inflation rise simultaneously. 
- note: refer to growth inflation trade-off in monetary policy. 
- [[stagflation]] is an exceptional situation that is it is not normally expected that inflation and unemployment will both be high together at same time.
- stagflation is this exceptional situation.

- topic for next class: inflation (to be continued)
