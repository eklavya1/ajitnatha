Drawbacks of Green revolution(1:02:00PM)

It distorted the production patterns by focusing on just two crops: rice and wheat. India faces a huge scarcity of pulses and oilseeds, thereby increasing the demand for imports. 
Regional inequalities: Most of the benefits were corned by a few states such as Punjab, Haryana, Western UP, parts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. It neglected all the other parts - hilly regions, eastern India, northeastern region, coastal regions, etc.
It led to interpersonal inequality- the small and marginal farmers were neglected.
The green revolution has led to environmental damage including land degradation or soil degradation due to excessive use of fertilisers, depletion of groundwater, eutrophication of water bodies and harms to human health due to seepage of heavy metals in water and soil.
The institutional and structural reforms such as land reforms, the formation of cooperatives were neglected by the government.
As the Green revolution was backed by government subsidies, it created a capitalist mode of agriculture backed by government support which is difficult to curtail, hence making agriculture unsustainable.
The burden of subsidies compromised the capital expenditure in agriculture that is poor development of irrigation facilities, warehousing, etc.

Agricultural marketing(1:34:00PM)

Agricultural marketing consists of all activities, agencies and policies involved in the procurement of farm inputs by the farmers and movement of agricultural products from the farm to the consumer. The various activities involved are- procurement, collection, grading, storage, processing, transportation, financing, wholesale and retail sale of the produce.
Objectives of an efficient marketing system:
It enables the farmers as primary producers to reap the best possible benefits that include monetising the produce, price discovery, etc.
It provides market intelligence to the farmers that help them make cropping decisions.
To provide facilities for lifting the produce, the farmers are willing to sell at a price incentive.
To make available all the products of farm origin to the consumers at affordable prices without impairing the quality of produce.
To reduce the price spread between the producer and ultimate consumer.
As marketing gets more effective, it generates the need for investment in supply chain infrastructure and incentivises the use of technology across all farming practices.

Goverment interventions(2:01:00pm)

1. Input subsidies
Subsidies are transfer payments from the government which means it is a one-sided payment where there is no exchange of goods and services in return.
The starting point of Indian agriculture was the concern for food security that necessitated the need for subsidies.
Increasing the production and intensity of agriculture were the prime motivators for this policy intervention.
Need for subsidies in agriculture:
To increase the application of inputs that will help increase the production of agriculture 
To guard against price fluctuation, for example, an increase in production can lead to an increase in supply which will reduce the prices and hence disincentivise further production.
The subsidisation of inputs can positively influence the acceptance of new technology.
Input subsidy can have a moderating effect on food prices and can help control food inflation.
Farm subsidies cushion the pain of structural transformation, that is, the decline in agriculture income share is faster than its decline in employment share which results in a substantial disparity in workers' income and productivity across sectors.
The negative impact of subsidies:
It incentivises mismanagement as the inputs are available at low/no costs.
The exploitation of resources. For example- Groundwater in Punjab.
Compromises capital expenditure as the government is already spending money on subsidies.
Huge burden on the government and also it is difficult to take subsidies back once they are introduced due to political reasons.
Types of subsidies:
Direct subsidy
The direct subsidy is given in the form of cash transfers. Example- PM KISAN: Rs 6000/annum is given to all landholding farmers
Indirect subsidy
Getting a subsidy in-kind means the government is giving a subsidised product. Example: Power subsidy, fertiliser subsidy, insurance subsidy, loan waivers, etc.
Problems with indirect subsidy:
Corruption is present. There are a lot of leakages where the product is directed to other users. The major cause of leakage is the existence of two prices for the same product. Examples- As per Economic Survey, around 40% of subsidised fertiliser bags were diverted to Nepal and Bangladesh, Credit taken for agricultural purposes is used for other purposes, Electricity theft in the power sector, etc.
Rich and influential farmers get most of the benefits while the small and marginal farmers are left behind.
The administrative cost incurred in procurement, storage and transportation of the product to the last mile is huge.
Efficiency effect- It impacts the timing of delivery. For example, the government recently increased the subsidy on a fertiliser called Di-ammonium Phosphate(DAP), however, it is of no use if the fertiliser does not reach the farmer on time.
Constraints the freedom of farmers as it is limited to certain products and leaves no choice for the farmers.
Challenges of direct subsidies:
Purpose can not be controlled and it is up to the beneficiary to utilise the money as they like. For example- The subsidy can also be spent for consumption purposes and on activities like gambling, drinking, etc.
Identification of beneficiaries is a challenge- both exclusion(the eligible persons are left out) and inclusion errors(ineligible persons are included).
Financial infrastructure and poor financial literacy is also a major challenge. Online scams and frauds are quite common.
Difficulty in cases of broken supply chains. The beneficiary has the money but is unable to utilise it as the required resource is not available.
Inflation is a big challenge. If the direct subsidy is not linked with inflation, then the actual value delivered to be beneficiary decreases over a period of time.
2. Pricing policy
Need:
It insulates the farmers from the unwanted fluctuation in price caused by the variation in supply, lack of market integration, information asymmetry and other elements of market imperfection.
The guaranteed price and assured market are expected to encourage higher investment and adoption of modern technologies in agricultural activities.
It will encourage the farmer to create a surplus and will ensure the marketisation of that surplus. A minimum support price can also protect the consumer from excessive price rises.
Structure
The government set up the Food Corporation of India in 1964 to run its PDS operations, maintain a buffer stock of grains and maintain price stability in the market.
In 1965, an Agricultural Price Commission was set up to recommend the price of agricultural commodities. This commission was renamed as Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices(CACP) in 1974.
Minimum Support Price
They are in the nature of a long term guarantee to the producers so that in the event of a glut, prices are not allowed to fall below this. It was intended to serve as a floor price and an assurance against the risk that could arise from a sharp fall in market price. The government implemented this by buying commodities at these declared minimum prices.
Procurement price
They were fixed at a higher level as compared to MSP and were meant essentially to maintain the buffer stock and for distribution under the PDS. This provided the farmers with the choice to avail either the market price or sell to the public agencies at procurement price.
However, the procurement price became the MSP and this MSP was is also used as a market price benchmark.
