- Attingal Outbreak (Anjengo Revolt; April–October 1721) refers to the massacre of 140 East India Company soldiers by native Indians and the following siege of Fort Anjengo. The Attingal Outbreak is often regarded as the first organized revolt against [[British]] authority in Malabar, Cochin and [[Travancore]]. The main reasons behind the resentment was large scale corruption and the manipulation of black pepper prices by the Company. 

- • Recently the observance of the 300th anniversary of the Attingal Revolt of 1721, the first organized [[rebellion]] against the [[EIC]], began at the Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan in [[kerala]]. The 300th anniversary of the revolt is being observed as part of the celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of [[Independence]].  The British used to send to the Queen of Attingal costly gifts from the Fort of Anjengo annually. In 1721, around 140 Britons started their journey from Anjengo to the palace of Attingal. Meanwhile, the [[Pillamars]], the local rulers, demanded that the gifts be presented to the Queen through them only. But [[British]] were not ready to accept it. The people became furious and they attacked and killed the Britons.
