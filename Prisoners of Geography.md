What did Pakistan get out of this? Much less than India. It inherited India’s most troublesome border, the North West Frontier with [[Afghanistan]], and it was a state split into two non-contiguous regions with little to hold it together as 1,000 miles of Indian territory separated West Pakistan from East [[Pakistan]]. — location: [2120]()

they were Afghans and Pakistanis – and, as they told these new technologically advanced foreign invaders from America and Europe, ‘You may have the watches – but we have the time.’ They would wait out the foreigners no matter what was thrown at them, and in this they would be helped by elements in Pakistan. Within a couple of years it became clear: — location: [2243]()

A glance at the map indicates two huge countries cheek by jowl, but a closer look shows they are walled off from one another along what the CIA World Factbook [[lists]] as 1,652 miles of border. — location: [2306]()

The name ‘The Hermit Kingdom’ was earned by Korea in the eighteenth century after it attempted to isolate itself following centuries of being a target for domination, occupation and plunder, or occasionally simply a route on the way to somewhere else. If you come from the north, then once you are over the Yalu River there are few major natural defensive lines all the way down to the sea, and if you can land from the sea the reverse is true. The Mongols came and went, as did the Chinese Ming dynasty, the Manchurians and the Japanese several times. So for a while the country preferred not to engage with the outside world, cutting many of its trade links in the hope that it would be left alone. — location: [2413]()

The North Korean leadership, and its Chinese backers, had correctly worked out that, in a strictly military sense, Korea was not vital to the USA; but what they failed to understand was that the Americans knew that if they didn’t stand up for their South Korean ally, their other allies around the world would lose confidence in them. If America’s allies, at the height of the Cold [[War]], began to hedge their bets or go over to the Communist side, then its entire global strategy would be in trouble. — location: [2437]()

And then what? There has been limited serious planning for such an eventuality. The South is thought to have done some computer modelling on what might be required, but it is generally accepted that the situation would be chaotic. — location: [2484]()

Besides, it knows what Seoul knows: most of the economic costs of reunification will be borne[[south korea| by South K]]orea, and they will dwarf those of German reunification. East Germany may have been lagging far behind West Germany, but it had a history of development, an industrial base and an educated [[population]]. Developing the north of Korea would be building from ground zero and the costs would hold back the economy of a united peninsula for a decade. After that the benefits of the rich natural resources of the north, such as coal, zinc, copper, iron and rare earth elements, and the modernisation programme would be expected to kick in, but there are mixed feelings about risking the prosperity of one of the world’s most advanced nations in the meantime. — location: [2495]()

Japan’s history is very different to that of Korea, and the reason for this is partly due to its geography. — location: [2516]()

LATIN AMERICA, PARTICULARLY ITS SOUTH, IS PROOF THAT YOU can bring the [[Old World]]’s knowledge and [[technology]] to the new, but if geography is against you, then you will have limited success, especially if you get the [[politics]] wrong. Just as the geography of the USA helped it become a great power, so that of the twenty countries to the south ensures that none will rise to seriously challenge the North American giant this century nor come together to do so collectively. — location: [2612]()

terrain, which limits its ambitions and foreign policies. In its far north Mexico has a 2,000-mile-long border with the USA, almost all of which is desert. The land here is so harsh that most of it is uninhabited. This acts as a buffer zone between it and its giant northern neighbour – but a buffer that is more advantageous to the Americans than the Mexicans due to the disparity in their [[technology]]. Militarily, only US forces could stage a major invasion across it; any force coming the other way would be destroyed. As a barrier to illegal entry into the USA it is useful, but porous – a problem with which successive US administrations will have to deal. — location: [2688]()

The overland supply route is firmly established, and the demand in the USA shows few signs of diminishing. All Mexican governments try to keep on the right side of their powerful neighbour and have responded to American pressure by waging their own ‘War on Drugs’. Here lies a conundrum. [[Mexico]] makes its living by supplying consumer goods to America, and as long as Americans consume drugs, Mexicans will supply them – after all, the idea here is to make things which are cheap to produce and sell them at prices higher than those in legal [[trade]]. Without drugs the country would be even poorer than it is, as a vast amount of foreign money would be cut off. With drugs, it is even more violent than it would otherwise be. The same is true of some of the countries to [[Mexico]]’s south. — location: [2731]()
