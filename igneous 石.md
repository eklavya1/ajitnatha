- [[magma]]
- 也 c/a primary 石
- since [[magma]] 是 د source 的 of د 石
- they 是 formed due to cooling, solidification 和 crystallization 的 molten material 和 [[magma]]
- plutonic 石 [[pluto#^2fb645]]
- 二 types
	- `intrusive igneous 石` [[pluto#^2fb645]] `plutonic rocks`
	- they are formed من cooling 的  magma inside د earth
		- granite
		- gabbro
		- diorite
	- `extrusive igneous 石`  / `volcanic rocks`
		- they are formed من cooling 的  [[magma]] above د earth
				- basalt
				- andesite

- 这 能  也 be classified as
- acidic
		- silica > 66%
		-比如  - granite
- basic
		- silica < 52%
		- 比如  - basalt
					- gabbro
- intermediate 石
		- silica% approx ????
		- 比如  - andecite

- They do not contain any fossils because when the ancient igneous rocks were formed due to cooling and solidification of molten rock materials at the time of the origin of the earth, there was no life on newly born [[earth]] and since the igneous rocks are formed due to cooling and solidification of very hot and molten materials and hence any remains of plants or animals (fossils) are destroyed because of very high [[temperature]].
- Granite, Pegmatite, Gabbro, tuff and Basalt are some examples of it.
