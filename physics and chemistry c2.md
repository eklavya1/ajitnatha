# MIRRORS AND LENS
(1:00 pm)
There are two types- Plane Mirrors and Spherical Mirrors
Plane mirror - A plane mirror is a flat, smooth reflective surface.
Forms behind the mirror.
lateral inversion- Right will appear to be left and vice versa
A plane mirror always forms a virtual image that is upright and of the same shape and size as the object, it is reflecting.
Virtual images are erect and real images are inverted.
Periscope is a device that uses plane mirrors
based upon Total Internal Reflection.

Spherical Mirrors- It is of two types- Concave and Convex Mirror.

Concave Mirror- It is also known as a converging mirror as it converges a parallel beam of light at a point called Focus.
Focus is also the point where the image is formed.

Concave lens- They have similar properties to convex mirrors. They are also known as a diverging lens.
The convex mirror-Diverge beam of light.

Convex lens - have similar properties to concave mirror. They are also known as a converging lens.
A concave mirror is used where we want to magnify the image of any object (Dentist mirror, shaving mirror) And where we want to focus a parallel beam of light. (headlights of the vehicle, Torch)

The convex mirror is used where we want to have a smaller image of a big object- Sunglasses, Rearview mirror of vehicles, Telescope, surveillance mirror.

_Zoom Lens- It is a lens having a variable focal length. (Asked in UPSC 2008)_ #pre 
# Defects of Vision
(1:25pm)
- Myopia -
- This happens due to the elongation of the eyeball.
- Image is formed in front of the retina because of which the person is unable to see distant objects clearly. It is also called nearsightedness
- Correction is a diverging or concave lens.
### Hypermetropia/Farsightedness
 - It is just the opposite of Myopia.
 - Image is formed beyond the retina.
 - Correction is a convex lens/converging lens. Some people may suffer from myopia as well as Hypermetropia. Correction is the bifocal lens.
### Astigmatism
 It is the inability of the human eye to focus on horizontal and vertical lines clearly because of which multiple images are formed.
 Correction is a Cylindrical lens.
### Cataract
 This is the defect of old age people.
 It is the clouding of the lens where the person is unable to distinguish blue colour initially but when clouding becomes opaque, a person may become blind if remain untreated.
 The only treatment is surgery.
 Defect of colour blindness can be remedied by the use of- [ UPSC 2008]-
 a)Concave lens b) convex lens c) Cylindrical lens d)None of the above
 The answer is - D
 # ******************************
# Electric current
(1:40)
Electric current is the flow of charge.
- Ohm's Law is Voltage = Current Ã— Resistance (V=IR)
- Voltage is the measure of power source. It means the higher the voltage higher the current.
- Current is the flow of charge.
- Resistance is a hindrance in the flow of current.
- Resistance is directly proportional to the length of the wire.
- Resistance is inversely proportional to the areas of the cross-section.
- It also depends on the property of the material.
### Conductor
- The conductor allows electricity to pass through them.
- Initially offer less resistance but with time resistance increases and manifests in the form of heat loss.
- Insulator - They offer infinite resistance (no current can pass through them)
- Semiconductor -Initially offer more resistance than conductor but with time resistance declines that is why they have a     lot of applications in electronic industries.
- Superconductor - It offers zero resistance almost. But are not active at room temperature. They require cryogenic (T<0) to function.
- At the nanoscale, silver has shown superconductivity.
### Series and Parallel
Series- Same current passes through the circuit. If any of the appliances becomes non-functional, the current will not flow in the entire circuit.
Parallel - Different current passes through the circuit. In households, parallel connection flows. If any of the devices is gone it does not affect the entire circuit. _related_ [[zettelkasten]] | [[interlinking]] | [[internet]]

### Fuse
- It is a device to save costly appliances in case of voltages and current fluctuations.
- It breaks the path of current.
- It is based upon the heating effect of current.
- Properties of fuse-
	 - Added in series
	 - It has a low Melting point wire.
	 - The resistance of the wire should be very less.

### Heating effect of current
(2:11 pm)
When current is passed through a conductor there is Heating of the appliance due to the resistance.
Here the electric energy is getting converted into heat energy
An alloy of nickel and chromium (Nichrome) is used to intensify the heating. _related_ [[silver surfer]] | [[]] | [[]] 
This property of the current is harnessed in devices like Iron, Geyser, Heater, etc.

### Chemical effect of current
( 2:17 pm)
Solution ( solute+solvent) - Electrolytic and Non-Electrolytic
Electrolytic- When current passes through Electrolytic solution it breaks into ions. This is the chemical effect of current. Example-Salt water.
Non-Electrolytic- Example- Distilled water.
Ion is a charged particle- positive or negative.

### Electroplating
Deposition of one metal on the surface of another metal to save it from rusting etc. with the help of current.
Example-Galvanisation- Zinc plating on iron (zinc-anode; iron- cathode)
Chrome plating- chromium plating on Iron (chromium- anode; iron- cathode)
Imitation jewellery- Gold plating on silver (Gold-anode; silver- cathode)
Anode- It is a positive electrode. It is a sacrificing metal and this metal is to be plated
Cathode- It is a negative electrode.Important/precious metal that needs to be saved.
There will be an Electrolytic solution that is anodic in nature.

### Dynamo
This device converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

### Motor
This device converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.

### Alternative current and Direct Current
- AC - mainly used in transmission lines. It mostly used in household appliances like Refrigerator, AC
- DC - oldest form of current.
- The battery will always give DC.
- Examples of DC current-Laptop, mobile phones, e-vehicles, Plasma TVs, etc.
- Fuel cell in which hydrogen-rich fuel and oxygen are used to generate electricity - If pure hydrogen is used as a fuel, the fuel cell emits heat and water as by-products. (Asked in UPSC 2015)

### Inverter
An inverter is a device that converts DC into AC.

## Magnetic effect of current
(2:55pm)
when current flows through a wire, a magnetic field is developed around it.
If any iron nod or conductor is brought near the magnetic field, it gets magnetised.
when the electric current is stopped the magnetic properties of iron is also gone.
This property of the current is used to develop temporary magnets called electromagnets which have many applications, for example, Electric bells, telephone receivers, etc.
They are used to develop particle accelerators-Cyclotron, Betatron, Large Hadron Collider.

## Electromagnetic Induction
(3:11 pm)
Given by _Michael Faraday_ #personality 
It is the production of voltage or current in changing magnetic field.
Application- wireless charging, Eddy current
Eddy currents are loops of induced current in a conductor in changing magnetic field.
These current are often seen as heat loss but have applications in Induction cookware, Melting of metals, Train braking mechanism, etc.
Galvanometer- Device to detect current.
Ammeter- Device to measure current.
# ******************************
# Latent Heat
(3:15 pm)
Latent heat is the amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance during a phase change without changing the temperature.
Application- steam can burn more severely than boiling water because steam is having additional 540 calories with it in the form of latent heat.
Anything becomes cool if kept in the vicinity of ice.
Food gets cooked even after putting the flame as steam while condensing releases 540 calories in the food.

# Abnormal behaviour of Water
Water is having a maximum density at 4 degrees Celcius.
The density of ice is less than the density of water (due to hydrogen bonding)
The density of water is not maximum in solid-state i.e. 0Â°C
- When water is heated from 0Â°C to 10Â°C its volume-first decreases and then increases.
- The surface of a lake is frozen in severe winter, but the water is at the bottom is still liquid. The reason is- The density of water is maximum at 4Â°C

# Cohesive and adhesive force
(3:37 pm)
Cohesive Force- It is an intermolecular attractive force between two similar sets of molecules. Example- force acting Among the water molecules
Adhesive force - An attractive force between two dissimilar sets of molecules. Example- Make up on the face

# Surface Tension
Surface Tension is the property of the surface of a liquid to resist an external force caused due to cohesive force.
Here the surface of water behaves as an elastic.
Application- Water strider, Urine test, Jaundice test, etc.
Capillarity is caused due to surface tension.
If there were no phenomenon of capillarity then[Asked in UPSC 2012]
	 It would be difficult to use a kerosene lamp
	 the blotting paper would fail to function
	 the big trees that we see around would not have grown on the earth
