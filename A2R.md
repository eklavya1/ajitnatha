The UN Climate Resilience Initiative: **Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape** (A2R) is a global multi-stakeholder initiative that strengthens climate resilience for vulnerable countries and
people.
It forges linkages between climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable development, in order to accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction for delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals.
A2R promotes three key capacities as a common frame for climate resilience in the UN System and for its partners. By strengthening these three capacities, Partners can better
**understand and manage climate risks and hazards -**
Anticipate: Capacity to better anticipate and act on climate hazards and stresses through early warning and early action.
Absorb: Capacity to absorb shocks and stresses by increasing access to climate risk insurance and social protection systems.
Reshape: Capacity to reshape development pathways by transforming economies to reduce risks and root causes of vulnerabilities and support the sound management of physical infrastructure and ecosystems to foster climate resilience.
