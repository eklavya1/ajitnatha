An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons & is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally "water fearing") & lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally "fat loving"). Oils are usually flammable & surface active. Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.

The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, & uses. Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, & may be volatile or non-volatile. They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel (e.g., heating oil), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), lubrication (e.g. motor oil), & the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, & other materials. Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies & rituals as purifying agents.
