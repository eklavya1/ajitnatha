- when you borrow money from a bank, be it for purchasing a house, car or for business purposes, interest is levied based on certain methodologies approved by the reserve bank of india ([[rbi]]).
- at present, banks use [[marginal cost of funds based lending rate]] (mclr) to arrive at their lending rate.
- prior to this, it was the [[base rate]] method and the benchmark [[prime lending rate]] (bplr).
- these were all internal benchmarks.
- banks have been allowed to use rbi's policy rate among other market-driven options to calculate lending rates.
