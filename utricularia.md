Utricularia belong to the family Lentibulariaceae.
They are insectivorous plants.
Insectivorous plants are the plants that derive their nutrition by feeding on insects and other organisms.
Insect trapping mechanism of Utricularia or Bladderworts
The Bladderworts generally inhabit freshwater wetlands and waterlogged areas.
Some species are associated with moist moss-covered rock surfaces and damp soils during rains.
Utricularia in its bladders mouth has sensitive bristles or hairs.
When an insect happens to contact these hairs the door opens, carrying the insect into the bladder along with a little current of water.
The door is shut when water fills the bladder, the enzymes produced by the inner wall of the bladder digest the insect.
