Horticulture is the branch of agriculture concerned with intensively cultured plants directly used by man for food, medicinal purposes, and aesthetic gratification.
In simpler words, it is the cultivation, production, and sale of vegetables, fruits, flowers, herbs, ornamental or exotic plants.
The term Horticulture is derived from the Latin words hortus (garden) and cult√ºra (cultivation).
