The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Act, 2020 amends the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010.
o The Act regulates the acceptance and utilisation of foreign contributions by individuals, associations and companies.
o Foreign contribution is the donation or transfer of any currency, security or article (of beyond a specified value) by a foreign source.
Prohibition to accept foreign contribution: Under the Act, certain persons are prohibited to accept any foreign contribution.
o These include election candidates, editor or publisher of a newspaper, judges, government servants, members of any legislature, and political parties, among others.
o The Act adds public servants (as defined under the Indian Penal Code) to this list.
Transfer of foreign contribution: The Act prohibits the transfer of foreign contribution to any other person. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
