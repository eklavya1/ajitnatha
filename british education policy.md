british took a keen interest in introducing english language in india. they had many reasons for doing so. educating indians in english language was a part of their strategy. it was not in interest of indians.
indians would be ready to work as clerks on low wages while for same work british would demand much higher wages.
this would reduce expenditure on administration. it was also expected to create a class of indians who were loyal to british & were not able to relate to other indians.
this class of indians would be taught to appreciate culture & opinion of british.
in addition, they would also help to increase market for british goods.
they wanted to use education as a means to strengthen their political authority in country. they assumed that a few educated indians would spread english culture to masses & that they would be able to rule through this class of educated indians.
british gave jobs to only those indians who knew english thereby compelling many indians to go in for english education. education soon became a monopoly of rich & city dwellers.
british parliament issued charter act of 1813 by which a sum of rupees 1 lakh was sanctioned for promoting westem sciences in india.
though british followed a half-hearted education policy in india, english language & westem ideas also had some positive impacts on society.
spread of english language & westem education helped indians to adopt a modern, rational, democratic, liberal, & patriotic outlook.
western thinkers like max mueller & annie besant encouraged vemacular languages & literary works to instill a sense of pride in indian heritage & culture. it enabled indians to revive india's cultural past.
