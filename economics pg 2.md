#wo_de gandhi's trusteeship theory fails here -  from the ter 70 years of independence, influential people try their best to not let go of their property and manipulate law in their favor. political and social will at grassroot level (as in [[kerala]] is required for such actions)
## Challenges faced in the abolition of Zamindari
(01:05:00 PM)
1. Long delays in Legislations
In 1948, Central Govt passed a Model Law.
Gave guidelines to states to pass the legislation 1949.
But States took a long time around 8 to 10 years to pass the abolition Laws.
This long delay gave time to Zamindars to manipulate the land records like Benami Transactions, Re-Classification of lands, etc
2. Right to Property:
Abolition of Zamindari Laws was challenged multiple times giving more time to manipulate
3. Exploited the Loopholes in the Laws: 
Like the term "Personal Cultivation " was vaguely defined.
4. Zamindar became the "New Age Landlords".
5. Only two states Karnataka & West Bengal passed Land ceiling laws, so it lead to further consolidation of the lands and power with the zamindars n the rest of the states.
6. Clause of Voluntary Surrender:
It was misused by the powerful and used by them to force the tenants to surrender ownership!
7. Poorly updated and Incomplete land records:
It led to the non-tracking of the records.

## Tenancy Reforms
(01:28:00 PM)
Classification of Tenants:
A. Superior Tenants: 
They are occupational tenants who have almost the same rights as the owner.
They can sell, mortgage, or rent out the land.
Their rights over the land are secure and they can not be evicted against their will.
B. Inferior Tenants:
They are also called tenants at will.
They have limited rights over the land and can be evicted by the owners.
C. Sub-Tenants:
They have leased in the land from the other tenants and can be evicted easily.
D. Share Croppers:
They cultivate other person's land for a share in return they have no rights whatsoever on the land.
Given the context of high rents, lack of security of tenure, and absence of ownership rights to the tenants the state governments passed legislation for the regulation of tenancy in the following ways:
1. States like Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, MP, and UP banned leasing out of agricultural land except for certain categories of the landowners(differently-abled, armed forces, etc.)
2. States like Kerala and H& K banned agricultural tenancy without any exception.
3. States like Punjab, Haryana, and Gujarat allowed tenancy and also gave the right of purchase of the land to the tenants after continuous possession for a few years.
4. States like Tamil, Nadu, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, etc did not band tenancy but regulated it through legislation.
Reforms took:
1. Fixing rents: The central govt's model law said that the upper limit of the rent should be 20 to 25% of the value of the produce.
On average states kept rent at 33%. (Punjab kept it at 40%, TN 20 to 25%, Assam at 25%.
But this failed because:
a. There were no written agreements of the tenancy.
b. Assessement of crop values.
c. The lack of awareness among the tenants.
d. Lack of adequate grievance redressal.
2. Security of Tenure:
The central govt passed Model Law on Security Law,1951. which contained things like:
It defined tenants, owners, etc.
It defined conditions under which the tenants can be removed and the owner can resume cultivation. 
On what % the cultivation by owner can be resumed.
Conditions under which tenants can surrender.
Compensation to be paid in case of eviction.
It failed because:
a. Oral deeds. No written records.
b. The exploitation of Resumption of cultivation by owners clause.
c. Voluntary surrender was not voluntary but forced.
d. Compensation was not fixed and not paid.
e. No adequate grievance redressal.
d. Definition of tenants was narrowly defined missed out on many types of tenants like sharecroppers.
3. Ownership Rights:
Central Govt law said 12 years of continuous tenancy then tenants should have the right to buy the land or ownership rights.
Punjab & Haryana gave 6 years.
Kerala & West Bengal were most successful because:
Socialist ideology of governments.
very strong local self-government.
Reason for failure:
Oral deeds no written agreements.
The period of tenancy was shortened.
Lack of resources to buy.
Lack of Willingness to buy or poor motivation to buy due to muscle power of the owners.
Lack of adequate and updated land records.
Implications of above reforms in Tenancy:
a. Massive eviction of tenants.
b. Dysfunctional tenancy market.: It led to the shifting of the tenancy underground market, so more exploitation. (High rents, shortened tenancy period, etc)
c. Land kept following because the owners did not want to lose ownership.
To reform all these the NITI Ayog brought the Model Tenancy Act, 2017.

## Land Ceiling Reform
(03:01:00 PM)
Land Ceiling is rationing of the land or fixing the upper limit for the land ownership.
Why it should be done?
a. Distributive justice: To achieve DPSPs. To prevent concentration of resources in few hands.
b. Providing income-generating assets ie to reduce inequalities.
c. Hanumantha Rao: Smaller lands are more efficient in the Indian socio-economic context. It will generate more employment.
d. Inclusive Growth ie Participative development.
Why it should not be done?
a. Less Productive as there is no benefit of economies of scale.
b. Disincentivizing investments so there will be no mechanization and R&D.
c. smaller farmers will be doing subsistence farming as they have no resources and the larger ones can not expand.
d. disguised employment.
e. Fragmentation of lands leads to more boundary disputes.
Land Ceiling Reforms:
A. From1960s to 1972:
1. Unit of Application: Most states mad it on an individual basis, not on a family basis.
It failed because the land was distributed among the family members so no surplus.
2. A very high ceiling was kept.
3. Many exemptions like plantations, religious purposes, etc. 
4. Priority for distribution: 
5. Compensation to be paid.
These reforms were failure so there was a conference of CMs in 1972 which give the following recommendations:
The unit should be family.
Rationalize the upper limit. (18 acres for irrigated land and 54 acres for non irrigated land).
Reduce exemptions.
Place these laws in the 9th schedule.
Retrospective application of these laws.
Even after these recommendations, the reforms failed because:
a. Still upper limit was high so there was very little surplus.
b. Corruption at the local level using the exemptions got the land classified under various heads like religious or charitable purposes.
c. Benami transactions still continued so surplus was reduced.
d. The quality of land distributed was very poor and the resources were limited with the poor who received these lands.
e. Though on paper lands were given, on the ground, people could not get the actual possession due to the muscle power of landlords.
f. Lack of updated and complete land records.
Only 2% of the cultivable land was collected as surplus and redistributed.
