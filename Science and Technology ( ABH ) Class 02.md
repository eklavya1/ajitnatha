Doubts from the previous class were resolved (1:05 PM)

Nuclear fusion (1:12 PM)
- ted talk on [[nuclear fusion]] - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-LCfx9v4YQ&t=345s
- When 2 or more lighter nuclei are combined together to form a heavier nucleus.
- This process is called nuclear fusion.
- It is responsible for energy production in stars.
- [[tokamak]] - it is a device used to have nuclear fusion.
- We are trying to use nuclear fusion to produce energy on a commercial scale on the earth. _related_ [[passengers movie]] | [[]] | [[]] 
- However, success has been very limited.
- Eg-  ([[ITER international thermonuclear experimental reactor]] )
- India is a member, has a tokamak device, and aims to produce 500 MW of fusion-based energy.
- It wants to achieve deuterium, tritium fusion and sustain it for a long duration through internal heating. (hydrogen cannot be fused because it's impossible, so we are using isotopes)
- However, the biggest challenge is to maintain the initial condition of high temperature for a long duration to sustain fusion.
- If this reaction becomes successful, it will be a great achievement for the entire humanity because Nuclear fusion does not emit any greenhouse gases.
- We can produce abundant energy compared to other sources.
- Raw material for fusion is deuterium which is easily available and tritium which can be easily produced in labs.
- Fusion also does not produce long-lived radioactive waste.
- There is no risk of a meltdown in a Tokamak fusion device.

## Applications of nuclear technology
(1:44 PM)
- In agriculture
- Plant mutation breeding- exposing the seeds or cutting a plant with gamma rays cause mutations that can be desirable.
- Eg- crops with resistance to droughts and salinity.
- Fertilizer [[efficiency]] - labeling fertilizer with isotopes provides means to determine how much has been taken up by the plants.
- Insect control - Radiation is used to control insect population via sterile insect technique.
- It involves the sterilization of a large population of insects through e-radiation and introducing them back to the natural population.
- Food processing- exposing foodstuff to gamma rays, x-rays, or electron beams to kill bacteria that can cause food-borne disease. It also enhances the shelf life of food.

## Nuclear technology in medicine
(2:09 PM)
- Diagnosis- nuclear medicines containing radiotracers are injected into the bloodstream which can provide images of the inside of the body that cannot be obtained using other imaging procedures. This has the potential to detect diseases in the early stages.
- External beam therapy- For controlling or eliminating cancerous growth.
- Generally, Cobalt 60 is used for this therapy.
- Advanced cancer treatment which is known as Brachytherapy
- [[Cesium]] 137 and [[Iridium]] 192 are used in the therapy.
- It is an advanced cancer treatment where a high radiation dose is given to the tumor while reducing the radiation exposure in the surrounding healthy tissues.
- Radiation sterilization of health care products to kill microorganisms.
- Eg- disposable syringes, cotton dressing, drugs, etc.

## Applications in Industry
- Radioisotopes are used by manufacturers as tracers to monitor fluid flow and filtration detect leaks as well as it is possible to study wide range of materials.
- Water de-salinization: energy from nuclear reactions is used to ensure no greenhouse gas is occurring.
- Carbon dating- naturally occurring carbon isotopes such as carbon 14 is of vital importance in determining the age of rocks and other minerals.

## Nanotechnology
(2:43 PM)
- Nanotechnology is the synthesis and manipulation of nanomaterials which are of the dimension of 1 to 100 nanometers.
- Working at the nanoscale enables scientists to understand and utilize the unique physical, chemical, mechanical and optical properties of materials that occur at this scale.
- Properties of material at the nanoscale are very different from properties at the macro scale.
- This happens because of the following reasons:
- At the nanoscale, quantum effects dominate.

## Basic postulates of quantum mechanisms
(3:17 PM)
- Dual nature - wave-particle duality
- Principle of uncertainty - we have not found any exception as of now.
- In Quantum mechanics, one can only deal with probabilities not rather than certainty.

Changes:
- The surface area of Nanomaterial increases, compared to bulk materials which make them highly reactive.
- The movement is electrons are confined in Nanomaterials.
- Nanomaterial also exhibits the properties of self-assembly.

## Synthesis of Nano Material
(3:29 PM)
- There are 2 approaches for the synthesis of Nanomaterial.
- The top-down approach reduces a large piece of material down to the nanoscale.
- Bottom-up approach- it creates products by building them from the atomic and molecular components.

## Applications of nanotechnology
(3:36 PM)

- using nanotechnology materials can effectively be made stronger, lighter, more durable, more reactive among many other traits.
- These have applications in everyday lives such as:
- Addition of nanomaterials to certain fabrics- resisting wrinkling as well as bacterial growth.
- In everyday material and processes
- Nano screens, eyeglasses, camera displays, windows can make them water and dust repellant.
- Lightweight but stronger material can be used in automobiles as well as airplanes and spacecrafts which could lead to significant fuel saving.
- Nanomaterials are added to surf detergents and sunscreen lotions to make them more effective.
## Applications in health care
- (3:41 PM)
- Targeted drug delivery
- Researchers are working on delivering medication directly to diseased cells thus minimizing the risk of damage to healthy tissue.
- This has huge potential in cancer treatment.
- In tissue engineering, Nanotechnology has immense applications.
- Researchers are looking for ways to grow complex tissues with the goal of one-day growing human organs for transplant.
- Better imaging and diagnostic tools pave the way for early diagnosis and more individualized treatment options.
- Some nanomaterials have the potential to kill superbugs and thus control anti-microbial resistance.
- Applications in energy
- Nanotechnology improves the efficiency of fuel production from raw petroleum through better catalysis.
- Carbon nanotubes and other nanomembranes are being used to separate carbon dioxide from power plant exhaust.
- Carbon nanotube has the potential to solve the hydrogen storage challenge.
- Application in environmental remediation
- Nanomembranes are highly effective in treating water impurities
- Nano technology enabled sensors and detect and identify chemical and biological agents in the air and soil with much higher sensitivity
