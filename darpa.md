- the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) is a research and development agency of the united states department of defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.originally known as the advanced research projects agency (arpa), the agency was created on february 7, [[1958]], by president dwight d. eisenhower in response to the soviet launching of sputnik 1 in 1957. by collaborating with academia, industry, and government partners, darpa formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate u.s. military requirements.the economist has called darpa the agency "that shaped the modern world," and pointed out that "modernaâ€™s covid-19 vaccine sits alongside weather satellites, gps, drones, stealth technology, voice interfaces, the personal computer and the internet on the list of innovations for which darpa can claim at least partial credit."   its track record of success has inspired governments around the world to launch similar research and development agencies.darpa is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior department of defense management. darpa comprises approximately 220 government employees in six technical offices, including nearly 100 program managers, who together oversee about 250 research and development programs.the name of the organization first changed from its founding name, arpa, to darpa, in march 1972, changing back to arpa in february 1993, then reverted to darpa in march 1996.the agency's current director, appointed in march 2021, is stefanie tompkins.
