The day that the Earth's North Pole is tilted closest to the sun is called the [[summer solstice]].
This is the longest day (most daylight hours) of the year for people living in the northern hemisphere. It is also the day that the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky.

The [[winter solstice]], or the shortest day of the year, happens when the Earth's the North Pole is tilted farthest from the Sun.
