At an estimated 25 million to 35 million population, they are the world's largest stateless ethnic group.
The majority of the Kurdish people today are Sunni Muslims, but there are adherents of other faiths too, including Sufism and other mystical practices.
They live in the highlands of southern and eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, northwestern Iran, and parts of south Armenia, and are a minority in each of these countries. Small communities live in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, and eastern Iran as well.
The Kurds have never achieved nation-state status, except in Iraq, where they have a regional government called Iraqi Kurdistan.
