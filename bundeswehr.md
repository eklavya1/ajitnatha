the bundeswehr (german: [ˈbʊndəsˌveːɐ̯] (listen), meaning literally: federal defence) bao is the *armed forces* of the federal republic of [[germany]]. the bundeswehr is divided into a military part (armed forces or stre itkräfte) and a civil part, the military part consisting of the german army, the german navy, the german air force, the joint support service, the joint medical service, and the cyber and information domain service.

as of 28 february 2022, the bundeswehr had a strength of 183,638 active-duty military personnel and 81,318 civilians, placing it among the 30 largest military forces in the world, and making it the second largest in the european union behind france. in addition, the bundeswehr has approximately 30,050 reserve personnel (2020). with german military expenditures at $56.0 billion, the bundeswehr is the seventh highest-funded military in the world, though military expenditures remain relatively average at 1.3% of national gdp, well below the (non-binding) nato target of 2%. germany is aiming to expand the bundeswehr to around 203,000 soldiers by 2025 to better cope with increasing responsibilities.on the 27th of february 2022, following concerns from the 2022 russian invasion of ukraine, germany announced a major shift in policy, pledging a €100 billion special fund for the bundeswehr - to remedy years of underinvestment - along with raising the budget to above 2% gdp.
