	- Abwab is the _plural form of the Arabic term bab_ which means a door, a section, a chapter, a title.
	- In Mughal India all temporary and circumstantial taxes and impositions levied by the government over and above regular taxes were called abwabs.
	- More specifically, abwab meaning all irregular impositions on raiyats above the established assessment of land in the pargana. Land tax was established by Todar Mal after a field-to-field survey. The standard of rent thus established has hardly been changed since 1582. To meet unforeseen exigencies, the government used to levy temporary taxes, cesses, and imposts, all collectively known as abwab. During nawabi period a variety of abwabs were imposed on zamindars, who conveniently transferred them on to their raiyats. In addition to zamindari abwabs, there were also many other abwabs, which were imposed by faujdars and kotwals.
