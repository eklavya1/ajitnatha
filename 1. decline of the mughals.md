India in the 1750s saw the decline of the Mughal Empire and the emergence of Successor States.
Until 1707, almost the whole of India was under the direct control of the Mughals.
The Mughal rulers who came to power after the death of Aurangzeb (1707), are known as the later Mughals.
Later Mughals were weak and couldn't hold the vast Mughal empire together. The decline of the Mughal Empire led to the rise of many autonomous states or kingdoms.
## Bahadur Shah (1707-1712)
• After Aurangazeb died in 1707, his eldest son Bahadur Shah became the emperor following a succession war with his brothers.
• He was 65 when he ascended the throne.
• In the beginning, he tried to exercise more control over Amber and Marwar, but in the end, ended up giving them high mansabs.
• He also granted the Marathas the sardeshmukhi of Deccan but failed to give them the chauth. Thus, the Marathas were not fully satisfied.
• He also tried to pacify the Sikhs by giving Guru Gobind Singh high mansabs. But later, he also crushed a rebellion by Banda Bahadur, who was Gobind Singh's successor.
• He died in 1712, and the empire plunged into rebellion once again.
## Jahandar Shah (1712-1713)
• It was now that the era of kingmakers in the history of India started.
• One of Bahadur Shah's less able sons, Jahandar Shah won the throne with the help and support of Zulfiqar Khan, the most powerful noble of the time.
• The prince was the least interested in administration and it passed into the hands of Zulfiqar. His policies, however, were, clever and progressive.
