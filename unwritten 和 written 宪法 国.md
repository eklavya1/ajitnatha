• A constitution is an aggregate of the fundamental principles and laws of a social group or nation or a state that act as a basis for governance in a country.
 • A constitution is crucial as it determines the control and distribution of powers, primary organs of the state, functions and organisations of the government, and the citizens’ duties and rights.
 • There are two fundamental types of Constitution
 ◦ Written Constitution
 ▪️ A Written Constitution is defined as a Constitution that has been meticulously and systematically embodied and written in a single document.  
 ▪️ The powers of the executive, legislative and judicial branches are more clearly defined than the unwritten one which often prevents ambiguity, uncertainty, and possible conflict between the three pillars of government. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
 ◦ Unwritten Constitution
 ▪️ An Unwritten Constitution is defined as the Constitution devoid of laws or provisions set in writing but is documented despite not being incorporated in a single book.
 ▪️ The main advantage is that these types of constitutions are dynamic, flexible, and more amenable to constitutional reform. Hence, statement 1 is correct.  
 ▪️ The flexible nature of uncodified constitutions tends to be subject to multiple interpretations.
 ▪️ The UK along with New Zealand and Israel are the only three countries in the world to have an uncodified or ‘unwritten’ constitution.
