ratio decidendi (latin plural rationes decidendi) is a latin phrase meaning "the reason" or "the *rationale for the decision*". the ratio decidendi is "the point in a case that determines the judgement" or "the principle that the case establishes".in other words, ratio decidendi is a legal rule derived from, and consistent with, those parts of legal reasoning within a judgment on which the outcome of the case depends.

it is a legal phrase which refers to the legal, moral, political and social principles used by a court to compose the rationale of a particular judgment. unlike obiter dicta, the ratio decidendi is, as a general rule, binding on courts of lower and later jurisdiction—through the doctrine of stare decisis. certain courts are able to overrule decisions of a court of coordinate jurisdiction. however, out of interests of judicial comity, they generally try to follow coordinate rationes.

the process of determining the ratio decidendi is a correctly thought analysis of what the court actually decided—essentially, based on the legal points about which the parties in the case actually fought. all other statements about the law in the text of a court opinion—all pronouncements that do not form a part of the court's rulings on the issues actually decided in that particular case (whether they are correct statements of law or not)—are obiter dicta, and are not rules for which that particular case stands.
