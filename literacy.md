- literacy in its broadest sense describes "particular ways of thinking about and doing reading and writing" with the purpose of understanding or expressing thoughts or ideas in written form in some specific context of use. in other words, humans in literate societies have sets of practices for producing and consuming writing, and they also have beliefs about these practices.  reading, in this view, is always reading something for some purpose; writing is always writing something for someone for some particular ends. beliefs about reading and writing and its value for society and for the individual always influence the ways literacy is taught, learned, and practiced over the lifespan.

some researchers suggest that the history of interest in the concept of “literacy” can be divided into two periods. firstly is the period before 1950, when literacy was understood solely as alphabetical literacy (word and letter recognition). secondly is the period after 1950, when literacy slowly began to be considered as a wider concept and process, including the social and cultural aspects of reading and writing, and functional literacy (dijanošić, 2009).
