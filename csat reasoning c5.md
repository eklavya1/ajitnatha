CALENDAR MONTHS #pneumonic _JFMAMJ JASOND_

	note in leap year section we need the quotient not the remainder
- leap - last 2 digit of the year / 4
	- if divisible then leap yr otherwise not
- when date is asked, assume it to be 1 then solve to get F.O.D. then use common sense to move from 1st date to the one asked in question to calculate the day

NOTE - when "if" is given in the question then first check to find the integrity of the statement
NOTE - for the century code , just tally the first two numbers of the year and look at that exact number (don't use your head and think that 2021 means 21st century or 1924 means 20 century, doesn't work here ! ) ex-
	- 1920's century code
		- first 2 digits = 19
		- look for the corresponding value for 19 (which is 0 btw)
NOTE - 
	in the leap year value (last value in the formula), you have to take the quotient
	while in the R.H.S you need remainder
