## mansabdari system
- akbar established this system. it was a part of mughal bureacracy. 
- mansab is a “position” or office.
- mansabdar is holder of office.
- since it was a bureaucratic system, there was a hierarchical system.
- 
- each mansabdar had a rank.
- it was decided on basis of zat & sawar
- zat was personal rank.
- sawar referred to number of horsemen a mansabdar needs to maintain.
- therefore, mansabdars had a dual role (civil & military).
- salary of mansabdars was provided in cash or in jagirs
- naqdi mansabdar- salary was paid in cash
- jagirdars were assigned a land, from which a mansabdar used to collect revenue.
- however, some other local people were also given jagirs. (therefore, they were not mansabdars)
- 
### types of jagirs
- 
- tankha jagir- it was given for temporary tenure.
- watan jagir- it was given permanently.
- another type of land revenue was khalisa land (royal land): entire revenue goes to royal treasury.
- 1/5th of total land was royal land.
- 4/5th of land was given as jagirs.
- power of king: appointment & removal of mansabdars
- relationship b/w king & mansabdars: personal relationship based on loyalty to king. mansabdar gets jagirdari & gives loyalty & army to king.
- impersonal loyalty could not develop in mansabdari system & later if mansabdars didn’t get jagirs they become disloyal.
- 
### land revenue flow
- there are ground-level functionaries like primary zamindars, intermediary zamindars (who were not owners of land) who used to pass revenue to jagirdars.
- zamindars used to work for a commission which cn be in form of “nankar” land i.e. revenue free land (on some units, land revenue cn be skipped).
- 
### peasants are divided into:
- medium landowner
- small landowner
- both of categories used to pay tax are k/a land revenue.
- tenants (they it'll pay rent to actual owners).
- tenants are of 2 types:
- khud kasht: they had been cultivating land for generations. they had occupancy rights.
- pahi kasht: landless peasants, no occupancy rights. they it'll move from place to place where they may get work.
- 
## ijaradars (revenue farmers)
- they are not farmers or cultivators
- they have a similar function as zamindars ie role of revenue collection
- they get role by action of land revenue collection right by state.
- they were included in category of “upstarts” (they had got power newly, as earlier they didn’t have power).
- this system was introduced by jahandar shah in bengal & hyderabad.
- it was used when state wants to maximize land revenue or when land revenue collection fails. eg- drought
