Energy crops used in biofuel production are - Jatropha, Pongamia, [[wheat]], [[corn]], [[sugarcane]], etc.
Biofuel is in great demand these days because it burns cleaner than fossil fuels, and releases fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the [[atmosphere]].
Biofuel is categorized into two types - Bio-alcohol and Bio-diesel.
Bio-diesel - vegetable oils and animal fats are treated with alcohol and converted to biodiesel.

Any hydrocarbon fuel i.e. Solid, Liquid, or Gas, that is produced from an organic matter which may be living or once-living material, in a short period of time is considered a biofuel.
Biofuels may be solid, liquid, or gaseous in nature.
	• Solid: Wood, dried plant material, and manure
	• Liquid: Bioethanol and Biodiesel
	• Gaseous: Biogas
## First-generation Biofuels
• First Generation biofuels are produced directly from food crops by abstracting the oils for use in biodiesel or producing bioethanol through conventional methods like fermentation.
• Crops such as wheat corn, and sugar are the most widely used feedstock for bioethanol while rapeseed oil has proved a very effective crop for use in biodiesel.
## Second-generation Biofuels
• These are produced from non-food crops or portions of food crops that are not edible and considered as wastes, e.g. stems, rice husks, jatropba, wood chips, and fruit skins and peeling.
• Thermochemical reactions or biochemical conversion process is used for producing such fuels.
• Examples include cellulose ethanol, biodiesel.
## Third generation Biofuels
• These are produced from micro-organisms like algae:
• Example- Butanol
## Fourth-generation Biofuels
• In the production of these fuels, crops that are genetically engineered to take in high amounts of carbon are grown and harvested as biomass.
• The crops are then converted into fuel using second-generation techniques.
