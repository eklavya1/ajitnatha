- brief recap

- (1:38 pm) exchange rate continues...

## movements in currency (exchange rate)
- appreciation / depreciation = it is a phenomenon in a floating exchange rate system that is an adjustment in exchange rate that takes place due to market forces
- revaluation / devaluation = revaluation or devaluation is a feature of a fixed exchange rate system that is where govt decides exchange rate & allows currency to become costlier or cheaper in units of foreign currency

## (1:50 pm) convertibility of rupee:
- it refers to ease with which domestic currency can be converted to fostering currency. if there are restrictions wrt conversion, then we say that rupee is only partially convertible.
- if conversion is allowed without restrictions that are freely, then we say that currency is fully convertible
- presently rupee is fully convertible for transactions on current account whereas partially convertible for transactions on capital account.
- tarapore committee has recommended a few steps to be taken before full convertibility of rupee is allowed. these include-
- a) reduction on fiscal deficit, b) improvement of health of banking system, c) controlling inflation, d) adequate forex reserves, etc. (refer to printed material, refer slides for an alternate view on convertibility of rupee)

## india's balance of payment
- (explained through graphs in slides) (2:13 pm)
- 2:38 pm break / resumed at 3:00 pm

## controlling current account deficit:
- [[current account deficit]]
### causes of deficit:
- demand-side = strong domestic growth, weak foreign growth, recession abroad, strong exchange rate, etc.
- supply side = low investment, low productivity, high relative inflation, high labor cost, poor quality of exports, etc.
- how to address deficit?
- identify cause & recognize side-effect
- central reason = higher imports than export
1. cause = high income at home / policy = demand reduction
- action = contractionary fiscal or monetary policy
- consequence = reduction in output, employment, business confidence
2. cause = cheaper imports / policy = impose tariffs, quotas
- consequences = retaliation, costly, inflationary, wto violation, higher prices for consumers
3. cause = inefficiency, supply-side / policy = supply-side policy - investment
- consequence = long term nature, costly, no guarantee of success
4. cause = strong currency (exchange rate) making exports uncompetitive / policy = devaluation of er, domestic subsidies to exports
- consequences = currency war, imports costlier, elasticity of imports & exports changes wrt currency (j curve effect)

## effect of exchange rate (er) on current account deficit:
(4:18 pm)
- exchange rates affect cost of imports & exports. when er appreciates (from 1$ = 50 rupees to 1$ = 50 rupees), it becomes cheaper to import, whereas exports become costly.
- on other hand when er depreciates (that is from 1$ = 50 rupees to 1$ = 60 rupees), it becomes costly to import whereas exports become cheaper.
- however, value of total imports & total exports depends on number of imports & exports. quantity itself depends on price. however, whether total value of imports or exports (p.q = price x qty) increases or decreases depends on sensitivity of qty to price, that is, price elasticity of demand.
## j-curve effect:
- [[j-curve effect]]
- we assume that exports & imports are largely inelastic in short term & therefore value of imports due to depreciating currency increases & value of exports decreases, causing an initial worsening of cad, on other hand after a period of time qty adjusts to new prices & therefore value of imports decreases a value of exports increases, causing an improvement in cad.
