- International Date Line, also called Date Line, an imaginary line extending between the North Pole and the South Pole and arbitrarily demarcating each calendar day from the next. It corresponds along most of its length to the 180th meridian of [[longitude]] but deviates eastward through the Bering [[Strait]] to avoid dividing Siberia and then deviates westward to include the Aleutian Islands with Alaska. South of the [[Equator]], another eastward deviation allows certain [[island]] groups to have the same day as [[New Zealand]]. It is not a straight line, but a zig-zag line 
- On crossing it from east to west, a day is lost. Like if a traveller starts from Kyoto (Japan) towards California (America) on 1st January 2019, on crossing International Date Line the date will be 31st December 2018. Similarly, on crossing it from west to east, a day is gained.
- . A traveller crossing the date line from east to west loses a day. A traveller crossing the date line from west to east gains a day.
- When one crosses IDL, there is only change of date not time, as there is no change in [[time zone]].
- IDL in the mid-Pacific deviates from normal 180 degree meridian at the Bering [[Strait]], Fiji, Tonga and other islands to prevent confusion of day and date in some of the island groups that are cut through by the meridian. Otherwise the same [[island]] will have two different dates.
- Countries having large longitudinal spread can adopt several time zones. Like [[mod his 26|Russia]] which extends through almost 1650 of latitude is divided into eleven time zones. Similarly, USA and Canada are divided into five time zones.
- Countries with large latitudinal spread but limited longitudinal spread [[may]] adopt single [[time zone]]. Like India, which spreads across almost 300 [[latitude]] has adopted a single [[time zone]]. It has adopted 82.50 east for the standard time which is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time.
