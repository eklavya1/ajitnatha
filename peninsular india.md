Rising from the height of 150 m above the river plains up to an elevation of 600-900 m is the irregular triangle known as the Peninsular plateau.
Delhi ridge in the northwest (extension of Aravalis), the Rajmahal Hills in the east, Gir range in the west and the Cardamom Hills in the south constitute the outer extent of the Peninsular plateau. However, an extension of this is also seen in the northeast, in the form of the Shillong and Karbi-Anglong plateau.
Peninsular India is made up of a series of Patland plateaus such as the Hazaribagh plateau, the Palamu plateau, the Ranchi plateau, the Malwa plateau, the Coimbatore plateau and the Karnataka plateau, etc.
This is one of the oldest and the most stable landmass of India.
The general elevation of the plateau is from the west to the east, which is also proved by the pattern of the flow of rivers.

Three major geological events in the distant past have shaped the present drainage systems of Peninsular India:
1. Subsidence of the western flank of the Peninsula led to its submergence below the sea during the early tertiary period. Generally, it has disturbed the symmetrical plan of the river on either side of the original watershed.
2. The upheaval of the Himalayas
When the northem flank of the Peninsular block was subjected to subsidence and the consequent trough faulting.
The Narmada and The Tapi flow through faults and fill the original cracks with their detritus materials. Hence, there is a lack of alluvial and deltaic deposits in these rivers.
3. Slight tilting of the Peninsular block from northwest to the southeastern direction
It gave orientation to the entire drainage system towards the [[Bay of Bengal]] during the same period.
