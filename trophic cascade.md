trophic cascades are powerful indirect interactions that can control entire ecosystems.
trophic cascades occur when predators limit density and/or behaviour of their prey & thereby enhance survival of next lower trophic level.
predators eat prey.
by so doing, predators can impact both prey abundance & behaviour (e.g., prey get scared when predators are around & hide or move away).
when impact of a predator on its prey's ecology trickles down on more feeding levels to affect density and/or behaviour of prey's prey, ecologists term this interaction a feeding, or trophic cascade.
in this situation, by controlling densities and/or behaviour of their prey, predators indirectly benefit & increase abundance of their prey's prey.
trophic cascades by definition must occur across a minimum of 3 feeding levels. indeed, this is how they most commonly occur, although evidence of 4- & 5-level trophic cascades have been shown in nature, but are far less common
