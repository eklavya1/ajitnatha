Parliamentary torm of government in India
## Nominal and Real Executives
• The President is the nominal executive (de jure executive or titular executive) while the Prime Minister is the real executive (de tacto executive).
• Thus, the President is head of the State, while the Prime Minister is head of the government. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
• Article 74 provides tor a council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister to aid and advise the President in the exercise of his functions. The advice so tendered is binding on the President
## Majority Party Rule
• The political party which secures majority seats in the Lok Sabha forms the government
• The leader of that party is appointed as the Prime Minister by the President; other ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the prime minister.
• However, when no single party gets the majority, a coalition of parties may be invited by the President to torm the government
## Collective Responsibility
• This is the bedrock principle of parliamentary government. The ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general and to the Lok Sabha in particular (Article 75).
• They act as a team, and swim and sink together. The principle of collective responsibility implies that the Lok Sabha can remove the ministry (i.e., the council of ministers headed by the prime minister) trom office by passing a vote of no confidence.
Political Homogeneity
• Usually, members of the council of ministers belong to the same political party, and hence they snare the same political ideology. In the case of the coalition government, the ministers are bound by consensus.

• The ministers are members of both the legislature and the executive. This means that a person cannot be a minister without being a member of Parliament The Constitution stipulates that a minister who is not a member of the Parliament tor a period of six consecutive
months ceases to be a minister.

• The Prime Minister plays a leadership role in this system of government. Hence, statement 4 is not correct.
• He is the leader of the council of ministers, the leader of the Parliament, and the leader of the party in power. In these capacities, ne plays a significant and highly crucial role in the functioning of the government
## Dissolution of the Lower House
• The lower house of the Parliament (Lok Sabha) can be dissolved by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. In other words, the prime minister can advise the President to dissolve the Lok Sabha before the expiry of its term and hold fresh elections.
• This means that the executive enjoys the right to get the legislature dissolved in a parliamentary system.
## Secrecy
• The ministers operate on the principle of secrecy of procedure and cannot divulge information about their proceedings, policies, and decisions. They take the oath of secrecy before entering their office. The oath of secrecy to the ministers is administered by
the President.

## reasons for adoption of parliamentary system
The framers of the Indian constitution preferred the British parliamentary system due to the following reasons

Familiarity with the System:
• The constitution-makers were familiar with the parliamentary system that had been in operation in India during British rule.

Preference to More Responsibility:
• Dr B R Ambedkar pointed out in the Constituent Assembly that 'a democratic executive must satisfy two conditions:- stability and responsibility.
• Unfortunately, it has not been possible so far to devise a system that can ensure both in equal degrees.
• The American Presidential system gives more stability but less responsibility.
• The British Parliamentary system, on the other hand, gives more responsibility but less stability. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect.
• The Draft Constitution in recommending the parliamentary system of the executive has preferred more responsibility to more stability.

Need to Avoid Legislative - Executive Conflicts:
• The framers of the constitution wanted to avoid the conflicts between the legislature and the executive which are bound to occur in the Presidential system.

Nature of Indian Society:
• India is one of the most heterogeneous and complex plural societies in the world.
• Hence the constitution-makers adopted the parliamentary system as it offers greater scope for giving representation to various sections, interests and regions in the government.
