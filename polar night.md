- the polar night is a phenomenon where the nighttime lasts for more than 24 hours that occurs in the northernmost and southernmost regions of earth. this occurs only inside the polar circles. the opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the sun remains above the horizon for more than 24 hours. 

- "night" is understood as the center of the sun being below a free horizon. since the atmosphere refracts sunlight, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. the polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at approximately 66.5Â°. while it is day in the arctic circle, it is night in the antarctic circle, and vice versa.

- any planet or moon with a sufficient axial tilt that rotates with respect to its star significantly more frequently than it orbits the star (no tidal locking between the two) will experience the same phenomenon (a nighttime lasting more than one rotation period).
