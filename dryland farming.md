On the basis of the main source of moisture for crops, the farming can be classified as irrigated and rainfed (barani).
Rainfed farming is further classified on the basis of the adequacy of soil moisture during cropping season into dryland and wetland farming.
In India, dryland farming is largely confined to regions having annual rainfall less than 75 cm.
These regions grow hardy and drought-resistant crops such as ragi, bajra, jowar, moong, gram and guar (fodder crops) and practise various measures of soil moisture conservation and rainwater harvesting.
In wetland farming, the rainfall is in excess of the soil moisture requirement of plants during the rainy season.
Such regions may face flood and soil erosion hazards.
These areas grow various water-intensive crops such as rice, jute and sugarcane and practise aquaculture in the freshwater bodies.
