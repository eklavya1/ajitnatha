- the kaveri (also known as cauvery, the anglicized name) is an indian river flowing through the states of [[karnataka]] and [[tamil nadu]]. in ancient tamil literature, it was also called ponni (the golden maid, in reference to the fine silt it deposits). the kaveri river rises at talakaveri in the brahmagiri range in the western ghats, kodagu district of the state of  karnataka, at an elevation of 1,341 m above mean sea level and flows for about 800 km before its outfall into the bay of bengal. it reaches the sea in poompuhar in mayiladuthurai district. it is the third largest river – after godavari and krishna – in southern india, and the largest in the state of tamil nadu, which, on its course, bisects the state into north and south.

- the kaveri is a sacred river to the people of south india and is worshipped as the goddess kaveriamma. it is considered to be among the seven holy rivers of india. it is extensively used for agriculture in both of the aforementioned states. the etymology of the river was derived from the sankheti word for "river", காவிரி ಕಾವೇರಿ (kāvēri), as this is the major river for the sankethi people that live along its waters.

- the catchment area of the kaveri basin is estimated to be 81,155 square kilometres (31,334 sq mi) with many tributaries including harangi, hemavati, kabini, bhavani, lakshmana tirtha, noyyal and arkavati. the river basin covers three states and a union territory as follows: tamil nadu, 43,868 square kilometres (16,938 sq mi); karnataka, 34,273 square kilometres (13,233 sq mi); kerala, 2,866 square kilometres (1,107 sq mi), and puducherry, 148 square kilometres (57 sq mi). in chamarajanagar district it forms the island of shivanasamudra, on either side of which are the scenic shivanasamudra falls that descend about 100 metres (330 ft). the river is the source for an extensive irrigation system and for hydroelectric power. the river has supported irrigated agriculture for centuries and served as the lifeblood of the ancient kingdoms and modern cities of southern india. access to the river's waters has pitted indian states against each other for decades. it was profusely described in the tamil sangam literature and is held in great reverence in hinduism. the kaveri river delta is a thickly populated delta, one which is frequently affected by tropical cyclones formed in the [[bay of bengal]].
