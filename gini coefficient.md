- Gini Coefficient is a _statistical measure_ of [[inequality]]. #imp _not theoretical_ like [[kuznets curve]]
- d formula is A/(A+B) where,
	- 'A' is d area between d [[lorenz curve]] & d _Line of perfect Equality_;
	- 'B' is d area between d Lorenz curve & d _Line of perfect Inequality_.
- Gini-Coefficient thus varies from '0' to '1' with a lower value representing more equality than a higher value.
