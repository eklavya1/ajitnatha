performance of UN,
peacekeeping operation,
challenges faced by peacekeeping operation,
india's role in a peacekeeping operation, etc.

## responsibility to protect (r2p)
(at 1.50 pm)
responsibility to protect embodies international communities commitment to end worst form of violence & persecution.
it's international norm that seeks to ensure that international community never again fails to halt mass atrocities, crimes of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, & crimes against humanity.
r2p rests on 3 pillars of equal standing:
piller-1:
responsibility of each state to protect its population,
piller-2:
responsibility of international community in protecting their population.  
piller-3:
responsibility of international communities to protect when a state manifestly fails to protect its population.

## evaluation of performance of un wrto development
(at 1.59 pm)
performance of un:
performance of un has been decent.
several funds & programs & specialised agencies like fao, who, wb, etc have undertaken decent steps to ensure development.
however, challenge is in terms of limited funds with un.
suggestions:
as of now, membership is only source of funding for un.
some other independent sources of funding can be introduced. for instance, tobin tax to tax international financial floors.

## reforms of UN
(at 2.28 pm)
charter reform
financial reform
institutional reform.
### charter reform
a. reference to 'enemy states' ( with respect to axis powers of ww-2) should be dropped.
b. article 2 (7) of un stops involvement of un in intra-state dispute = interference in domestic affairs.
therefore this article needs to be amended to allow un to end interference & intra-state disputes to ensure world peace & security. 
### financial reform
un suffers from budget limitations.
also, few countries often delay, at times, default on their membership fee payment.
huge corruption & inefficient utilization of fund.
suggestion: apart from membership fee, some additional sources of funding for un. eg: tobin tax. 
### institutional reform
diff organs under this:
unga:
better coordination b/w unga & unsc.
ecosoc:
given its very wide mandate & a number of funds & programs with overlapping mandates has been established under ecosoc making it unwieldy body.
suggestion: streamline mandates of funds & programs & abolish non-essential ones.
un secretariat:
issues like corruption, red-tapism, overrepresentation of west in secretariat bureaucracy.
suggested solution: just representations of countries of east, check bureaucratic red-tapism & over-representation.
trusteeship council:
either abolish or give it new mandate such as global commons eg: environment council in antarctica & council for space.
unsc:
a. membership reform: 
why membership reform:
when un was founded in 1945, unsc's membership (permanent + non-permanent) was of eleven countries with p5 (five) permanent.
in 1965, number of non-permanent members was raised from six to ten & hence total membership = p5 (permanent members) + 10 non-permanent members= 15 members while in un membership there were 117 members.
in 2022, there are 193 members in un while unsc still represents total 15 members.
in 1945, when un was founded these five countries (p5) were global powers but today global power structure has changed.
countries like india, japan & other middle power countries have become important.
thus, p5 no longer represents world leadership.
since global financial crisis of 2008, global power has shifted from west to east.
also, with nearly a four-fold increase in total membership in un, unsc is no longer sufficiently increased.
europe is overly reprinted 'asia- continent with largest population' is under-represented while africa & latin america are not represented at all.   
## aspiring countries & regions
g4 countries (india, germany, brazil & japan) together seek permanent membership of unsc. however, their membership is countered by coffee club.
coffee club comprises countries like italy, spain, argentina, pakistan, south korea, canada, australia.
these are prime movers of this 40 odd countries led organisation.
they (coffee club) opposed g4 candidature by contesting their leadership of region.
since they are not regional leaders they can not be accorded seats as global powers.
to placate "coffee club", g4 countries have accepted that they will accept permanent membership without veto power for 15 years.
however, coffee club continues to oppose their candidature & had rather proposed uniting consensus resolution that proposes that unsc's membership expansion should be based in consensus of un member countries rather than majority as suggested under un charter.
## african union (au)
it seeks permanent seats in unsc for 2 african countries.
au's membership claims are laid by c10 (community of 10 countries) which in turn is led by sierra leone.
they demand 2 permanent seats based on *[[ezulwini consensus]]* that is they will not accept permanent seats of unsc without veto power.
however, there is no agreement wrto which 2 countries of africa will be given permanent membership.

## l.69
it's a group of developing countries from africa, latin america & caribbean, asia & pacific.
presently, it has 42 member countries.
india & brazil are working on membership reform of unsc through l69 as well.
oic (organisation of islamic council)   
they also claim permanent membership of unsc for islamic countries.
however, their claim remains weak.
since there is no provision for religious representation in un charter.
## case for india's permanent membership:
why:
it will bolster india's credential as a global power.
by becoming a permanent member of unsc, india will gain a say in various parts of un.
by gaining veto, india will be able to ensure that organisation will not be misused against india.
india will be able to safeguard & promote its interests more effectively.
it will help india achieve its long-standing ambition of securing for itself a rightful place in *[[comity of nations]]* by virtue of being a civilisation state.
## grounds/india's credentials
world's largest functioning democracy.
third-largest economy in terms of ppp terms.
seventh largest in terms of geographical size.
second most populous country.
de-facto nuclear-weapon state with a very responsible track record.
one of largest militaries in world.
india is leader of 3rd world (that is developing countries).
one of largest troop contributors in un peacekeeping force.
only country apart from japan with a constitutional commitment to world peace.
civilizational value of non-violence, pluralism, vasudhaiv kutumbakam to have conducive world peace.
on all these grounds, india seeks a permanent membership.   
## steps that were taken by govt of india
it would soften partnership with developed & developing countries.
since p4 out of p5 countries support india's candidature.
india has put forth its candidature on individual basis as well as a part of a group such as g4.
india is willing to accept unsc with or without veto for 15 years.
india has served as a non-permanent member eight times & each time except once when it lost to japan, india was elected with overwhelming support.
## what unsc will gain
inclusion of india as a country that takes a principled stand on global issues based on their merit will impart credibility of unsc.
it can act as a bridge & a moderator b/w existing p3 & p2 divide.
no other country in world except for india in terms of growing its civilizational values & constitutional ideals (article 51) is as close to un as is india.
## prospects of india gaining such a membership:
acc to political experts, prospect of unsc membership expansion in near future is quite grim.
if expansion was to take place, india would be a strong prospective candidate.
in meantime, it's suggested that india would do better to focus on its internal development rather than chase, as of now allusive dreams of permanent membership in unsc.
b. procedural reforms of unsc: 
## veto reform
since veto of p5 countries has become primary reason for deadlock in unsc, veto reforms are suggested.
veto power for p5 countries was not part of original plan "they were incorporated only on insistence of then ussr".
## reforms suggested
abolition of veto power is not a feasible option.
what member countries can do is to limit its usage.
thus restricting use of veto while p5 countries in circumstances when their core national interests are involved is suggested.
[[united nations general assembly]] should have power to override veto by a sp majority.
## other procedural reforms under unsc would be
better coordination b/w unga & unsc.
in case of peacekeeping operations, p5 should concern with true contributing nations before finalising mandate.
## conclusion of unsc
- in words of ban-ki-moon ([Psy teaches Ban Ki-moon 'Gangnam Style' - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fsZnIcZoA4)) , former secretary-general of un, "we require not less but more un".
- former us president during founding speech of un had suggested that un will be mineable to interest of its member state. its relevance or cause of legitimacy crisis would be dependent on action of member states.
- since in present world, with rising of several trans-national challenges & growing interdependency b/w countries, organization like un has become essential. therefore member states should ensure its relevance.
- another former secretary-general of un said "*purpose behind to establish un was not to establish heaven on earth rather prevent hell breaking earth*"
