[[2022-04-24]] 16:00 [Battle of Chillianwala - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Battle_of_Chillianwala)
The Battle of Chillianwala was fought in January 1849 *during the Second Anglo-Sikh War* in the Chillianwala region of Punjab[4] (Mandi Bahauddin), now part of modern-day Pakistan. The battle was one of the bloodiest fought by the British East India Company. Both armies held their positions at the end of the battle and both sides claimed victory.[5] The battle was a strategic check to immediate British ambitions in India and a shock to British military prestige.[1]
