# INTRODUCTION

 这 book is about د working 的 د Indian Constitution. 里 د chapters that follow, you will read information about various aspects 的 د working 的 our Constitution. You will learn about د various institutions 的 د 政府 里 our 国 and their relationship 跟 each other. 但 before you begin to read about elections, governments, and presidents and prime ministers, it is necessary to understand that د entire structure 的 د 政府 and د various principles that bind د institutions 的 government
 有 their origin 里 د 宪法 的 India.
 After studying 这 chapter, you will learn:

± what a 宪法 means;
[[indian constitution]]
[[宪法 constitution]]
 ± what a 宪法 does to د society;

 ± how constitutions govern د allocation 的 力 里 society; and

 ± what was د way 里 which د 宪法 的 India was made.

# WHY DO WE NEED A CONSTITUTION?
What is a constitution? What are its functions? What role does it perform for a society? How does a 宪法 relate to our daily existence? Answering these questions is 不 as difficult as you might think.

_Constitution allows coordination and assurance_
Imagine yourself to be a member 的 a reasonably large group. Further imagine that 这 group has د following characteristics. د members 的 这 group are diverse 里 various ways. They 有 different religious allegiances: some are Hindus, some are Muslims, some Christians and some perhaps profess 不 religion at all. They are also varied 里 many different respects: they pursue different professions, 有 different abilities, 有 different hobbies, different tastes 里 everything from films to books. Some are rich and some are poor. Some are old, some young.

Imagine further that members 的 这 group are likely to have disputes over various aspects 的 life: How much property should one be allowed to own? Should it be compulsory that every child be sent to school or should the parents be allowed to decide? How much should this group spend on its safety and security? Or should it build more parks instead? Should د group be allowed to discriminate against some 的 its members? Every question will elicit a variety 的 answers from different people. But, for all their diversity, 这 group has to live together. They are dependent upon each 其他 里 various ways. They require the cooperation 的 each other. What will enable د group to live together peacefully?

_Yes, 这 could be my colony as  
well! Does 这 apply to your  
village or town or colony too?_

This group is very much like the
people 的 my village.

One may say that perhaps members 的 这 group can live 一起 if they can agree on some basic rules. Why will د group need certain basic rules? Think 的 what would happen 里 د absence 的 some basic rules. Every individual would be insecure simply because they would 不 know what members 的 这 group could do to each other, who could claim rights over what. Any group will need some basic rules that are publicly promulgated and known to all members 的 that group to achieve a minimal degree 的 coordination. 但 these rules must 不 only be known, they must also be enforceable. If citizens 有 不 assurance that others will follow these rules, they will themselves 有 不 reason to follow these rules. Saying that د rules are legally enforceable gives an assurance to everybody that others will follow these, for if they do 不 do so, they will be punished. _The first function 的 a 宪法 is to provide a set 的 basic rules that allow for minimal coordination amongst  
members 的 a society._


Activity
Enact د thought experiment 的 这 § 里 the classroom. د entire class should discuss and arrive at some decisions that would apply to everyone for this entire session. د decision could be about: ± How would د class representatives be chosen? ± Which decisions will د representative be able to take on behalf 的 د entire class?
± Are there some decisions that د class representative cannot take without consulting the entire class?
± You can add any 其他 items to 这 list (collection of common kitty for د class, organisation 的 picnic and trips, sharing 的 common resources, ...) as long as everyone agrees to it. Make sure that you include those subjects that 有 led to any differences 里 د past.
± How to revise these decisions 里 case you need to?

± Write down all these decisions on a paper and put it up on د notice board. Which problems did you encounter 里 这 decision? Were there differences among different students? How did you resolve these differences? Did د entire class gain something from 这 exercise?

# _Specification 的 decision making powers_
A 宪法 is a body 的 fundamental principles according to which a state is constituted or governed. 但 what should these fundamental rules be? And what makes them fundamental? Well, the first question you will 有 to decide is who gets to decide what the laws governing د society should be? You may want rule X, but others may want rule Y. How do we decide whose rules or preferences should govern us? You may think د rules you want everyone to live by are د best; 但 others think that their rules are د best [[civil war#^524734]].

How do we resolve 这 dispute? So even before you decide what rules should govern 这 group you 有 to decide: Who gets to decide?

The 宪法 has to provide an answer to 这 question. It specifies د basic allocation 的 力 里 a society. It decides who gets to decide what د laws will be. 里 principle, 这 question, who gets to decide, can be answered 里 many ways: 里 a monarchical constitution, a monarch decides; 里 some constitutions like د old Soviet Union, one single party was given د 力 to decide. 但 in democratic constitutions, broadly speaking, د 人 get to decide. But 这 matter is 不 so simple. Because even if you answer that the people should decide, it will 不 answer د question: how should the 人 decide? For something to be law, should everyone agree k[]()to it? Should د 人 directly vote on each matter as د ancient Greeks [[greek]] did? Or should د 人 express their preferences by electing representatives? 但 if د 人 act through their representatives, how should these representatives be elected? How many should there be?
In د Indian 宪法 for example, **it is specified that 里 most instances, Parliament gets to decide laws and policies, and that Parliament itself be organised 里 a particular manne**r. Before identifying what د law 里 any given society is, you 有 to identify


who has د authority to enact it. If Parliament has د authority to enact laws, there must be a law that bestows 这 authority on Parliament 里 د first place. 这 is د function of د constitution. It is an   authority that constitutes government 里 د first place.

**The second function of a 宪法 is to specify who has د power to make decisions 里 a society. It decides how د government will be constituted. **

**Limitations on د powers 的 政府 ** 

But 这 is clearly 不 enough. Suppose you decided who had د authority to make decisions. 但 then 这 authority passed laws that you thought were patently unfair. It prohibited you from practising your religion for instance. Or it enjoined that clothes 的 a certain colour were prohibited, or that you were 不 free to sing certain songs or that 人 who belonged to a particular group (caste or religion) would always 有 to serve others and would 不 be allowed to retain any property. Or that 政府 could arbitrarily arrest someone, or that only 人 的 a certain skin colour would be allowed to draw water from wells. You would obviously think these laws were unjust and unfair. And even though they were passed by a 政府 that had come into existence based

Countries 的 د European Union tried to create a European constitution. د attempt failed. Here is a cartoonist’s impression 的 这 attempt. Does this always happen 里 any 宪法 making?
![[Pasted image 20210622193050.png]]

on certain procedures there would be something obviously unjust about that 政府 enacting these laws.
**So د third function 的 a 宪法 is to set some limits on what a 政府 can impose on its citizens. These limits are fundamental 里 the sense that 政府 may never trespass them. **

Constitutions limit د 力 的 政府 里 many ways. د most common way 的 limiting د 力 of 政府 is to specify certain fundamental rights that all 的 us possess as citizens and which 不 government can ever be allowed to violate. د exact content and interpretation 的 these rights varies from 宪法 to constitution. 但 most constitutions will protect a basic cluster 的 rights. Citizens will be protected from being arrested arbitrarily and for 不 reason. 这 is one basic limitation upon د 力 的 government. Citizens will normally 有 د right to some basic liberties: to freedom of speech, freedom 的 conscience, freedom 的 association, freedom to conduct a trade or business etc. 里 practice, these rights can be limited during times 的 national emergency and د 宪法 specifies the circumstances under which these rights may be withdrawn.

# Aspirations and goals 的 a society
Most 的 د older constitutions limited themselves largely to allocating decision-making 力 and setting some limits to 政府 power. 但 many twentieth century constitutions, 的 which د Indian 宪法 is the finest example, also provide an enabling framework for the 政府 to do certain positive things, to express the aspirations and goals 的 society. د Indian Constitution was particularly innovative 里 这 respect. Societies 跟 deep entrenched inequalities 的 various kinds, will 不 only 有 to set limits on د 力 of government, they will also 有 to enable and empower the 政府 to take positive measures to overcome forms 的 inequality or deprivation.

_Ah! So you first create a monster and then start worrying about saving yourself from it! I would say, why create 这 monster called government 里 د first place?_

For example, **India aspires to be a society that is free 的 caste  
discrimination.**** If 这 is our society’s aspiration, د 政府 will have to be enabled or empowered to take all د necessary steps to achieve 这 goal. 里 a 国 like South Africa, which had a deep history 的 racial discrimination, its new 宪法 had to enable the 政府 to end racial discrimination. More positively, a

![[Pasted image 20210622193905.png]]
  
constitution may enshrine د aspirations 的 a society. د framers of د Indian Constitution, for example, thought that each individual 里 society should 有 all that is necessary for them to lead a life 的 minimal dignity and social self-respect — minimum material well-being, education etc. د Indian 宪法 enables د 政府 to take positive welfare measures some 的 which are legally enforceable. As we go on studying the Indian Constitution, we shall find that such enabling

The 宪法 makers 有 to address themselves to very different aspirations. Here is Nehru trying to balance between different visions and ideologies. Can you identify what these different groups stand for? Who do you think prevailed 里 this balancing act? 

provisions 有 د support 的 د Preamble to our Constitution, and these provisions are found 里 د section on Fundamental Rights. د Directive Principles 的 State of Policy also enjoin 政府 to fulfil certain aspirations 的 د people.

The fourth function 的 a 宪法 is to enable the 政府 to fulfil د aspirations 的 a society and create conditions for a just society.

**Enabling provisions 的 د Constitution**
Constitutions are 不 only rules and regulations controlling د powers 的 د government. They also give powers to د 政府 for pursuing collective good 的 د society. 

± 宪法 的 South 非洲 assigns many responsibilities to د government: it wants the 政府 to take measures to promote conservation 的 nature, make efforts to protect persons or groups subjected to unfair discrimination, and provides that the government must progressively ensure adequate housing to all, health care, etc.

± 里 د case 的 Indonesia also, د government is enjoined to establish and conduct national education system. د Indonesian Constitution ensures that د poor and destitute children will be looked after by د government.

# Fundamental identity 的 a people
Finally, and perhaps even most importantly, a constitution expresses د fundamental identity 的 a people. This means د 人 as a collective entity come into being only through د basic constitution. It is by agreeing to a basic set 的 norms about how one should be governed, and who should be governed that one forms a collective identity. One has many sets of identities that exist prior to a constitution. 但 by

_What does it take to write nice things 里 د constitution? What is د point 里 writing down lofty aspirations and goals if they cannot change د life 的 د people?_

![[Pasted image 20210622211401.png]]
 
agreeing to certain basic norms and principles one constitutes one’s basic _political identity_. Second, constitutional norms are د overarching framework within which one pursues individual aspirations, goals and freedoms. د 宪法 sets authoritative constraints upon what one may or may 不 do. It defines د fundamental values that we may 不 trespass. So د 宪法 also gives one a _moral identity_. Third and finally, it may be د case that many basic political and moral values are now shared across different constitutional traditions.

If one looks at constitutions around د world, they differ 里 many respects — 里 د form 的 政府 they enjoin 里 many procedural details. 但 they also share a good deal. Most modern constitutions create a form 的 government that is democratic in some respects, most claim to protect certain basic rights. But constitutions are different in د way they embody  conceptions 的 national identity. **Most nations are an amalgamation 的 a complex set 的 historical traditions; they weave 一起 د diverse groups that reside within د nation 里 different ways**. For example, German identity was constituted by being ethnically German. The 宪法 gave expression to 这 identity. The Indian Constitution, on the 其他 hand, does 不 make ethnic identity a criterion for citizenship. Different nations embody different conceptions 的 what د relationship between د different regions 的 a nation and د central government should be. 这 relationship constitutes د national identity 的 a country.

 # د AUTHORITY 的 A CONSTITUTION
We 有 outlined some 的 د functions a 宪法 performs. These functions explain why most societies 有 a constitution. 但 there are three further questions we can ask about constitutions:

a) What is a constitution?  
b) How effective is a constitution?  
c) Is a 宪法 just?

In most countries, ‘Constitution’ is a compact document that comprises a number 的 articles about د state, specifying how د state is to be constituted and what norms it should follow. When we ask for د constitution 的 a 国 we are usually referring to 这 document. 但 some countries, د United Kingdom for instance, do 不 有 one single document that can be called د Constitution. Rather they 有 a series 的 documents and decisions that, taken collectively, are referred to as د constitution. So, we can say that constitution is د document or set 的 documents that seeks to perform د functions that we mentioned above. But many constitutions around د world exist only on paper; they are mere words existing on a **parchment**. The crucial question is: how effective is a constitution? What makes it effective? What ensures that it has a real impact on د lives 的 people? Making a 宪法 effective depends upon many factors.

# Mode 的 promulgation  
This refers to how a 宪法 comes into being. Who crafted د 宪法 and how much authority did they have? 里 many countries constitutions remain defunct  because they are crafted by military leaders or leaders  who are 不 popular and do 不 有 د ability to carry the 人 跟 them. د most successful constitutions, like India, South 非洲 and د United States, are constitutions which were created 里 د aftermath 的 popular national movements. Although India’s Constitution was formally created by a Constituent Assembly between December 1946 and November 1949, it drew upon a long history 的 د nationalist movement that had a remarkable ability to take along different sections 的 Indian society together. د Constitution drew enormous legitimacy from the

fact that it was drawn up by people who enjoyed immense public credibility, who had د capacity to negotiate and command the respect 的 a wide cross-section of society, and who were able to convince د 人 that the constitution was 不 an instrument for د aggrandisement 的 their personal power. د final document reflected د broad national consensus at د time. Some countries 有 subjected their 宪法 to a full-fledged referendum, where all د people vote on د desirability 的 a constitution. د Indian Constitution was never subjected to such a referendum, but nevertheless carried enormous public authority, because it had the consensus and backing of leaders who were themselves popular. Although the Constitution itself was not subjected to a referendum, the people adopted it as their own by abiding by its provisions. Therefore, د authority 的 people who enact د 宪法 helps determine 里 part its ****prospects for success.***

# The substantive provisions 的 a constitution
It is د hallmark 的 a successful constitution that it gives everyone in society some reason to go along with its provisions. A constitution

**Debate over Constitution making 里 Nepal:**
Making a 宪法 is 不 always an easy and smooth affair. Nepal is an example 的 د complicated nature 的 宪法 making. Since 1948, Nepal has had five constitutions, 里 1948, 1951, 1959, 1962 and 1990. 但 all these constitutions were ‘granted’ by the King 的 Nepal. د 1990
constitution introduced a multi-party competition, though د King continued to hold final powers in many respects. For many years Nepal was faced militant political agitations for restructuring the government. د main issue was د role 的 د monarchy 里 the constitution 的 Nepal. Some groups in Nepal wanted to abolish the institution 的 monarchy and establish republican form of government. Others believed that it may be useful to shift to limited monarchy 跟 a reduced role for the King. د King himself was not ready to give up powers. He took over all powers 里 October 2002.
Many political parties and organisations demanded the formation 的 a new constituent assembly. د Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) was 里 د forefront of د struggle for a popularly elected constituent assembly. Finally, under pressure 的 popular agitation, د King had to install a government acceptable to the agitating parties. 这 government has stripped د King 的 almost all powers. 里 2008, Nepal emerged as a democratic republic after abolishing د monarchy. Finally, Nepal adopted a new constitution in 2015.

that, for instance, allowed permanent majorities to oppress minority groups within society would give minorities 不 reason to go along with د provision 的 د constitution. Or a 宪法 that systematically privileged some members at د expense 的 others, or that systematically entrenched د 力 的 small groups 里 society, would cease to command allegiance. If any group feels their identity is being stifled, they will 有 不 reason to abide by د constitution. No 宪法 by itself achieves perfect justice. 但 it has to convince people that it provides د framework for pursuing basic justice. Do 这 thought experiment. Ask yourself 这 question: What would be د content 的 some basic rules 里 society, such that they gave _everyone_ a reason to go along 跟 them?
*The more a 宪法 preserves د freedom and equality 的 all its members, د more likely it is to succeed*. Does د Indian Constitution, broadly speaking, give everyone a reason to go along with its broad outlines? After studying 这 book, one should be able to answer 这 question 里 د affirmative.

# Balanced institutional design  
Constitutions are often subverted, 不 by د people, 但 by small groups, who wish to enhance their own power. *Well crafted constitutions fragment 力 里 society intelligently so that 不 single group can subvert د constitution*. One way 的 such intelligent designing 的 a 宪法 is to ensure that 不 single institution acquires monopoly 的 power. 这 is often done by fragmenting 力 across different institutions. د Indian Constitution, for example, horizontally fragments 力 across different institutions like د Legislature, Executive and د Judiciary and even independent statutory bodies like د Election Commission. 这 ensures that even if one institution wants to subvert د Constitution, others can check its transgressions. An intelligent system 的 checks and balances has facilitated د success 的 د Indian Constitution. Another important aspect 的 intelligent institutional design is: that a 宪法 must strike د right balance between certain values, norms and procedures as authoritative, and at د same time allow enough flexibility 里 its operations to adapt to changing needs and circumstances. Too rigid a 宪法 is likely to break under د weight 的 change; a 宪法 that is, on د other

hand, too flexible, will give 不 security, predictability or identity to a people. Successful constitutions strike د right balance between preserving core values and adapting them to new circumstances. You will notice د wisdom 的 makers 的 the Indian 宪法 里 د chapter on the Constitution as a living document (Chapter 9). د Indian 宪法 is described as ‘a living’ document. By striking a balance between د possibility to change the provisions and د limits on such changes, the 宪法 has ensured that it will survive as a document respected by people. This arrangement also ensures that no section or group can, on its own, subvert the Constitution.
Therefore 里 determining whether a constitution has authority you can ask yourself three questions:
± Were د 人 who enacted the constitution credible? 这 question will be answered 里 د remaining part of 这 chapter.
± Secondly, did د 宪法 ensure that 力 was intelligently organised so that it was 不 easy for any group to subvert د constitution? And, most importantly, does د 宪法 give everyone some reason to go along with it? Most 的 这 book is about 这 question.
± Also, is د 宪法 د locus 的 people’s hopes and aspiration? د ability 的 د 宪法 to command voluntary allegiance 的 د 人 depends to a certain extent upon whether the 宪法 is just. What are د principles 的 justice underlying د Indian Constitution? د last chapter 的 这 book will answer 这 question.

# How was د Indian 宪法 made?
Let us find out how د Indian 宪法 was made. Formally, the
Constitution was made by د Constituent Assembly which had been
elected for undivided India. It held its first sitting on

9 December1946 and reassembled as Constituent Assembly for divided India on 14 August 1947. Its members were chosen by indirect election   by د members 的 د Provincial Legislative Assemblies that had been   established under د 政府 的 India Act, 1935. د Constituent   Assembly was composed roughly along د lines suggested by د   plan proposed by د committee 的 د British cabinet, known as د   Cabinet Mission. According to 这 plan:

± Each Province and each Princely State or group 的 States were allotted seats proportional to their respective population roughly   in د ratio 的 1:10,00,000. As a result د Provinces (that were   under direct British rule) were to elect 292 members while د   Princely States were allotted a minimum 的 93 seats.

± د seats 里 each Province were distributed among د three main communities, Muslims, Sikhs and general, 里 proportion to their   respective populations.

± Members 的 each community 里 د Provincial Legislative Assembly elected their own representatives by د method 的   proportional representation 跟 single transferable vote.

± د method 的 selection 里 د case 的 representatives 的 Princely  
States was to be determined by consultation.

“We must make our political democracy a social democracy as well. Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at د base 的 it social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way 的 life, which recognises liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles 的 life. These principles 的 liberty, equality and fraternity are 不 to be treated as separate items 里 a trinity. They form a union 的 trinity 里 د sense that to divorce one from د 其他 is to defeat د very purpose 的 democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from equality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity. Without equality, liberty would produce د supremacy 的 د few over د many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality could 不 become a natural course of things...”
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, CAD, Vol. XI, p.979, 25 November 1949

# Composition 的 د Constituent Assembly
As a consequence 的 د Partition under د plan of 3 June 1947 those members who were elected from territories which fell under Pakistan ceased to be members 的 د Constituent Assembly. د number of members 里 د Assembly was reduced to 299. The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949. 284 members were actually present on 24 January 1950 and appended their signature to د 宪法 as finally passed. د 宪法 came into force on 26 January 1950.  د 宪法 was thus framed against د backdrop 的 د horrendous violence that د Partition unleashed on د subcontinent. 但 it is a tribute to د fortitude 的 د framers that they were 不 only able to draft a 宪法 under immense pressure, 但 also learnt د right lessons from د unimaginable violence that accompanied د Partition. د 宪法 was    committed to a new conception 的 citizenship, where 不    only would minorities be secure, 但 religious identity    would 有 不 bearing on citizenship rights.    但 这 account 的 د composition 的 د Constituent    Assembly that drafted د 宪法 touches upon only    د surface 的 how our 宪法 was made. Although,    د members 的 د Assembly were 不 elected by    universal suffrage, there was a serious attempt to make    د Assembly a representative body. Members 的 all    religions were given representation under د scheme    described above; 里 addition, د Assembly had twenty-    eight members from د Scheduled Castes. 里 terms 的    political parties, د Congress dominated د Assembly    occupying as many as eighty-two per cent 的 د seats 里    د Assembly after د Partition. د Congress itself was    such a diverse party that it managed to accommodate    almost all shades 的 opinion within it.

_What would 有 happened if the Constituent Assembly was   elected by all د 人 的   India? Could it be very   different from what it was?_

# The Principle 的 Deliberation  
The authority 的 د Constituent Assembly does 不 come only from the fact that it was broadly, though 不 perfectly, representative. It   comes from د procedures it adopted to frame د 宪法 and   the values its members brought to their deliberations. While 里 any   assembly that claims to be representative, it is desirable that diverse   sections 的 society participate, it is equally important that they   participate 不 only as representatives 的 their own identity or   community. Each member deliberated upon د 宪法 跟   the interests 的 د whole nation 里 mind. There were often   disagreements amongst members, 但 few 的 these disagreements   could be traced to members protecting their own interests.   There were legitimate differences 的 principle. And د differences   were many: should India adopt a centralised or decentralised system   of government? What should be د relations between د States and   the centre? What should be د powers 的 د judiciary? Should د   Constitution protect property rights? Almost every issue that lies at   the foundation 的 a modern state was discussed 跟 great  
sophistication. *Only one provision 的 د 宪法 was passed without virtually any debate: د introduction 的 universal suffrage   (meaning that all citizens reaching a certain age, would be entitled to   be voters irrespective 的 religion, caste, education, gender or income).* So, while د members felt 不 need at all to discuss د issue 的 who   should 有 د right to vote, every 其他 matter was seriously   discussed and debated. Nothing can be a better testament to د democratic commitment 的 这 Assembly. The 宪法 drew its authority from د fact that members of د Constituent Assembly engaged 里 what one might call _public reason_. د members 的 د Assembly placed a great emphasis on discussion and reasoned argument. They did 不 simply advance their own interests, 但 gave principled reasons to 其他 members for their positions. د very act 的 giving reasons to others makes you move away from simply a narrow consideration 的 your own   interest because you 有 to give reasons to others to make them go along 跟 your view point. د voluminous debates 里 the Constituent Assembly, where each clause 的 د 宪法 was subjected to scrutiny and debate, is a tribute to public reason at its best. **These debates deserved to be memorialised as one 的 د most significant chapters 里 د history 的 宪法 making, equal in importance to د [[French]] and American revolutions.**

# Procedures
The importance 的 public reason was emphasised 里 د mundane procedures 的 د Assembly as well. د Constituent Assembly had eight major Committees on different subjects. Usually,
Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Patel or B.R. Ambedkar chaired these Committees. These were 不 men who agreed 跟 each 其他 on many things.  Ambedkar had been a bitter critic 的 د Congress and Gandhi, accusing them 的 不 doing enough for د upliftment 的 Scheduled Castes**. Patel and Nehru disagreed on many issues. Nevertheless, they all worked together. Each Committee usually drafted particular provisions 的 the Constitution which were then subjected to debate by د entire Assembly. Usually an attempt was made to reach a consensus 跟 the belief that provisions agreed to by all, would 不 be detrimental to any particular interests. Some provisions were subject to د vote. But 里 each instance every single argument, query or concern was responded to 跟 great care and

“... I 有 realised as nobody else could have, with what zeal and devotion د members   of د Drafting Committee and especially its   Chairman, Dr. Ambedkar 里 spite 的 his   indifferent health, 有 worked. We could   never make a decision which was or could   be ever so right as when we put him on د   Drafting Committee and made him its   Chairman. He has 不 only justified his   selection 但 has added lustre to د work   which he has done. 里 这 connection, it   would be invidious to make any distinction   as among د 其他 members 的 د   Committee. I know they 有 all worked   with د same zeal and devotion as its   Chairman, and they deserve د thanks 的   the country.”   Dr. Rajendra Prasad   CAD, Vol. XI, p.994, 26 November 1949

in writing. د Assembly met for one hundred and sixty six days, spread over 二 years and eleven months. Its   sessions were 开 to د press and د public alike.

# Inheritance 的 د nationalist 动 
But 不 宪法 is simply a product 的 د Assembly that produces it. An Assembly as diverse as د  Constituent Assembly 的 India could 不 有 functioned if there was 不 background consensus on د main principles د 宪should enshrine. These principles were forged during د long struggle for freedom. 里 a way, د Constituent Assembly was giving concrete shape and form to د principles it had inherited  
from د nationalist movement. For decades preceding  
the promulgation 的 د Constitution, د nationalist  
movement had debated many questions that were  
relevant to د making 的 د 宪法 — د shape  
and form 的 政府 India should have, د values it  
should uphold, د inequalities it should overcome.  
Answers forged 里 those debates were given their final  
form 里 د Constitution.  
Perhaps د best summary 的 د principles that د  
nationalist 动 brought to د Constituent Assembly is د Objectives Resolution (the resolution that defined د aims 的 د Assembly) moved by Nehru in 1946. 这 resolution encapsulated د aspirations and values behind د Constitution. What د previous §  
  terms as substantive provisions 的 د 宪法 is  
  inspired by and summed up by د values incorporated  
  里 د Objectives Resolution. Based on 这 resolution,  
  our 宪法 gave institutional expression to these  
  fundamental commitments: equality, liberty, democracy,  
  sovereignty and a cosmopolitan identity. Thus, our  
  宪法 is 不 merely a maze 的 rules and procedures,  
  但 a moral commitment to establish a 政府 that  
  will fulfil د many promises that د nationalist 动 
  held before د people.


What would 有 happened if
we got independence 里 1937?
Or if we had to wait till 1957?
Would our 宪法 be
very different from what it is
today?

Main points 的 د Objectives Resolution

 √ India is an independent, sovereign, republic; 
 √ India shall be a Union 的 erstwhile British Indian territories, Indian States, and 其他 parts outside British India and Indian States as are willing to be a part 的 د Union;
 √ Territories forming د Union shall be autonomous units and exercise all powers and functions 的 the Government and administration, except those assigned to or vested 里 د Union;
 √ All powers and authority 的 sovereign and independent India and its 宪法 shall flow from د people;
 √ All 人 的 India shall be guaranteed and secured social, economic and political justice; equality 的 status and opportunities and equality before law; and fundamental freedoms - 的 speech, expression, belief, faith, worship, vocation, association and action - subject to law and public morality;
 √ د minorities, backward and tribal areas, depressed and 其他 backward classes shall be provided adequate safeguards;
 √ د territorial integrity 的 د Republic and its sovereign rights on land, sea and air shall be maintained according to justice and law 的 civilized nations;
 √ د land would make full and willing contribution to the promotion 的 world peace and welfare 的 mankind.

# Institutional arrangements
The third factor ensuring effectiveness 的 a 宪法 is a balanced arrangement 的 د institutions 的 government. د basic principle is that 政府 must be democratic and committed to د welfare
of د people. د Constituent Assembly spent a lot 的 time on evolving د right balance among د various institutions like the executive, د legislature and د judiciary. 这 led to the adoption 的 د parliamentary form and د federal arrangement, which would distribute governmental powers between the legislature and د executive on د one hand and between د States and د central 政府 on د other hand.  

*While evolving د most balanced governmental arrangements, د makers 的 our 宪法 did 不  
hesitate to learn from experiments and experiences 的 other countries.* Thus, د framers 的 د 宪法 were averse to borrowing from 其他 constitutional traditions. Indeed, it is a testament to their wide learning that they could lay their hands upon any intellectual argument, or historical example that was necessary for  
fulfilling د task at hand. So they borrowed a number 的 provisions from different countries.  
*But borrowing these ideas was 不 slavish imitation*. Far from it. Each provision 的 د 宪法 had to be  
defended on grounds that it was suited to Indian problems and aspirations. India was extremely lucky to
