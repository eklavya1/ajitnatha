	- Vikramaditya (IAST: VikramƒÅditya) was a legendary emperor of ancient India. Often characterized as an ideal king, he is known for his generosity, courage, and patronage of scholars. Vikramaditya is featured in hundreds of traditional Indian stories, including those in Baital Pachisi and Singhasan Battisi. Many describe him as a universal ruler, with his [[capital]] at Ujjain (Pataliputra or Pratishthana in a few stories).
	-  Other scholars believe that Vikramaditya is a mythical character, since several legends about him are fantastic in nature.
	-  "Vikramaditya" was a common title adopted by several Indian kings, and the Vikramaditya legends [[may]] be embellished accounts of different kings (particularly [[Chandragupta II]]).
