# Geomorphology
- It is the study of the physical features of the earth and the processes in which these features are formed. 
- Important topics: Earth movement, Plate tectonics, etc.
# Origin and evolution of earth
- The planet Earth before 4800 million years ago (MYA) was barren, rocky, and hot with a very thin atmosphere of Hydrogen and helium.
- Due to the gradual increase in density, the process of density separation started causing heavy materials to sink towards the center of the earth and the later ones move towards the surface.
- With time, the earth cooled further and gradually condensed into smaller size
- The further process of differentiation led to the formation of different layers in the earth's interior Crust, Mantle, and Core
# The formation of Earth's Atmosphere
- Primordial thin atmosphere (Hydrogen and Helium) was stripped off due to solar winds
- During the cooling of the earth,  Gases and water vapor were released from the earth's interior. The processes through which these gases outpoured into the atmosphere is called [[Degassing]]
- The higher temperature of the earth's interior resulted in volcanic eruptions on the surface. Continuous volcanic eruptions released more gases into the atmosphere. Important gases in the atmosphere at this stage were: CO2, Nitrogen, Methane, Ammonia, Water vapor, and very little oxygen
- Cooling of the earth led to the condensation of water vapor and then precipitation- further led to cooling and condensation and precipitation
- The rainfall brought huge quantities of water to the surface which got collected in the depressions on the earth surface forming oceans around 4000 MYA
- During the period b/w 3500-2500 MYA, blue-green algae emerged in ocean waters which started to release oxygen through Photosynthesis. 
- By 2000 MYA, the oceans were saturated with Oxygen and Oxygen started flooding the atmosphere changing the composition of the Atmosphere and creating conditions favorable for the emergence of life on the surface.

# Interior of the Earth
## Sources of study of Earth's interior
### Direct Sources
- _Deep Ocean Drillings_ provide information about the earth's interior by extracting the material from the earth's interior.
- _Volcanic Eruptions_: through which the [[magma]] from the interior of the earth can be studied to reveal information regarding the composition, temperature, etc.
### Indirect Sources
 #pneumonic _dtsm_
- _Density studies_ : By analyzing the average density of the earth and its comparison to the density at the surface, we can conclude that the Core must be heavier and the crust must be lighter.
- _Temperature and Pressure studies_: It involves the study of variation in temperature as we go deeper into the earth's interior after considering the effect of higher pressure. Near to the surface, temperature increases at the rate of 1 degree C for every 32 meters. However, the temperature of the inner core is estimated to be 5200 degrees C.
- _Seismic studies_: It involves analyzing different earthquake waves and the changes in their direction and speed as they pass through the earth's interior.
- _Meteorites_: They are made of the same material as that of earth. The chemistry and mineralogy of Nickel and Iron Core of Meteorites provide information on the earth's interior.
## Chemical divisions
- based on the chemical composition of the earth #pneumonic _cmc_
_related_ [[discontinuities]]	
	[[Crust]]
	[[mantle ]]
	[[core]]
## Physical divisions
- based on physical characteristics #pneumonic _lamb_
	[[Lithosphere]]
	[[Asthenosphere]]
	[[mesosphere]]
	[[Barysphere]]
