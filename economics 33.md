[[iron man#mark 1]]
minimizng risk & preparng fr risk.

basel 2 norms [[iron man#mark 2]]
encompass widr range o risks.

basel 3 norms [[iron man#mark 3]]
market risk, financil risk, & oprationl risk
these r t prepr banks t face risks, mk dm strong, hv sm own mny t manage risks.
capitl t risk-weightd [[asset]]s r [[capital adequacy ratio]]
it's presently 9%.
provisionng o [[money]]- amount wch s furthr set aside.
dictatn (2.39 pm)

## health o banks & regulatn by rbi
[[rbi]] regulates lendng activities o banks by rducng risks dt banks undrtake n their lendng activities & by makng banks strongr.
regulatns r laid down by rbi & r also inspird by basel iii norms. these norms r regulatory norms fr financil systems by bcbs ([[basel committee on banking supervision]]).
bcbs s committee dt comprises representatives o centrl banks fm biggst economies o [[world]].
basel 3 norms prtn t envisagng mr risks & comprehensively, dt r facd by financil system. these risks include
	mrkt risks (chnc o failure o market),
	finncil risks (risk undrtakn due t financil activities dt s n lendng), or
	invstng mny as well as
	oprationl risks (ie risk incurrd n various aspects o oprations).
norms focus n rducng these diff risks & strengdnng bank’s capabilities t face dm n case risks matrialize.

**rbi implements these norms n indiusng 2 imp tools -**
	minimum capitl requirement
	provisionng requirements
crar = capitl t risk-weightd asset ratio r car
crar = capital/ risk-weightd assets wch r greatr thn r equl t 9% ie

capitl greatr thn r equl t 9% o rwa.
loans dt bank advances r its assets.

banks charg intrst rat basd n wtevr costs & [[profit]]s de dmselvs assess (refr t discussin n [[base rate]] & mclr).
[[rbi]] n othr hand regulates these lendng activities by settng standard risks against each type o loan & by layng down provisionng requirements against each [[loan]].
whenevr loan s advancd, banks r requird t provisin ie set aside sm money fm their own capitl acc t provisionng requirement laid down by rbi.
furthr acc t risk against loan set by rbi banks hv t calculat their risk-weightd assets (rwa).
against rwbanks hv t maintn minimum capitl requirement as specifid undr crar.
ovr & above crar, banks also hv t maintn ccb (capitl consrvatn buffr) o 2% o rwa.
ds ccb s dr so dt banks r able t cushin their crar requirement.
provisionng rqurment s nt constant. if loan shows signs o stress, dn provisionng against it'll inc acc t rbi’s norms.
by layng down provisionng & risks, rbi induces banks t undrtake less risky lendng.
n same amount o loan dt bank gives t riskir prsn as compard t less risky prsn capitl amount creatd n form o provisionng'll be greatr & ∴ capitl left wd be less.
furthr minimum capitl requirement, (as % o rwa)'ll also inc as risk against such loans wd be highr, & ∴; rwwill inc by greatr amount, puttng greatr stress n bank’s capital.

### nn prformng assets
(3.15 pm)
why do banks detriorat n health? wt r npas & why do npas occur.
wt cn be done t improve their health? how t address dm?
**nn prformng assets classificatn -**
[[asset]] - loan wch bank has given.
if asset does nt genrat intrest, dn it wd be [[non performing asset]].
loan= principl + intrst (paid n form o emi).
if dues (emi) r nt paid fr entire 1 month, now account s showng signs o stress.
ds'll be c/a sp mentiond account (sma) type 1.

if dues r nt paid fr 2 months (60 days), dn it's categorizd as sma type 2.
now, dues r nt paid fr 3 months (90 days), dn it wd be, dn it wd be c/a npa type 1 (substandard asset)
not paid fr 1 year, dn it wd be c/a np2 (doubtful asset).
if it's nt paid fr mr thn 2 years, dn it wd be c/a npa-3 (loss asset).
npa- if principl r intrst nt paid fr mr thn 90 days.
once loan s categorizd as npa type 3, dn logicl nxt step s t recognize ds loss & writ off loss.

### double financil repression
[[double financial repression]] (4.03 pm)
npas creates problm wch s c/a double financil repression.
loans (assets o bank) r xpectd t earn intrst whreas n deposits (liabilty o bank) intrst has t be paid.
loan dt ws givn becomes npa. intrst s no longr earnd. ∴, dr s inc n provisionng requirements.
∴, abilty t lend mr mny decr., asset side s repressng now b/c loan o 1 customr has bcm npa.
liabilities remn intact. fm both assets & liabilities sides, bank s stressd.
### twin balnc sheet
