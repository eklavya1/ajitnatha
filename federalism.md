Federalism is a system of government in which the power is divided between a central authority and various constituent
units of the country.
Usually, a federation has two levels of government.
One is the government for the entire country that is usually responsible for a few subjects of common national interest.
The others are governments at the level of provinces or states that look after much of the day-to-day administering of their
state.
Both these levels of govemments enjoy their power independent of the other.
The exact balance of power between the central and the state govemment varies from one federation to another.
This balance depends mainly on the historical context in which the federation was formed.

There are two kinds of routes through which federations have been formed.
The first route involves independent States coming together on their own to form a bigger unit so that by pooling
sovereignty and retaining identity they can increase their security.
This type of **'coming together'** federations include the USA, Switzerland and Australia.
In this first category of federations, all the constituent States usually have equal power and are strong vis-å-vis the federal
government.

The second route is where a large country decides to divide its power between the constituent States and the national
government.
India, Spain and Belgium are examples of this kind of **'holding together'** federations.
In this second category, the central government tends to be more powerful vis-å-vis the States.
Very often different constituent units of the federation have unequal powers. Some units are granted special powers.

There are two or more levels (or tiers) of government.

 Different tiers of government govem the same citizens, but each tier has its own jurisdiction in specific matters of legislation, taxation, and administration.

The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specified in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government are constitutionally guaranteed.

The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government. Such changes
require the consent of both levels of government.

Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different levels of government. The highest court
acts as an umpire if disputes arise between different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers.

Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specified to ensure its financial autonomy

The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote the unity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity.
