- the persian gulf (persian: خلیج فارس, romanized: xalij-e fârs, lit. 'gulf of fars', pronounced [xæliːdʒe fɒːɾs]), sometimes called the arabian gulf (arabic: اَلْخَلِيْجُ ٱلْعَرَبِيُّ, romanized: al-khalīj al-ˁarabī), is a mediterranean sea in western asia. the body of water is an extension of the indian ocean located between iran and the arabian peninsula. it is connected to the gulf of oman in the east by the [[strait of hormuz]]. the shatt al-arab river delta forms the northwest shoreline.
- the persian gulf has many fishing grounds, extensive reefs (mostly rocky, but also coral), and abundant pearl oysters, but its ecology has been damaged by industrialization and oil spills.
- the persian gulf is in the persian gulf basin, which is of cenozoic origin and related to the subduction of the arabian plate under the zagros mountains. the current flooding of the basin started 15,000 years ago due to rising sea levels of the holocene glacial retreat.
