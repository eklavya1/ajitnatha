A brief review of the previous class

## GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE
GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE [1:10 PM]

Green House Effect: Trapping of long-wavelength (Infrared) radiation by Green House Gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere
GHGs:
CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFC, PFCs, O3, and water vapor
Green House cause warming of Earth.
Global Warming: the slow rise of the average temperature of the earth's surface due to GHGs; results in Climate Change.
Climate Change: changes in climatic conditions due to the warming of the earth.
Global Warming Potential (GWP)
GWP of any GHGs =  
Global warming caused by 1 tonne of Green House Gas / global warming caused by 1 tonne of CO2
Methane is a short-lived climate pollutant because it gets oxidized into CO2 and Water

## Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC)
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC) [ 1:41 PM ]

Formed in 1988 by a resolution passed by UNGA
Formed by 2 organizations: UNEP and WMO ( World Meteorological Organisation )
Objective/Mandate: to carry out an assessment of climate change and impacts and bring about an “Assessment Report” on climate change.
Also brings a comprehensive report on climate change for policymakers.
Total 6 reports have been brought about by IPCC so far.
AR1-1990
AR2-995
AR3-2001
AR4-2007
AR5-2014
AR6-021
All these reports set the ground at the global level to take actions to fight climate change.
It gives a scientific basis and predicts the consequences.
Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to IPCC

## Effects of Climate Change
Effects of Climate Change [1:53 PM]
Climate Change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale.
Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly.
The General effects of climate change are
Extreme weather events (flood droughts, famines, Hurricane Tornado)
Sea-level Changes (coastal and island floodings and submergence)
Agricultural impacts
Forest impacts
Impacts on Oceans (acidification, coral bleaching,)
Health impacts(death due to heatwaves, disease, zoonotic disease)

International effort to fight climate change
International effort to fight climate change

UNFCCC (UN framework convention on climate change)
Adopted in 1992 under Agenda 21 during Rio Earth Summit (UN Conference on Environment and Development) in Rio-de-Janeiro, Brazil
Objectives:
To limit the temperature rise of the earth’s surface below 2degree Celsius from the Pre-industrial level by the end of 2100 degrees Celsius.
To develop mitigation and adoption strategies to fight climate change.
To provide climate finance and transfer of technology by Developed Industrial countries (Annex 1 ) to developing countries (Annex 2)
3 guiding principles:
Historical Responsibility
Common but Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR)
Loss and Damage Principle

Two Agreements under UNFCCC

Kyoto Protocol 

Paris Agreement 

Adopted in 1997, Kyoto, Japan and ratified in 2005
	

Adopted in COP 21- Paris Summit and was ratified in 2016

Came into effect in 2005
	

Came into effect post- 2020

2 commitment periods with legally binding targets to Annex-I countries only

KP-1 (2008-2012) :-  5% reduction was target based on 1990 emission

KP-2 (2013-2020):-18%
	

1st implementation period (contributions) from 2021 to 2030 based on Nationally determined Contributions of all Annex-1 and non-Annex countries

Top-down Approach
	

Bottom-up Approach

Climate finance of 100 billion USD, Green Climate Fund from Annex-I countries to Non-Annex I Countries
	

Additional climate Finance of 100 Billion USD from 2021 to 2025 by Annex-I countries to Non-Annex I countries

## CLIMATE CHANGE AND INDIA
CLIMATE CHANGE AND INDIA [3:20 PM]

India acted quickly to the Climate change and responded positively enacted “ The National Action Plan on Climate Change ”(NAPCC)
India enacted Eight National Missions:
National Solar Mission
The mission is made up of 3 phases,
Phase 1 – 2012 – 13
Phase 2 – 2013 – 17
Phase 3 – 2017 – 22
Targets
Install 1,00,000 MW of solar power by 2022.
40 GW rooftop and 60 GW through large and medium scale grid-connected solar power projects.
To achieve 15 million sq meters of solar thermal collector area by 2017 and 20 million by 2022.
To deploy 20 million solar lighting systems for rural areas by 2022.
National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency
Bureau of Energy efficiency: 5 start rating of electrical appliances
National Mission on Sustainable Habitat
TERI 5 star rating system for green building (GRIHA- Green Rating or Integrated Habitat Assessment)
National Water Mission
National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem
Green India Mission
Forestation  and Reforestation
REDD+: reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; people’s participation
National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture
Climate-smart agriculture
National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change
Funding for scientific research on climate change

## INDIA’s INDC
INDIA’s INDC

Reducing Emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - To reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from the 2005 level.
Increasing the Share of Non-Fossil Fuel Based Electricity - To achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with the help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF).
Enhancing Carbon Sink (Forests) - To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.
Technology Transfer and Capacity Building
Adaptation
Mobilizing Finance

## CARBON MARKET
CARBON MARKET [4:04 PM]

Trading of certificates based on  reduction of GHGs expressed on Gigatonnes Carbon dioxide equivalent--> Special Carbon Market
3 carbon Market Mechanism:
1. Emission Trading Scheme
Also called as Carbon Trading System
A company that reduces carbon emission  get tradeable carbon unit
The minimum price of the carbon units fixed by UNFCCC
2. Clean Development Mechanism
An environment-friendly or climate-friendly project e.g. Solar power Park in a developing country (Non-Annex country ) is certified as a CDM project by a National CDM Authority in terms of reduced carbon emission units called Certified Emission  Reduction (CER) units.
Annex-I country invests in this CDM Project o meet Kyoto targets by receiving CER units.
3. Joint Implementation
A clean or climate-friendly project in a developed country (Annex-I) e.g Waste to Energy plant funded jointly  by a group of developed countries (Annex-I) to meet their Kyoto Targets
