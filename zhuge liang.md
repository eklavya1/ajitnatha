- zhuge liang (chinese: 諸葛亮; 181–234), courtesy name kongming, was a chinese statesman and military strategist. he was chancellor and later regent of the state of shu han during the three kingdoms period. he is recognised as the most accomplished strategist of his era, and has been compared to sun tzu, the author of the art of war. his reputation as an intelligent and learned scholar grew even while he was living in relative seclusion, earning him the nickname "wolong" or "fulong", meaning "crouching dragon" or "sleeping dragon". zhuge liang is often depicted wearing a taoist robe and holding a hand fan made of crane feathers.zhuge liang was a confucian-oriented "legalist". he liked to compare himself to the sage minister guan zhong, developing shu's agriculture and industry to become a regional power, and attached great importance to the works of shen buhai and han fei, refusing to indulge local elites and adopting strict, but fair and clear laws. in remembrance of his governance, local people maintained shrines to him for ages. his name has become synonymous with wisdom and strategy in chinese culture. zhuge liang is depicted in the wu shuang pu (無雙譜, table of peerless heroes) by jin guliang.
