# SUMMARY
- None of the Indian soil is rich in nitrogen. ^cfef13

- Iron is rich in two kinds of soils i.e.
	- [[red soil]] and [[laterite soil]].
- Humus (organic matter) is rich in three kinds of soils:
	- forest soil, peaty soil, and black soil. #pneumonic _RBLSMP_
# Red soil
- Region: southern Karnataka, Interior Andhra Pradesh, eastern Madhya Pradesh, a major part of Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, and Orissa, parts of northeast India.
- Climate: moderate to low [[precipitation]].
- Parent [[rock]]s are [[granite]] and [[gneiss]].
- Rich in Iron, aluminum, and magnesium. #pneumonic _Fe Al Mg_
- Deficient in nitrogen, hummus, phosphorus, and lime. #pneumonic _N hummus P lime_
# black soil
- origin is basaltic in nature.
- Regions: Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, southern Gujrat, western Madhya Pradesh, and parts of Telangana.
- Black color due to the presence of _titaniferous magnetite_.
- Rich in humus but deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus.
- It is also called _self-plowing soil_ as it forms cracks when it is dry and becomes sticky when wet. #pre 
# Laterite soil
- Regions: western side of [[western ghats]], parts of Orissa and Meghalaya, hills of central India, parts of Aravallis.
- Climatic conditions:
	- very high precipitation with some dry conditions.
- It is rich in Iron and Aluminium.
- it is deficient in bases like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, hummus(get decomposed easily due to high temperature), phosphate, and calcium.
- It is acidic in nature and more suitable for plantation crops.
# Alluvial soil
- Regions: entire northern plains and coastal plains.
- There are no marked differences in layers (as newly formed)
- They are deficient in nitrogen and hummus.
- They are very fertile in nature.
# Saline soil/arid soil
- It requires more [[evaporation]] than [[precipitation]].
- The salinity is due to the capillary action that brings bases on the surface.
- Due to high evaporation and low moisture content saline salts get accumulated in the top layer.
- It is found in [[rajasthan]] and northern Gujarat.
# Forest soil/mountain soil:
- The soil is very thin in nature.
- It is rich in organic matter.
- It is acidic in nature.
- Region: found in the Himalayas, parts of western ghats and Vindhyas, etc.
# Peaty soil
- It is found in the region submerged in water for some period of time. _related_ [[solifluction]]
- it is rich in organic matter.
- It is also saline in some regions.
- Regions: coastal regions of West Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nadu. ^2583df

# Soil erosion
- The removal of a top fertile layer of soil leading to loss of fertility is called soil erosion.
- Causes:
	- Natural causes:
		- wind and water action.
	- Anthropogenic activities:
		- Deforestation.
		- Overgrazing.
		- Shifting cultivation.
		- Mining activities.
		- Use of chemical fertilizers over a longer period of time.
		- Faulty irrigation practices.
## Type of soil erosion:
-  #pneumonic _srgs_
- Sheet erosion: washing of the top layer of the soil.
- Rill erosion: simple cracks are formed.
- Gully erosion. when [[rill]]s are enlarged then they become gully.
- Slip erosion: when the entire top layer is washed.
- The regions with high soil erosion: 
	- Himalayas:
		- due to high slop, deforestation, and high human activities. _related_ [[soil]]
	- Cental India:
	- ]chamal ravines(a bigger version of the gully) also known as badland topology.
	- Rajasthan:
		- due to winds.
	- Western ghats:
		- very high rainfall and humans activities.
	- North-east region:
		- shifting cultivation most common reason.
	- Punjab, Haryana, western-UP:
		- due to faulty irrigation practice.

# Economic geography

## Ocean resources
- Types of oceanic resources:
-  #pneumonic _m e fo fr_
### Mineral:
- The minerals which are dissolved in the oceanic water: different types of salts like sodium, chlorine, bromine, etc
- The minerals that are deposited on the continental shelf: sand (the most important mineral), gravels, pearls, phosphorite, pacers deposits (gold most important).
- The minerals that are deposited on the ocean floor:
	- Polly metallic nodules:
		- They are aggregates of various minerals especially metals.
		- They are mainly rich in manganese.
		- Also rich in iron, nickel, copper, cobalt, gold, and silver.
	- Polly metallic sulfides:
		- Found in the region of volcanic eruptions.
		- They are rich in sulfur, copper, lead, zinc, etc. 

### Energy:
- Oil and Gas:
	- when the zooplankton and algae die they get buried on the continental shelf and becoming fossils over the years. example Bombay high, Persian gulf, north sea.
- Coal:
	- formed due to the burial of vegetation on the continental shelf.
- _Monazite_ found in the coastal soil is rich in _thorium_. #pre 
- Deuterium.
- Tidal energy.
- Wave energy.
- OTEC(ocean thermal energy conversion): use the temperature difference between surface and deep ocean.
- Wind energy: wind is faster on the surface than on the land.
### Food
- Includes fish, prawns, crabs, seaweed, etc.
### Freshwater
- Obtained through desalinization of seawater.
- There are two methods: reverse osmosis and electrolysis.
- But these methods are very costly and produce heat which causes thermal pollution. thus not widely used.
- Fish resources.
# Issues with the ocean resources
- they are not uniformly distributed.
- the Polly metallic nodules are not distributed widely thus it becomes unviable to extract them. 
- Only a few regions where there is a high concentration of Polly metallic nodules like:
- [[Clarion clippertol zone]]. #doubt
- Peru basin.
- Near cook islands.
- There are a lot of environmental issues associated with ocean resource extraction.
- There are technological hurdles to the extraction of ocean resources. _related_ [[=unrivaled]] | [[geopolitics]] | [[tony stark|innovation]] 
- The cost of [[resource]] extraction is very high as compared to that of land.
- geographical limitations are also there for resource extractions.
# India and ocean resources
## Deep ocean mission
- It is a 5-year mission started in 2018 with an allocation of 8000 crore rupees 
- Its objective is to develop technology related to deep-sea mining, underwater vehicles, desalinization plants, and climate change advisory service.
## Fish resources
- These are mainly found on the continental shelf.
- Major finishing banks are located in temperate regions.
- The conditions favorable for fish banks are:
	- Where the warm and ocean current meets. for example near the japan coast.
	- Coldwater upwelling. for example near Peru cold current.
	- Shallow and wide continental shelf.
	- Habitation provided by coral reefs.
	- The famous fishing banks are the Grand bank, Dogger bank, George bank in the Atlantic ocean.
	- Favorable conditional for fishing industries:
		- Broken coastline: provide harbor for ships.
		- Rugged interior land: create demand for fishing.
		- Moderate temperature: it reduces the decomposition of fish.
## Forest resources
- traditional provided the wood for boats.
- The tropical reasons do not have a well-developed fish industry due to the following reasons:
- High temperature - It does not support the growth of planktons.
- High temperatures are not suitable for fish preservation.
- Causes high diversity of fish, many of them not consumable.
- The infrastructure is not well developed in the tropical regions (mostly developing countries)
- Less demand as high agriculture productivity.
## The fishing industry of India
- The potential of fishing in India:
	- [[india]] has a 7500 km long coastline. _related_ [[constantinople]]
	- India has a very high number of rivers and streams.

- *The barriers to the fishing industry in India:*
	- The cultural habit of vegetarianism leads to low demand. _related_ [[vegetation]] 03:27 PM 28/9/2021
	- Fishing remains a caste-based occupation. _related_ [[caste system]]
	- Manual boats are used for fishing.
	- Geographical limitations like monsoon and cyclones.
	- Low [[infrastructure]] due to low [[investment]].
	- Territorial issues and bilateral issues for example [[india]]-[[sri lanka]].
	- The various measures by the Indian [[government]] for promoting fishing:
### Blue revolution
- It was part of the 5th and 6 five years plans.
- It had 2 stages:
	- Ist stage (1980-1991) and 2nd stage([[1991]]-[[2005]]).
- The objective was to double both inland and marine production.
- Fish Farmers Development Agency (FFDA) were established to promote fish [[production]]
- The national fish development board was established in [[2006]].
- The National Policy on Marine Fisheries [[2017]] to promote fisheries in India.
- Mission Neel Kranti([[2015]]-2020): for promotion of inland and marine fisheries.
- Matsya Sampada Yojana(2020): focused and sustainable [[development]] of fisheries sector in the country.

The topic for the next class: the water resources in India.
