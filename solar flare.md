A solar flare is a sudden flash of increased brightness on the Sun, usually observed near its surface.
It is defined as a sudden, rapid, and intense variation in brightness.
It occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atrnosphere is suddenly released.
Magnetic reconnection is a process where opposite polarity magnetic field lines connect and some of the magnetic energy is converted to heat energy and also kinetic energy which leads to the generation of heating, solar flares, solar jets, etc.
Solar flares are classified into three categories according to their brightness in the x-ray
wavelengths.
X-class flares are big; they are major events that can trigger radio blackouts around the whole world and long-lasting radiation storms in the upper afrnosphere.
M-class flares are medium-sized; they generally cause brief radio blackouts that affect Earth's Polar Regions- Minor radiation storms sometimes follow an M-class flare.
C-class flares are smaller events as compared to X- and M-class events with few noticeable consequences here on Earth.

A solar flare is an intense localized eruption of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere. Flares occur in active regions and are often, but not always, accompanied by coronal mass ejections, solar particle events, and other solar phenomena.

Solar flares occur in a power-law spectrum of magnitudes; an energy release of typically 1020 joules of energy suffices to produce a clearly observable event, while a major event can emit up to 1025 joules.

Although originally observed in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, especially in the H-alpha emission line of hydrogen, they can now be detected from radio wave to gamma-ray radiation.

Flares also occur on other stars, where the term stellar flare applies.
