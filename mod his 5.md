## sikh state
(01:03 pm)
### reasons for animosity b/w sikh & mughal:
- [[1675]]= 9th guru teg bahadur executed by aurangzeb  b/c of increasing resistance of sikhs.
- anandpur under shiwalik hills chiefs (allies of mughals) desired by guru gobind singh & to achieve this he formed khalsa army  (1699).
- khalsa is a military organization to defend sikh panth from mughals.
- [[1707]]= post aurangzeb's death, guru gobind singh met bahadur shah who agreed to give anandpur but then never implemented decision.
- [[1708]]= guru gobind singh murdered in a conspiracy.
- post murder of guru gobind singh, banda bahadur ([[1708]]-15) led a revolt & created his own principality around patiala.
- why banda bahadur was defeated in [[1715]]:
- divide & rule of jahandar & farruksiyyar.
- jahandar shah introduced ijaradari system to influential khatri traders becoming ijaradars.
- jahandar shah & farruksiyar gave mansabs to khatris.
- some important jats like churaman switched sides.
- [[1716]]= banda bahadur executed by faruksiyar.
### post-1716
- [[1716]]
- sikh polity came to be dominated by misls- horizontal structure developed in sikh polity.
- each misl has its own army; each misl was headed by sikh sardar (misl chief); each misl was kinship-based.
- in times of war, misls will come together & fight, for ex, in [[1765]], ahmad shah badali again attacked, misls came together & defeated him. in [[1799]], zaman shah attacked but he was also defeated by misla.
- reward to soldier post victory in any battle= land in proportion to their contribution.
### ranjit singh:
- main role in defeating [[zaman shah]] was of ranjit singh of sukherchakiya misl.
- [[1809]]= treaty of amritsar- british recognized ranjit singh as a sovereign ruler.

## jat kingdom of bharatpur
(01:55 pm)
- churaman jat founded it by using discontent among peasantry.
- surajmal ([[1756]]-63) consolidated power & forced mughals to recognize him. he supported marathas in 3rd battle of panipat.
- surajmal tried to implement military reforms. also, tried to implement mughal revenue system & tried to remove kins from court.
- his death in [[1763]] led to collapse of jat state.

## afghan kingdoms in north
- (01:57 pm)
- afghans migrated to [[india]] since [[15th century]] & participated in [[military]] labor markets of north.
- sher shah suri ([[1540]]-45) was afghan ruler of lodhi dynasty who consolidated afghan tribes.
- attack by nadir shah to defeat mughals.
- kingdom of [[rohilkhand]] was established by ali md. khan in himalayan foothills.
- [[farrukabad]] established east of delhi by [[bangash pathans]].

## rajputs
(02:02 pm)
- rajputana was divided into many small kingdoms like marwar, mewar, etc.
- rajputs were also participating in military labor market.
- akbar realized that they are militarily powerful & try to get their support by building alliance, giving them mansabs, recognizing them.
- many rajput chiefs were given a high rank in mughal army. here a quid pro quo developed- rajput chiefs strengthened mughal empire by giving it military strength & mughals helped rajput chiefs consolidate control over their ruled territory.
- ∴, rajput chiefs having more land became too powerful vis-a-vis those who had lesser land. former were closer to mughals & established centralized rule by suppressing smaller rajput chiefs.
- marwar & mewar rebelled against aurangzeb  b/c of their selfish power interest.
- 1680-81= rajput revolted against aurangzeb.
- [[1700]]s = with weakening of mughal empire, rajput chiefs gradually loosened ties with mughals to be independent in practice. main player here was sawai jai singh of amber.
- [[1750]]s = rajputs were attacked by marathas & afghans but they could not be subjugated permanently.

## mysore
- (02:31 pm)
- [[mysore]] was a part of vijayanagar empire ([[1330]]s- [[1640]]s).
- [[1500]]s= under wodeyar dynasty, mysore emerged as autonomous state.
- 1670s-[[1704]]= chikka deva raja established a strong central govt in mysore. but then decline of wodeyar dynasty began & by [[1760]], real power came into hands of prime minister nanjaraj, while wodeyar dynasty became a puppet.
- hyder ali ([[1761]]-82):
- he came from a humble background.
- he was part of a mysore military & has risen in military hierarchy/ranks over time.
- overthrew corrupt nanjaraj & wodeyar dynasty & established his own dynastic rule. --> like [[chandragupta maurya]] v/s nanda ???
### role of hyder ali in establishing a strong mysore state:
- responsible for establishing a strong & modern army for mysore-
	- took help of french for modern technology & training.
	- would personally choose head of each risalas as army was divided into risalas (a unit of army). each risala was a self-contained unit with each having its own weapons, ammunition, transport, supplies, etc.
	- he consolidated political power by subjugating local warrior chiefs, deshmukhs, poligars (landowners who considered themselves autonomous since vijayanagar empire era). hyder brought countryside under his strict control which was earlier dominated by poligars.
## tipu sultan 1782 - 1799
- [[1782]]-[[1799]]
- he built upon work of hyder ali.
### land revenue model-
- introduced direct collection of taxes by state officials by getting rid of intermediaries like zamindars, revenue farmers. this led to decline in power of intermediaries & ∴ increase in revenue & control of state. this is how mysore is diff from awadh, bengal, hyderabad.
- tipu's policies are c/a as [[military fiscalism]] i.e. focus on maximizing revenue collection for its use in development of strong military.
- he did a detailed land survey to assess land revenue demand on peasants.
- land under jagirdari was minimal.

- to maximize land revenue- he built dams for irrigation facilities, gave tax breaks (i.e. low or no tax to be paid) to those who did land reclamation (bringing barren land into cultivation), introduction of sericulture & promoted other cash crops, he protected peasants from corruption & oppression of tax officials & eve enemies of tipu agreed that rural population was most prosperous in mysore.
- sent ambassador to france for import of foreign technology for military.
- he built a modern navy with help of france as he wanted to participate in oceanic trade.
- he built 30 trading centers in & outside mysore, including in muscat (in oman).
- he also set up a psu i.e. a state commercial cooperation that set up above trading centers.

### result:
- dreams were larger than resources & constant warfare amongst neighbors (hyderabad, marathas, travancore) & east india company drained wealth & mysore failed.
- reason for wars= mysore wanted to dominate whole of south india. 
- mysore's policies & goals were very similar to that of english east india company-
- both wanted domination of south.
- both wanted to maximize profits from trade.
- both wanted to develop a strong military.
- mysore was building a modern strong state.
- ∴, mysore was main threat to EIC in south. through 4 mysore wars ([[1766]]-69, [[1780]]-84, 89-92, 17 99), EIC finally ended this threat.

## travancore
(03:48 pm)
- was always autonomous, independent from mughals.
- important ruler was martanda verma, who was responsible for establishing a strong centralized state by subjugating local chiefs.
- he developed a modern west-like army. in [[1741]], they removed dutch from cochin.
- he did nationalization of pepper trade i.e. introduced state monopoly over pepper trade, ∴, state earned trade profits.
- later introduced state monopoly overall trade in malabar coast.
- trade profits were deployed for irrigation, transport, etc.
- political decline during rama verma ([[1758]]-98):
- art & culture flourished during his age.

- [[1789]]= mysore attacked again.
- 800]]= british resident stationed in court.
- [[1805]]= signed subordinate alliance with british.
- in [[1809]], there was a revolt by diwan vellu thampi against british eic's interference in internal affairs of travancore. this revolt was crushed by eic. however, diwan vellu thampi is celebrated as a national hero today.
 
- topic for next class= advent of europeans, east india company.
