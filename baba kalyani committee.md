baba kalyani led committee was constituted by ministry of commerce & industry to study existing sez policy of india & had submitted its recommendations in november [[2018]].
an sez is a territory within a country that is typically duty-free (fiscal concession) & has different business & commercial laws chiefly 
to encourage investment & create [[employment]].
sezs are created also to better administer these areas, thereby increasing ease of doing business.
asia's first epz (export processing zones) was established in 1965 at kandla, gujarat.
while these epzs had a similar structure to sezs, govemment began to establish sezs in [[2000]] under foreign trade policy to redress infrastructural & bureaucratic
challenges that were seen to have limited success of epzs.
special economic zones act was passed in [[2005]]. act came into force along with sez rules in [[2006]].
however, sezs were operational in india from 2000 to 2006 (under foreign trade policy).
india's sezs were structured closely with china's successful model.
presently, 379 sezs are notified, out of which 265 are operational. about 64% of sezs are located in five states â€” [[tamil nadu]], [[telangana]], [[karnataka]], [[andhra pradesh]], & [[maharashtra]].
board of approval is apex body & is headed by secretary, department of commerce (ministry of commerce & industry).
