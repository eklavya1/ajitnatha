## soil pollution
It is the degradation of land due to the disposal of waste on land.
Any substance (solid, liquid or gaseous) that is discharged, emitted or deposited in the environment in such a way that it alters the environment causes land pollution
### Effects of Soil Pollution
It is another form of land pollution, where the upper layer of the soil is damaged.
This is caused by the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
This leads to the loss of fertile land. Pesticides kill not only pests but also human beings.
land when contaminated with toxic chemicals & pesticides lead to problem of skin cancer &  human respiratory system.
toxic chemicals can reach our bodies through foods vegetables.
Landfills & waste dumping lead to air pollution.
abnormal toxic substances spread in atmosphere cause transmit respiratory diseases among the masses.
animal kingdom has suffered most in past decades.
They face a serious threat with regards to loss of habitat & natural [[environment]].
The constant human activity on land is leaving it polluted, forcing these species to move farther away.
Sometimes several species are pushed to the verge of extinction or disappear due to no conducive environment.
