# principle of natural justice
- æ™‚ - `01:46 PM 26/7/2021`
- [[maneka gandhi vs uoi, 1978]]
- [[principle of natural justice]]
	- no bias on part of decision
	- no bias on part of adjudicating body - ie no person cannot be a judge in his own case (lol of course)
- `procedure estd by law` (uk concept)
- `due process of law` (american concept)


-  in [[ak gopalan vs state of madras]], court held that concept of procedure estd by law was deliberately introduced into indian constitution (02:00 PM 26/7/2021). court held that PEBL (procedure estd by law) meant procedure as laid down in law as enacted by legislature & nothing more.
-  court held that ind constitution had adopted english concept in preference to that of american one.
-  there is no guarantee in constitution against arbitrary legislation encroaching upon personal liberty & life of persons. thus if a competent legislation enacts a law providing a procedure to deprive a person of its life & liberty, validity of a law cannot be challenged in a court on grounds that law itself is unjust , unfair & unreasonable.
-  in [[ak gopalan vs state of madras]], SC took a narrow interpretation of [[a21 ddd]] & held that foll test would be used to determine constitutionality of a law that deprives a person of his lfie & liberty ðŸ—½under a21-
	1.  there should be a law enacted by a competent legislature
	2.  law should provide a procedure
	3.  procedure should have been followed
-  why constitution makers did not adopt concept of `due process of law` ?
		-  constitution makers were clear about implementation of land reforms, agricultural reforms, social reforms, etc.if concept of due process of law would have been adopted, many litigations would have come up against laws enacted by legislature, thereby making process of reforms difficult.
- it may not be corret to assume that a21 was rendered useless by court after ak gopalan judgement-
		- despite judgment a21 continued to serve as a restrain on executive action. no doubt court could not judge constitutionality of law enacted by legislature but it could restrain executive from depriving a person of his life & liberty if there was no sanction of law ie a person could not be deprived of his life & liberty merely by executive action without existence of a valid law to support it

# maneka gandhi case
- æ™‚ - `02:24 PM 26/7/2021`
- [[maneka gandhi vs uoi, 1978]]
		- in this case, her passport was impounded & she was restrained from travelling outside india, she petitioned in court that her personal liberty & right to life have been violated by state because of arbitrary action of state. she contended that she was not given a fair opportunity to present her case, therefore leading to violation of [[principle of natural justice]]. she contended that there is a close relationship b/w a14,19,21 & any article 21 should pass test of a14,19. she contended that term law in a21 does not simply mean enacted law, rather law should follow principles of natural justice as well as be reasonable as per a19
- judgment in maneka gandhi case
		- court laid down a number of principles that made a21 much more meaningful, it was held that a14,19,21 are not mutually exclusive & judgement in ak gopalan is `erroneous`, court held that right to life doe not mean mere animal existence, rather it includes all rights that are needed to make a person's life meaningful & worth living.
		- SC gave expansive meaning to term `personal liberty` & held that all attempts should be made to expand meaning & reach of [[fundamental rights]]. court held that it would also look into whether law was just fair & reasonable under a21
		- as a result in maneka gandhi case, sc ended up reading into constitution concept of `due process of law`
