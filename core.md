crust is outermost solid part of earth. thickness of crust varies under oceanic and continental areas.
oceanic crust is thinner as compared to continental crust.
continental crust is thicker in areas of major mountain systems. it's as much as 70 km thick in himalayan region.

mean thickness of oceanic crust is 5 km whereas that of continental is around 30 km.
asthenosphere refers to upper portion of mantle, not crust.
mantle lies below crust.
upper portion of mantle is c/a asthenosphere.
word 'astheno' means weak. it's considered to be extending up to 400 km.
it's main source of magma that finds its way to surface during volcanic eruptions.
lower mantle, which is in a solid-state, extends beyond asthenosphere.
crust and uppermost part of mantle are c/a lithosphere. its thickness ranges from 10-200 km.
outer core is in a liquid state while inner core is in a solid-state.
core is made up of very heavy material mostly constituted by nickel and iron. it's sometimes referred to as 'nife' layer.
core-mantle boundary is located at depth of 2,900 km.
