international relations class 11

class started at 1:26 pm

india bangladesh relation (1:27 pm)-  ganga river water agreement.
india bangladesh relation (1:27 pm)-  ganga river water agreement.

this treaty has established a 30-year water-sharing agreement & recognized bangladesh as lower riparian country.
this treaty was necessitated by commissioning of farraka barrage in 1975 to divert water from ganges to its distributory hugli to maintain navigability of calcutta port.
this agreement was entered into to save a hydro political impasse that 2 countries were getting into.
this agreement is valid for dry season from january till may of a year.
as per treaty -
availability at farakka  	share of india 	share of bangladesh 
 if flow of water more than 75000 cusec  	45000 cusec 	rest to bangladesh 
75000-70000 cusec 	rest with india  	35000 cusec
less than 70000 cusec  	35000 cusec 	35000 cusec
however, bangladesh is unhappy with treaty.
reasons -
it claims that agreement is based on outdated hydrological data & river flow rarely crosses 70,000 to 75,000 cusec during lean season.
studies have shown that post this treaty bangladesh did not receive its guaranteed share during critical dry periods 65% of time.
in any case, distribution of river water based on volumetric allocation misses on multidimensionality of flow.
in reductionist approach where flow is quantified as volume of water passing by a specific point per unit of time along its course.
this point is farakka barrage in this case.
such approach compromises ecological services offered by river.
since political leadership is well entrenched in 2 countries eminent expiry day of treaty presents opportunity to explore appropriate mechanisms for improvement over current river water sharing agreement b/w 2 countries.

teesta river water dispute - 2:19 pm
teesta river water dispute - 2:19 pm
teesta river originates in sikkim & flows through west bengal before entering  bangladesh.
it's a tributary of river brahmaputra.
importance of river teesta -
its floodplains cover 14% of total cropped area of bangladesh providing livelihood opportunities to 73% of its population.
it covers nearly floodplains of sikkim.
teesta is lifeline of 1/2 a dozen districts in north bengal.

agreement on river water sharing - (2:25 pm)
agreement on river water sharing - (2:25 pm)
it has been mired in conflict since 1947 when catchment areas of river were allotted to india.
under 1972 treaty b/w india & bangladesh, india bangladesh joint river commission was set up.
an ad-hoc arrangement on sharing teesta waters was made in 1983.
adhoc arrangement -
india would receive 39% of river water &  bangladesh would receive 36 % of it & remaining 25 % would flow freely.
upa govt proposed interim deal with respect to teesta river waters.
india agreed to share 37.5% while retaining 42.5% of waters during lean season b/w december & march.
interim agreement was to be valid for 15 years however deal could not be concluded due to opposition from west bengal govt .
2015 visit of pm modi to bangladesh generated expectation of signing deal, however, there has been no progress with respect to it.
demand of bangladesh -
it insists on equitable sharing of river teesta.
stand of india-
since majority of river's watershed & length lie in india bangladesh cannot insist on equitable sharing.
however, given importance of teesta for agrarian economy of bangladesh, india has agreed to near equitable sharing with bangladesh.
cm of west bengal was explicit in her opposition to deal when she commented that " while she would want its bangladeshi brethren to get water from teesta but problem is its water supply has gone down".
many of glaciers on teesta river have retreated  b/c of global warming so much so that average flow of river during lean season b/w october to april/may is about 500 million cubics per month.
however, bangladesh claims that building of dams along teesta in sikkim has resulted in lean seasonal flow draining into bangladesh.
china angle- (2:44 pm)
there have been reports suggesting that bangladesh is discussing almost 1 billion dollar loan from china for a comprehensive management & restoration project on river teesta.
it would aim to manage teesta river basin efficiently controlling floods, avoiding droughts, & tackling water crisis.
way forward-
given genuine demand of bangladesh & in spirit of gujral doctrine india should agree to equitable sharing of river.
it will augment india's soft power in bangladesh help address big power small power syndrome which marks india's relation with saarc countries.
it will give a push to pro-india sheikh hasina govt which has been responsible for assuring sonali adhyaya in bilateral relations.
 in fact, it will cement india's position as all-weather friend of bangladesh & in due course of time generate overall consensus in bangladeshi society & politics with respect to a partnership with india.
after land boundary agreement, it's this teesta water-sharing agreement that will be remembered as a part of golden chapter in bilateral relationship.

west bengal & treaty -(2:54 pm)
west bengal & treaty -(2:54 pm)
under article 253 of indian constitution has right to conclude water-sharing treaties on trans boundary rivers.
however, it can do so after consulting with necessary states & stakeholders.
with respect to interstate water disputes, central govt sets up tribunals but for disputes involving transboundary rivers b/w 2 countries, a stalemate has continued as evidenced by river teesta.
it's eg of conflictual federalism.
west bengal govt has proposed sharing of river water of torsa, manshai, dhansai, & sangkosh rivers rather than teesta river.
concerns of india -

china in bangladesh (3:02 pm)
china in bangladesh (3:02 pm)
to ensure trade benefits using bangladeshi ports.
to keep growing india in check.
china established diplomatic relations with bangladesh in 1976.
in 2016 2 countries have entered into a strategic partnership.
india aims to deepen its relationship with south asian countries which positively correlates with bangladesh's look east policy.
it has been specially designed to reduce dhaks dependence on new delhi & it opens up avenues of cooperation with chain & southeast asia.
rising concerns in bangladesh over citizenship amendment act of india seem to have pushed consensus in dhaka towards china.
defense cooperation- china is only country with which bangladesh has a formal defense cooperation agreement.
 china is biggest supplier of arms to bangladesh.
break at 3:20 pm to 3:40 pm
reasons-
bangladesh was earlier was part of pakistan hence its acquaintance with chinese weapons.
 tade & investment- bangladesh have joined bri.
china is developing a megacity near dacca & building airport in sylhet region.
china has granted duty-free access to 97% of bangladeshi products.
china replaces india bangladesh's largest trading partner .
bangladesh has requested infrastructure fund worth 64 billion dollars.
people to people ties- china has offered medical supplies during covid pandemic to bangladesh.
china has requested to form sister city alliances with chinese cities.
growing china bangladesh relations have raised concerns in india.
to assuage indian concerns bangladeshi pm during 1 of her visits to china clarified that dacca's relation with india is unique" they share a bond engrained in blood. their creation is organic & cannot be compared with any other country".
on other hand, china is a partner in megaprojects & for economic engagements.
radicalization of bangladeshi society -
radical groups like jamat e islami, huji, huji-b pour anti-india sentiments in bangladesh.
india fears that such radical views might spill cross border into india radicalizing its own youth.
illegal immigration- india's mexico problem
illegal migration into india is not unique to bangladesh.
from other south asian countries as well illegal migration into india takes place.
however, what is unique is intensity of such illegal migration into india.
acc to some estimates 40 million bangladeshi are illegally living in india.
reasons -
porous borders are marked by rivers, dense habitations, & forests on either side.
cross border kinship relations.
shared cultural & linguistic ties.
corruption in law enforcement agencies on borders.
poverty in bangladesh.
poor living conditions.
lack of alternative livelihood opportunities.
concerns-
 places constraints on already limited resources of india.
there is a fear of demographic inversion given scale of illegal migration. eg tripura
more often than not these illegal migrants get themselves enlisted on to voter list & participate in national & state elections.
in fact, it has been alleged that since they serve as important voting banks state & central govt have failed to act against them.
but problem with them getting enlisted on voter rolls is that non-indian citizens gain a say in democratic policy-making of country.
rise in criminal activity & consequent violence.
rise in xenophobia.

steps taken by goi-(4:10 pm)
steps taken by goi-(4:10 pm)
while bangladeshi govt has never had active policy encouraging illegal migration into india, it fails to recognize & accept that such movements occur across india bangladesh border.
illegal migration tribunal determination tribunal act- this act provided for establishment of tribunals to identify & adjudge illegal migrants from bangladesh.
however, since bangladeshi govt doesn't accept these people as their own they languish in detention centers in india only to be consequently released.
 lining india bangladesh with live barbed wires- this only has served to increase hurdle of move across border but couldn't kill motivation to cross into india.
therefore migration continued.
children & cattle have fallen victim to such steps across border.
such indian initiatives violate international law of ensuring necessary stretches of no man's land across border on both sides given population density on either side of borders.
suggestions -
apart from addressing various facilitative factors leading to illegal migration in india such as corruption in law enforcement agencies etc india should issue work permits to bangladeshi on annual basis.
it will help india regulate number of bangladesh entering into country & prevent them from interfering in democratic process of country.
it's out of box solution.
india already absorbs people from nepal.
india is a large economy that can offer predecided economic opportunities to bangladesh people.
this will in turn substantially augment india's soft power.
