This school is famous for its special style of decorative paintings.
It is the native art form of Tanjore city of Tamil Nadu.
A style of painting characterised by bold drawing, techniques of shading and the use of pure and brilliant colours flourished at Tanjore in South India during the late 18th and 19th centuries.
These paintings are unique as they are mostly created on glass and board instead of cloth and vellum preferred in North India.
They are also unique because of the use of brilliant colour patterns and the liberal use of the gold leaf.
They use many types of gemstones and cut glasses for embellishments to create larger than life images.
Most of the paintings depict smiling Krishna in various poses and various major events in his life.
These paintings reached their Zenith under the patronage of Sarfoji Maharaj who was a great pattem of arts.
Currently, the school is still operational but they have moved towards experimenting with diverse subjects like birds animals buildings.
