During the 1870s and 1880s, large parts of Eastern Bengal witnessed agrarian unrest caused by the oppressive practices of Zamindars.
The zamindars resorted to enhanced rents beyond legal limits and prevented the tenants from acquiring occupancy rights under Act X of 1859.
To achieve their ends, the zamindars resorted to forcible evictions, seizure of cattle and crops, and prolonged, costly litigation in courts where the poor peasant found himself at a disadvantage.
The peasants of Yusufshahi Pargana in Patna district formed an agrarian league or combination to resist the demands of the zamindars.
The league organized a rent strikeâ€”the ryots refused to pay the enhanced rents, challenging the zamindars in the courts. Funds were raised by ryots to fight the court cases.
The struggles spread throughout Patna and to other districts of East Bengal.
The main form of struggle was that of legal resistance; there was very little violence.
The government also promised to undertake legislation to protect the tenants from the worst aspects of zamindari oppression.
In 1885, the Bengal Tenancy Act was passed.
Several young Indian intellectuals supported the peasants' cause. These included Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, R.C. Dutt, and the Indian Association under Surendranath Banerjee.
