the black sea is a marginal mediterranean sea of the atlantic ocean lying between europe and asia.
the black sea is bordered by six countries.
o it is bordered by ukraine to the north, russia to the northeast, georgia to the east, iurkey to the south, and bulgaria and romania to the west. hence, only 1, 2, 3 and 5 are correct.
the roughly oval-shaped black sea occupies a large basin strategically situated at the southeastern extremity of europe but connected to the distant waters of the atlantic ocean by the bosporus strait(which
emerges from the sea's southwestem comer), the sea of marmara, the dardanelles, the aegean sea, and the mediterranean sea.
to scientists, the black sea is a remarkable feature because its lower levels are, to all intents and purposes, almost biologically dead—not because of pollution but because of the continued weak ventilation of the
deep layers.

the black sea is a marginal sea of the atlantic ocean lying between europe and asia. it is bordered by bulgaria, georgia, romania, russia, turkey, and ukraine.
it is supplied by major rivers, principally the danube, dnieper, and don.
the black sea ultimately drains into the mediterranean sea, via the turkish straits and the aegean sea. the bosporus strait connects it to the small sea of marmara which in turn is connected to the aegean sea via the strait of the dardanelles.
to the north, the black sea is connected to the sea of azov by the kerch strait.
the black sea covers 436,400 km2 (not including the sea of azov), making it the *world's largest inland body of water*.
