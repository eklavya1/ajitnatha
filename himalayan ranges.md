tationom lower to higher altitude
1. Deciduous forests
2. Wet temperate forests
3. Grassland pastures
4. Mosses and Lichens

himalayan ranges show a succession of vegetation from tropical to tundra, which changes with altitude.
deciduous forests are found in foothills of himalayas.
it's succeeded by wet temperate type of forests b/w altitude of 1 m.
in higher hill ranges of northeastern india, hilly areas of west bengal & uttaranchal, evergreen broadleaf trees such as oak & chestnut are predominant.
between 1 ,500-1 ,750 m, pine forests are also well-developed in this zone, with chir pine as a very useful commercial tree.
deodar, a highly valued endemic species grows mainly in westem part of himalayan range.
deodar is a durable wood mainly used in construction activities.
similarly, chinar & walnut, which sustain famous kashmir handicrafts, belong to this zone.
blue pine & spruce appear at altitudes of 2,225-3,048 m.
at many places in this zone, temperate grasslands are also found.
but in higher reaches, there is a transition to alpine forests & pastures.
silver firs, junipers, pines, birch, rhododendrons, etc. occur b/w 3,000-4,000 m.
however, these pastures are used extensively for transhumance by tribes like gujjars, bakarwals, bhotiyas, & gaddis.
southern slopes of himalayas carry a thicker vegetation cover because of relatively higher precipitation than drier north-facing slopes.
at higher altitudes, mosses & lichens form part of tundra vegetation.

series of several parallel or converging ranges.
ranges are separated by deep valleys creating a highly dissected topography [(of a plateau or upland) divided by a number of deep valleys].
southern slopes have steep gradients & northern slopes have comparatively gentler slopes. [scaling mount everest is less hectic from northern side. but china puts restrictions so climbers take steeper southern slopes from nepal]
most of himalayan ranges fall in india, nepal, & bhutan.
northern slopes are partly situated in tibet (trans-himalayas) while western extremity lies in [[pakistan]], [[afghanistan]], & [[central asia]].
himalayas b/w tibet & ganga plain is a succession of 3 parallel ranges.
