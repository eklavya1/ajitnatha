Social forestry means the management and protection of forests and afforestation on barren lands with the purpose of helping in the environmental, social and rural development.

The National Commission on Agriculture ([[1976]]) has classified social forestry into three categories -
	**Urban forestry, Rural forestry and Farm forestry.**
Agro-forestry is the raising of trees and agriculture crops on the same land inclusive of the waste patches. Hence statement 2 is incorrect.
o It combines forestry with agriculture, thus, altering the simultaneous production of food, fodder, fuel, timber and fruit.
Community forestry involves the raising of trees on public or community land such as the village pasture and temple land, roadside, canal bank, strips along railway lines, and schools etc.
Farm forestry is a term applied to the process under which farmers grow trees for commercial and non-commercial purposes on their farm lands.
