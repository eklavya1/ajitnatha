cremated in a huge funeral pyre. The wives of the dead climbed upon the pyre and were burnt with the corpses of their men. This custom, called sati by the Indians, was still being practised in India until the British (who called it suttee) put an end to it in the colonial era.62 Against this background, some key elements of the accepted story of Buddha’s early life can be questioned. First, it is clear that the story of Buddha being raised in luxury by his warrior chief father cannot be true. The kshatriya regarded luxury as a sin. If Buddha had been raised in this manner, he would never have been able to become a warrior, which, of course, would have made it impossible for him to succeed his father. Second, it is also clear that as the oldest son of a kshatriya aristocratic family and the son of an Aryan chief, Buddha must have been trained from childhood as a soldier, as all Aryan males of his caste were and as the texts tell us he was. He would have had no real choice in the matter. Third, had he failed to meet the warrior standard, he would have been relegated to a life of obscurity and never anointed as his father’s heir, nor would the sangh have permitted it. Fourth, during Buddha’s life northeast India was wracked by frequent wars. While Buddha was still alive, the [[shakya clan]] republic was attacked and its entire population massacred and we hear no more of the people which produced the greatest of the Indians.

- Dynamics of Psychiatric Collapse in War There is no good reason to believe that soldiers in ancient times were any less fearful of dying or being maimed than today’s soldiers. Whether in ancient or modern times, exposure to the stress of war is likely to seriously affect one’s sanity and ability to function normally in society.75 It is, then, not unlikely that Buddha’s exposure to violence and slaughter might have seriously affected his mental condition. — location: [1978]()

---
The stresses of war impose terrible burdens on the physiology and psychology of most human beings. Humans are equipped with the normal physiological mechanisms of any animal that prepare the body to deal with and survive under stress. Under stress, the body automatically reacts. The soldier’s blood pressure rises; the heart beats rapidly; the body begins to sweat; muscles tense increasing short-term strength; the mind races and the endocrine system activates all the biological mechanisms that contribute to increased sensory awareness. Once the soldier perceives danger, few have any control over the onset of these physical reactions. Only when the danger has passed does the body’s biological system gradually return to normal. — location: [1982]()

---
The military environment itself is a sensory universe of stressors: the sight of the dead or mutilated bodies; loss of comrades; the screams of the wounded; the sounds of the dying; the odour of decayed flesh; the guilt that comes with killing or having survived when others were killed, are but a few things that cause a soldier stress. Other physical factors such as inadequate nutrition, hunger, thirst, dehydration, heat, cold, wet weather, minor injuries caused by poor equipment (blisters from poorly fitting boots and packs, etc.), lack of sleep; fatigue from marching, carrying weapons, tents etc; and the anticipation of battle, all work to increase the stress on the soldier’s physiology.76 Even after the battle, the body will maintain itself in a high state of physiological tension for a considerable period. If the stress is prolonged, say a few days, the biological systems that sustain the physiology of stress will remain aroused and unable to return to normal. A soldier in this state will eventually collapse from nervous exhaustion. — location: [1989]()

debilitation — location: [1998]()

---
The desire to survive is so deeply embedded in our genetics and evolutionary experience as to be self-evident. When confronted with the face of death from which there seems no escape, few soldiers can retain their sanity. The onset of a soldier’s mental debilitation can be rapid or gradual. When the onset is rapid, the condition is referred to as ‘battle shock’; when it is gradual, it is called ‘combat fatigue’. In general, about fifty per cent of all psychiatric casualties develop debilitating symptoms in less than five days’ exposure to military action. — location: [2003]()

There was another factor, however, that suggests that the stress suffered by ancient soldiers was considerably greater. All the killing in ancient battles was done with muscle-powered weapons inflicted upon the victim at close range, so that the slayer directly witnessed the fate of the slain, a fate he caused with his own hands. — location: [2054]()

Among the most dramatic of Buddha’s actions was his repudiation of his identity as a kshatriya warrior, perhaps realizing that being a warrior was at the root of his difficulties. Immediately upon leaving the palace, Buddha cut off the top-knot of his hair, a distinguishing mark of his warrior caste status, and threw away the uniform that identified him as a soldier. — location: [2082]()

---
As if to make his point more strongly, Buddha donned the saffron robe worn by condemned criminals on their way to execution. This ‘identification with the damned’ speaks strongly to what may have been Buddha’s sense of guilt, either for having survived when others had died (survivor guilt) or for having killed other human beings. — location: [2094]()

Even elements of the monastic organization followed the military model. For example, the title for the second-in-command and director of monastic training was the senapati, the same title as the secular king’s chief military advisor and field commander. Perhaps it was Buddha’s military training and status as a kshatriya that so shaped his personality that even when it led to the often terrible experiences of war, he could not, once he recovered from his psychological condition, bring himself to completely abandon his former life. The result is the paradox of a religion strongly rooted in the condemnation of war that encourages its members to acquire and follow many of the habits and practices of soldiers. — location: [2131]()

As it was, Buddha died in 483 BC, at about the age of 80. The circumstances of his death remain somewhat suspicious, however, and Buddhist tradition suggests that murder cannot be entirely ruled out. Buddha visited the town of Kushingara and took to sleeping in a grove. A blacksmith named Chunda came to him and offered to feed him. This in itself was not unusual since monks routinely received food from people who offered it to gain merit. The texts tell us that Buddha ate the meal at Chunda’s house and immediately became violently ill and died.88 The suddenness with which he was stricken and succumbed suggests the possibility of poisoning. If Buddha was poisoned, the most likely suspect again was Vidudabha. — location: [2146]() ^70ca1c

laceration — location: [2155]()

---
Modern medical analysis, however, suggests that Buddha may have died from mesenteric infarction, a condition accompanied by acute abdominal pain and the passage of blood, symptoms attributed to Buddha in the Pali Canon and commonly found among the elderly. Mesenteric infarction is caused by an obstruction of the blood vessels of the mesentery, that part of the intestinal wall that binds the intestinal tract to the abdominal cavity, and results in a laceration of the intestinal wall.89 The condition causes massive blood loss and is usually lethal. If the modern medical analysis is correct, Buddha died a natural death from old age. — location: [2152]()

But Muhammad was more than a great field general and tactician. He was also a military theorist, organizational reformer, strategic thinker, operational level combat commander, political-military leader, heroic soldier, revolutionary, inventor of the theory of insurgency and history’s first successful practitioner. Muhammad had no military training before actually commanding an army in the field. — location: [2168]()

The Land of Arabia The — location: [2172]()

The Arabs call their land Jazirat al-Arab, the ‘island of the Arabs’, and it is indeed an island surrounded on three sides by water and by sand on the fourth. The land is harsh and until modern times, when armies could take advantage of motorized transport, history knew of no invader who had succeeded in penetrating the country’s sandy barriers to establish a permanent presence in the land. The ground is comprised of a single uniform bloc of ancient rock called the Arabian Shield, and is made up mostly of desert and steppe. The climate is uniformly hot, dry and harsh, receiving only 6 inches of rain per year. There are no permanent rivers anywhere in Arabia. — location: [2173]()

In the harsh land of the Hijaz only the Bedouin was truly at home. Those who lived in the oases or the few towns often had to hire Bedouin guides to travel from one place to another or hire them as caravan guards to ensure a safe journey. — location: [2205]()

---
The heat, trackless roads, lack of food, scarcity of water and the general discomfort of life in the desert, while problematic during times of peace, became the allies of the Bedouin in times of war. His daily ration of dates, camel milk and water would bring any other army to its knees in a few days but the Bedouin could subsist on this diet forever. — location: [2207]()

Most Bedouin were desperately poor and were almost always on the brink of malnutrition. In times of drought or starvation, it was not an uncommon practice to bury their female babies alive in order to free up resources for the surviving adults. Moreover, spending long days watching animals graze made for stultifying boredom. It is not surprising that the ghazw or raid became a way of Bedouin life. — location: [2218]()

The Arabs of Muhammad’s time lived in a harsh society in a harsh land. There were few laws and no institutions to afford justice or restrain violence. Only the blood feud and its threat of retaliation against a wrongdoer provided a rough balance of power to limit violence. Blood feuds were not to be taken lightly, since the feud did not end until the wrongdoer was dead or some member of his tribe had been killed as compensation. Later, it became a common practice to limit the feud by paying the blood wit (diya), financial compensation usually in the form of a number of camels, to the person or clan against whom the wrong had been committed. This aside, anyone outside the clan remained without moral standing. When Muhammad divided the ethical world between believers and unbelievers in which the latter might rightly be enslaved or even killed by the former, he was only extending the practice of the blood feud to religion. The religious community of believers, to which absolute loyalty was owed and outside of which there were no obligations, replaced the old clan community of blood and kin. — location: [2241]()

By the time of Muhammad’s birth, Mecca’s location as a stopping and transfer point for the north-south trade route between the coastal ports and Gaza had led to the growth of a merchant class.

His reputation for honesty served him well, and he was made responsible for selling some of the goods as well as the purchase of some return goods. The caravan belonged to a rich widow of the Quraish tribe named Khadijah. The death rate among Arab men from disease, injury and blood feuds left Mecca with a considerable number of widows, among them a few who had property and considerable wealth.8 Khadijah was one of these. Khadijah’s assignment of her caravan to Muhammad was apparently a testament to his merchant skill and honesty. Upon Muhammad’s return to Mecca, Khadijah proposed marriage. Muhammad was 25. Khadijah was already twice widowed, and said to have been about 40 years old, but may have been somewhat younger, since she bore him several children, four girls and two boys, although some sources (Seyyid Hossein Nasr) say Muhammad had only one son.9 — location: [2292]()

In 620 Muhammad preached to a group of seven pilgrims from the oasis of Yathrib (Medina). The next year these seven returned bringing with them five more to hear his message. Muhammad met with the group in a little valley in the mountains outside Mecca at a place known to the locals as Aqaba. Here the pilgrims from Yathrib were converted to Islam. Along with a number of moral maxims that they agreed to obey, the new converts pledged to obey Muhammad and recognized him as the Messenger of God. In the history of Islam this pledge is called the First Pledge of Aqaba. However, the pilgrims did not undertake any obligation to take up arms in defence of Islam or to use force to protect Muhammad himself. The following year, 621, a larger group of pilgrims from Medina, seventy-three men and two women, arrived and met with Muhammad at Aqaba and converted to Islam. This is called the Second Pledge of Aqaba, and it is a very important event in the history of Islam. Unlike the first pledge, the converts swore an oath to protect Muhammad as they would their own family members, with force if necessary. The leader of the group, Al-Bara, swore that ‘we will protect you as we protect our women. We give our allegiance and we are men of war possessing arms which have been passed from father to son.’24 Muhammad replied, ‘I am of you and you are of me. I will war against them that war against you and be at peace with those at peace with you.’25 The pledge at Aqaba was a traditional Arab oath of obligation requiring mutual armed assistance. But Muhammad promised the new converts, known now as the Ansar or Helpers, something which no traditional clan chief could have offered: everlasting life in paradise. — location: [2380]()

Muhammad had only one wife, his beloved Khadijah. After her death at 62, he had twelve others. He had six children by his first wife, but no children by the twelve who followed, although all were still of child-bearing age. He did, however, father a son with Mariya, an Egyptian Coptic Christian concubine given him as a gift, but who never became his wife.29 Nearly all of Muhammad’s later wives were widows. Perhaps he preferred the company of mature women to young girls; perhaps these older women reminded him of his own mother who died when he was 6. Muhammad must have been a very psychologically complex person. Whatever glimpses into his psychology may be gained from historical accounts must be regarded as fraught with error. The preeminent scholar W. Montgomery Watt, drawing on Ibn Ishaq’s notes, offers the following description of Muhammad’s general psychological disposition. — location: [2424]()

---
For a man of such rectitude, Muhammad seems to have possessed an acute sensitivity to personal ridicule. He hated poets and song-singers who were the primary means of spreading political propaganda and unkind portrayals of the enemies of the people that had hired them. In a society where honour meant as much as life, a man’s reputation was sacred. Hiring a poet to travel about and ridicule a man was serious business indeed. — location: [2465]()

Muhammad’s hatred of poets was almost irrational in its intensity. As a poor orphan, Muhammad must have been regularly subject to insults and taunts by others, and it is possible that his hatred of poets was rooted in this early childhood experience. — location: [2473]()

Although his reforms and military achievements give him much in common with the greatest generals in history, Muhammad was not a conventional field general. He was, instead, a new type of warrior, one never before seen in antiquity. Muhammad was first and foremost a revolutionary, a fiery religious guerrilla leader who created and led the first genuine national insurgency in antiquity that is comprehensible in modern terms, a fact not lost on the jihadis of the present day who often cite the Qur’an and Muhammad’s use of violence as justification for their own. Unlike more conventional generals, Muhammad’s goal was not the defeat of a foreign enemy or invader, but the replacement of the existing Arabian social order with a new one based upon a radically different ideological view of the world. — location: [2501]()

---
To achieve his revolutionary goals, Muhammad utilized all the means recognized by modern analysts as characteristic of and necessary to a successful insurgency. Although Muhammad began his struggle for a new order with a small guerrilla cadre capable of undertaking only limited hit-and-run raids, by the time he was ready to attack Mecca a decade later that small guerrilla force had grown into a large conventional armed force with integrated cavalry and infantry units capable of conducting large-scale combat operations. It was this conventional military instrument that Muhammad’s successors used to forge a great empire. It was the first truly national military force in Arab history. — location: [2507]()

---
Muhammad’s rise to power was a textbook example of a successful insurgency, indeed the first such example in antiquity of which I am aware. Modern insurgents like Mao Tse Tung, Ho Chi Minh, Jomo Kenyatta, Fidel Castro and, perhaps, George Washington would easily have recognized Muhammad’s strategy and methods in their own revolutionary struggles. The West has been accustomed to thinking of the Arab conquests which followed Muhammad in purely conventional military terms. But the armies that achieved those conquests did not exist in Arabia before Muhammad. It was Muhammad’s successful unconventional guerrilla operations, his successful insurgency, that brought those armies into existence. Thus the later Arab conquests, as regards both strategic concept and the new armies as instruments of military method, were the consequences of Muhammad’s prior military success as the leader of an insurgency. — location: [2519]()

---
The first requirement for an insurgency to succeed is a determined leader whose followers regard him as special in some way and worthy of their following him. In Muhammad’s case, his charismatic personality was enhanced by his deeply held belief that he was indeed God’s Messenger, and that to follow Muhammad was to obey the dictates of God himself. — location: [2529]()

---
This aspect of Muhammad’s military life as a guerrilla insurgent is likely to strike the reader as curious and, as such, is worth exploring in some detail. If the means and methods used by modern military analysts to characterize insurgency warfare are employed as categories of analysis, it is clear that Muhammad’s campaign to spread Islam throughout Arabia fulfilled each of the analytical criteria. The first requirement for an insurgency to succeed is a determined leader whose followers regard him as special in some way and worthy of their following him. In Muhammad’s case, his charismatic personality was enhanced by his deeply held belief that he was indeed God’s Messenger, and that to follow Muhammad was to obey the dictates of God himself. — location: [2526]()

---
Insurgencies require an armed force and the manpower to sustain them. It was from the original small cadre of guerrillas that the larger conventional army could be grown, the force that would ultimately permit the insurgency to engage its enemies in set-piece battles when the time and political conditions were right. Muhammad may have been the first commander in history to understand and implement the doctrine that General Vo Nguyen Giap of North Vietnam later referred to as ‘people’s war, people’s army’.39 Muhammad established the idea among his followers that God had commandeered all Muslims’ purposes and property for His efforts, and that all Muslims had a responsibility to fight for the faith. Everyone, men, women and even children, had an obligation for military service in defence of the faith and the ummah that was the community of God’s chosen people on earth. If this is not properly understood, then it will be difficult to grasp that it was the attraction of the ideology of Islam more than anything else that attracted the manpower that permitted Muhammad’s small revolutionary cadre to grow into a conventional armed force capable of large-scale engagements. — location: [2552]()

---
Muhammad’s ability to obtain sufficient weapons and equipment had another important advantage. Many of the insurgency’s converts came from the poorest elements of the Bedouin clans, people too impoverished to afford weapons and armour. Muhammad supplied these converts with expensive military equipment, immediately raising their status within the clan and guaranteeing their loyalty to him, if not always to the creed of Islam. In negotiations with Bedouin chiefs, Muhammad often made them gifts of expensive weaponry. Several pagan clans were won over to Muhammad’s insurgency in this manner, although they did not convert to Islam. Horses and camels were equally important military assets, for without them raids and the conduct of operations over distances were not possible. Muhammad obtained his animals in much the same manner as he did his weapons and with equal success. At Badr the insurgents had only two horses. Six years later at Hunayn, — location: [2578]()

---
An insurgency must also be able to sustain the popular base that supports the fighting elements. To accomplish this, Muhammad changed the ancient customs regarding the sharing of booty taken in raids. The chief of a clan or tribe traditionally took one quarter of the booty for himself. Muhammad decreed that he receive only one fifth, and even this he took not for himself but in the name of the ummah. Under the old ways, individuals kept whatever booty they had captured. Muhammad required that all booty be turned in to the common pool where it was shared equally among all combatants who had participated in the raid. Most importantly, Muhammad established that the first claimants on the booty that had been taken in the name of the ummah were the poor and the widows and orphans of the soldiers killed in battle. He also used the promise of a larger share of booty to strike alliances with Bedouin clans, some of whom remained both loyal and pagan to the end, fighting for loot instead of the faith. Muhammad’s later military successes against towns, oases, and caravans provided an important source of wealth to supply the insurgent popular base with the necessities of life. — location: [2585]()

Within a year of Muhammad’s death (632), many of the clans that had sworn allegiance to Islam recanted, resulting in the War of the Apostates. It was the military brilliance of Muhammad’s generals and the superior combat capabilities of his new army that made it possible for Islam to defeat the apostates and force them back into the religious fold. These same generals commanded the new Arab armies that made possible the Arab conquests of Persia and Byzantium. The old Arab way of war would have had no chance to win against the armies of either of these empires. In this sense, Muhammad’s military revolution was an event that shook the ancient world, and changed history by creating the means that made the Arab conquests possible. — location: [2745]()

---
Muhammad’s successful transformation of Arab warfare marks him as one of the great military reformers of all time. Muhammad stands in good company with those whose military reforms made possible the creation of empires by their successors. Kamose of Egypt led the fight against the Hyksos occupiers, reforming the Egyptian army and making it possible for Thutmose III to create the Egyptian empire of the New Kingdom. Philip II of Macedon completely changed the manner of Classical Greek warfare, forging a military instrument with which he united all Greece and which his son, Alexander the Great, used to create the empire of the Hellenes. The reforms of Augustus [[caesar]] created the professional Roman army, making possible the expansion of the Roman Empire to its greatest geographical extent. And it was Muhammad who reformed Arab warfare and fashioned the military instrument his successors used to establish the great Empire of Islam. — location: [2750]()

Muhammad was the first to introduce the notion of war for strategic goals to the Arabs. — location: [2840]()

---
Muhammad’s ultimate goal, the transformation of Arab society through the spread of a new religion, was strategic in concept. His application of force and violence, whether unconventional or conventional, was always directed at the strategic goal. Although Muhammad began as an insurgent, he was always Clausewitzian in his thinking in that the use of force was seen not as an end in itself, but as a tactical means to the achievement of strategic objectives. Muhammad was the first Arab commander to use military force within a strategic context. Had he not introduced this new way of thinking to Arab warfare, the use of later Arab armies to forge a world empire would not only have been impossible; it would have been unthinkable. — location: [2841]()

---
Experienced Combat Officer Corps: As an orphan, Muhammad lacked even the most rudimentary military training provided by an Arab father. Probably to compensate for this deficiency, he surrounded himself with other men who were experienced warriors. He constantly asked questions of these more experienced soldiers and frequently took their advice. He frequently appointed the best warriors of his former enemies to positions of command once they had converted to Islam. — location: [2856]()

---
Logistics and Force Projection: Muhammad seems to have had the caravaneer’s concern for logistics and planning, an expertise that permitted him to project force and carry out operations over long distances across inhospitable terrain. Muhammad had been an organizer of caravans for twenty-five years before he began his insurgency. During that time he made several trips to the north along the spice road. He gained a reputation for honesty and as an excellent administrator and organizer of caravans. Planning a caravan required extensive attention to detail and knowledge of routes, rates of march, distances between stops, water and feeding of animals, location of wells, weather, places of ambush etc, knowledge that served him well as a military commander. — location: [2876]()
