lichen can survive on almost any surface without [[soil]]

- A lichen ( LY-kən, also UK:  LICH-ən) is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species in a mutualistic relationship. Lichens have properties different from those of their component organisms. They come in many colors, sizes, & forms & are sometimes plant-like, but are not plants. They may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose); flat leaf-like structures (foliose); crust-like, adhering tightly to a surface (substrate) like a thick coat of paint (crustose); a powder-like appearance (leprose); or other growth forms.A macrolichen is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy; all other lichens are termed microlichens. Here, "macro" & "micro" do not refer to size, but to the growth form. Common names for lichens may contain the word moss (e.g., "reindeer moss", "Iceland moss"), & lichens may superficially look like & grow with mosses, but they are not related to mosses or any plant.: 3  Lichens do not have roots that absorb water & nutrients as plants do,: 2  but like plants, they produce their own nutrition by photosynthesis. When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites, but instead use the plant's surface as a substrate.

- Lichens occur from sea level to high alpine elevations, in many environmental conditions, & can grow on almost any surface. They are abundant growing on bark, leaves, mosses, or other lichens & hanging from branches "living on thin air" (epiphytes) in rain forests & in temperate woodland. They grow on rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, exposed soil surfaces, rubber, bones, & in the soil as part of biological soil crusts. Different kinds of lichens have adapted to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: arctic tundra, hot dry deserts, rocky coasts, & toxic slag heaps. They can even live inside solid rock, growing between the grains.

- It is estimated that 6–8% of Earth's land surface is covered by lichens. There are about 20,000 known species. Some lichens have lost the ability to reproduce sexually, yet continue to speciate. They can be seen as being relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems, where the fungi, algae, or cyanobacteria have the potential to engage with other microorganisms in a functioning system that may evolve as an even more complex composite organism. Lichens may be long-lived, with some considered to be among the oldest living things. They are among the first living things to grow on fresh rock exposed after an event such as a landslide. The long life-span & slow & regular growth rate of some species can be used to date events (lichenometry).
