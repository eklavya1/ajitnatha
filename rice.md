Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or less commonly Oryza glaberrima (African rice). The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.

As a cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for over half of the world's human population, especially in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize. Since sizable portions of sugarcane and maize crops are used for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important food crop with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.

The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound irrigation planning but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.

Rice, a monocot, is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide. Production and consumption of rice is estimated to have been responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010.

It is the staple food crop of a majority of the people in India-
Our country is the second-largest producer of rice in the world after China.
It is a Kharif crop that requires high temperature, (above 250C) and high humidity with annual rainfall above 100 cm-
It is the most water-intensive; producing a kilogram of rice requires an average of 2,800 litres of water
In areas with less rainfall, it grows with the help of irrigation- Rice is grown in the plains of north and north-eastem India, coastal areas, and the deltaic regions.
The development of a dense network of canal irrigation and tubewells have made it possible to grow rice in areas of less rainfall such as Punjab, Haryana and westem Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Rajasthan.

rice is a staple food for overwhelming majority of population in india.
though it's considered to be a crop of tropical humid areas, it has about 3,000 varieties that are grown in diff agro-climatic regions.
these are successfully grown from sea level to about 2,000 m altitude & from humid areas in eastern india to dry but irrigated areas of punjab, haryana, 
western u.p. & northern rajasthan.
in southem states & west bengal, climatic conditions allow cultivation of 2 or 3 crops of rice in agricultural year.
india contributes 21.9 per cent of rice production in world & ranked 2nd after china in 2017.
about one-fourth of total cropped area in country is under rice cultivation.
west bengal, uttar pradesh, & punjab are leading rice-producing states in country.
yield level of rice is high in punjab, tamil nadu, haryana, andhra pradesh, telangana, west bengal & kerala.
in 1st 4 of these states almost entire land under rice cultivation is irrigated.
