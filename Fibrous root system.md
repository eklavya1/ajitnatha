- It is composed of large numbers of roots nearly equal in size; root systems of this type are found, for example, in the grasses.
- It is the characteristic feature of monocotyledonous plants which include cereal, crops, com, etc.
- It is a network of small thin roots extending not deep into the soil, mainly close to the surface.
Prop root system
- these roots develop from the branches of the tree, hang downwards, and penetrate into the ground thereby supporting the tree.
ex - Roots of the Banyan tree and Rubber plant.

A fibrous root system is the opposite of a taproot system. It is usually formed by thin, moderately branching roots growing from the stem.  A fibrous root system is universal in monocotyledonous plants and ferns. The fibrous root systems look like a mat made out of roots when the tree has reached full maturity.

Most trees begin life with a taproot, but after one to a few years change to a wide-spreading fibrous root system with mainly horizontal surface roots and only a few vertical, deep anchoring roots. A typical mature tree 30â€“50 m tall has a root system that extends horizontally in all directions as far as the tree is tall or more, but well over 95% of the roots are in the top 50 cm depth of soil.

A few plants with fibrous root systems:



Coconut palm

Grass

RosemaryFibrous roots grow fairly close to the surface of the ground.

Leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.

Forages have a fibrous root system, which helps combat erosion by anchoring the plants to the top layer of the soil, and covering the entirety of the field, as it is a non-row crop. In a fibrous root system, the roots grow downwards into the soil, and also branch off sideways throughout the soil. This forms a mass of fine roots, with no distinct tap root, because the embryonic root dies back while the plant is still young and growing.
