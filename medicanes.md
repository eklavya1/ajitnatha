Medicanes are tropical-like cyclones formed over the Mediterranean Sea.
The Mediterranean is a generally dry, evaporative sea and cyclonic storms don't grow as much rain and can be hard to detect
They can occur any time of the year but tend to peak during the fall Iwinter months-
Medicanes occur more in colder waters than tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons-
Like tropical storms, medicanes have a symmetric structure, a warm core, a clearly visible eye, and winds of at least tropical-storm strength.
Medicanes are typically smaller in diameter and have lower wind speeds than true tropical cyclones.
Recently, a medicane was recorded from September 14th — 20th, 2020, flooding parts of Greece-


Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones, often referred to as medicanes (a portmanteau of Mediterranean hurricanes) but sometimes also as Mediterranean cyclones or as Mediterranean hurricanes, are meteorological phenomena occasionally observed over the Mediterranean Sea. On a few rare occasions, some storms have been observed reaching the strength of a Category 1 hurricane, on the Saffir–Simpson scale, and one storm has been recorded reaching Category 2 intensity. The main societal hazard posed by medicanes is not usually from destructive winds, but through life-threatening torrential rains and flash floods.

The occurrence of medicanes has been described as not particularly rare. Tropical-like systems were first identified in the Mediterranean basin in the 1980s, when widespread satellite coverage showing tropical-looking low pressures which formed a cyclonic eye in the center were identified. Due to the dry nature of the Mediterranean region, the formation of tropical, subtropical cyclones and tropical-like cyclones are infrequent and also hard to detect, in particular with the reanalysis of past data. Depending on the search algorithms used, different long-term surveys of satellite era and pre-satellite era data came up with 67 tropical-like cyclones of tropical storm intensity or higher between 1947 and 2014, and around 100 recorded tropical-like storms between 1947 and 2011. More consensus exists about the long term temporal and spatial distribution of tropical-like cyclones: they form predominantly over the western and central Mediterranean Sea while the area east of Crete is almost devoid of tropical-like cyclones. The development of tropical-like cyclones can occur year-round, with activity historically peaking between the months of September and January, while the counts for the summer months of June and July are the lowest.
