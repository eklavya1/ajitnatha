`western reg`
	raj
	guj
	maharashtra
	
south reg
`karnataka`
	rapid urb
	plateau reg abs less water, less [[percolation]]
	also rain shadow because of western ghats
	pollution
	mining

`northeast`
	only reg where there is not water scarcity
	will happen soon though !
	deforestation

sikkim has connectivity only with west bengal state.
meghalaya only has connectivity with assam.
bhutan shares a boundary with sikkim, west bengal, assam, & arunachal pradesh.

then uk is 45 degrees from hp.
then a tank-like formation for nepal.
bhutan is a small tank than nepal.
then a curve for arunachal pradesh.
then come down till tropic of cancer but don't touch it for manipur.
then a curve around tropic of cancer for tripura.
then west bengal is a straight line down.
then orissa & andhra pradesh's line is at angle.
then again bit straight for tamil nadu.
for west coast take line till tropic of cancer.
always draw andaman & nicobar & lakshadweep with india map.

water resources.
fish resources.

# water resources of india
(1.50 pm)

[[earth]] water: 97% saline & only 3 % freshwater.
freshwater: 68.7% in ice cap & 30 % groundwater & 0.3% in surface water.
surface water: 87% in lakes, 11% in swamps, 2% in rivers.
there are nearly 10,000 rivers in india.
scarcity of water in india is due to `mis` management of water resources. _related_ [[quotes#^f1f954]]

# problem associated with water resources of india
## geographical reasons:
physiography:
- [[rajasthan]]: [[aravali range]] parallel to monsoon winds.
- [[tamil nadu]]: parallel to [[bay of bengal]] branch of monsoon.
- _rainshadow regions_ of interior peninsular.
- [[ladakh]]: [[himalaya]] prevents monsoon winds from reaching there.
- nature of [[monsoon]]:  delay, disruption, & break in monsoon.

## nature of indian drainage system.
- man-made reasons
	[[water]] demand is increasing while supply decreasing of quality [[water]].
- [[pollution]] of water resources.
	mis[[management]] of water like faulty [[irrigation]] practices: free electricity, water-intensive crops, etc.
increase in population & urbanization.
unsustainable extraction of groundwater:
	for ex in water scare interior maharashtra groundwater extraction for sugarcane(water-intensive) cultivation.
deforestation: it reduces groundwater recharge.
global warming & climate change.
inter-state rivers disputes. for ex [[cauvery river]], [[krishna river]], [[godavari river]], etc. these disputes prevent [[distribution]] of [[river]] water.

# water stress
[[water stress]]
(2.19 pm):
- it's defined as _availability of water per person_.
- [[falken mark index]] gives status of water stress from diff countries. it measures water stress in terms of water/person/year. #pre 
- if a country's water availability is _less than 1700 m3/person/year then it's a water stress country._
- india's water availability was 1500 m3/person/year in [[2011]].
- if a country reaches a level of less than 1000 m3/person/year then it becomes a water scare country.
- water stress & scarcity in india:
	- [[india]] is 13th most water scare county in world.
	- 54% of india faces high to extremely high water stress.
- in northern parts of [[india]]:
	- includes #pneumonic _hujl_
		- [[himachal pradesh]],
		- [[uttarakhand]],
		- [[jammu & kashmir]],
		- [[ladakh]].
- reasons:
	- [[deforestation]], [[pollution]].
	- faulty [[irrigation]] practice & water-intensive crops.
	- high [[population]] & high demand from urban areas
- in western parts of india:
	- includes [[gujarat]], [[rajasthan]], [[maharashtra]], western part of [[madhya pradesh]].
- reasons:
	- [[rajasthan]] & [[gujarat]]: mainly geographical conditions.
	- western madhya parish: increase in deforestation & remain [[shadow]] effect of western ghats.
	- maharashtra: faulty irrigation practices.
- in southern parts of india : _related_ [[south india]]
	- includes [[karnataka]], [[andhra pradesh]], [[telangana]], [[kerala]], [[tamil nadu]].
reasons:
	- rain shadow effect. _related_ [[rain-shadow region]] | [[umbra]]
	- plateau region: less [[percolation]] of water & no major river available.
	- rapid urbanization like in [[bangalore]], [[hyderabad]], [[chennai]], etc.
- in eastern part of india:
	- includes bihar, west bengal, eastern up, orissa, chhattisgarh,  
	- reasons:
		- high population density.
		- pollution: mining & industries.
- in [[northeast india]]-
	- no water scarcity till now but may happen in future.
	- there is high rainfall & river water availability.
	- however, deforestation & less percolation of water due to high slopes may lead to water scarcity.
# strategy for water management
- (2.40 pm)
- reduce [[pollution]]:
- community participation in reducing pollution of rivers.
- stringent implementations of laws for stopping water pollution.
- reforestation( plantation in region which had plants ) & afforestation(plantation on land which had no plant cover).
- recycle & reuse in urban areas.
- sustainable [[agriculture]].
- rainwater harvesting:
	- it's a technique of collection & storage of rainwater in natural reservoirs or tanks or infiltration of surface water into sub-surface aquifers.
	- it dilutes contaminants & increases groundwater level.
	- urbanization has increased runoff of rainwater due to high concrete structures.
- some of methods include:
	- rooftop [[rainwater harvesting]] or in-situ collection.
	- surface water collection through check dams etc.
# watershed
- [[watershed]]
- it's area of [[land]] where all of water that is under it or drains of it collects into 1 water body.
- watershed development :
	- it implies rational utilization of land & water resources for optimum & sustained production with minimal hazard to natural resources. _related_ [[optimization]] | [[_economics ÁªèÊµé moc]]
	- it involves conservation & management of surface & groundwater using watersheds as single water. 
	- it's diff from command area development(only development of stream or channel part).
# inter-linking of rivers
(3.26 pm):
[[geo 39 types of forests#^a5c73a]]
- himalayan's drainage system has water excess whereas peninsular region has water deficit.  _related_ [[stock moc]] | [[type ‰∏Ä ÊñáÂåñ]]
- national river linking project:
	- it aims to transfer water from surplus basin to deficit basin through 30 river links connecting a total of 37 rivers.
	- it will connect all major rivers.
	- there are 14 links in northern part & 16 links in southern part.
	- overall it aims to move water artificially.
## benefits:
- irrigation agriculture in drylands.
- high fishing activities.
- high scope of inland navigation.  _related_ [[united states of america]] | [[empire]] | [[=unrivaled]] 
- higher supply of drinking water.
- issues with interlinking of rivers:
	- difficult to define surplus
- environmental concerns:
	- destruction of wildlife corridors & habitats
	- damage to wildlife & forest region including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries
	- it will disturb entire ecosystem of respective rivers.
- economic issue: too expensive project.
	- high displacement of people.
	- there will be high disputes regarding water sharing b/w states.
- way forward:
	- need to implement on case to case [[ad hoc]] basis rather than project as a whole.
	- adequate research & analysis regarding projects.
# natural vegetation
(3.45 pm) #low_confidence 
- distribution of natural [[vegetation]] in world:
- vegetation mainly depends on 2 factors:
- [[temperature]] & [[precipitation]].
- there are 5 major categories of vegetation: #pneumonic _edmm?_

- _evergreen rain forest_:
- it has a very high diversity & multilayered vegetation.
- mainly found in equatorial regions: regions with high rainfall (more than 200 cm) & high temperature.
- limitation factor is sunlight due to layering of vegetation.
- major regions: amazon basin, congo basin, ecuador, venezuela, part of western africa, & southeast asia.

_deciduous forests_:
- trees shed leaves during dry seasons.
- they have a huge variation with many sub-categories of forests.
- majorly found in monsoon type of climate like india, south asia, eastern africa, indo-china, etc.

_mediterranean type forest_:
- in meditation type climate region.
- short buses with deep root system but evergreen.
- grapes, olive, & citrus fruits lead to development of industries in these regions.

_mixed forest_:
- it's a mix of coniferous & deciduous(broadleaves) types of forest.
- not too cold or hot & uniform precipitation throughout year.
- regions: british type, northeast usa, parts of china.
- taiga forest/ coniferous forest/boreal frost :
- tree in a conical shape to shed off snow.
- they are present in siberia types of climate.
- they have very little biodiversity.
- they are very vast & are spread over large areas of land.
- 1/3rd of all forests on land are coniferous forests only. 
- they are found in northern hemisphere only.
- it's also evergreen in nature.
- region: eurasia, canada, alaska.
