Sufism (Arabic: ٱلصُّوفِيَّة), also known as Tasawwuf (ٱلتَّصَوُّف), is a mystic body of religious practice within Islam characterized by a focus on Islamic spirituality, ritualism, asceticism and esotericism.It has been variously defined as "Islamic mysticism", "the mystical expression of Islamic faith", "the inward dimension of Islam", "the phenomenon of mysticism within Islam", the "main manifestation and the most important and central crystallization" of mystical practice in Islam, and "the interiorization and intensification of Islamic faith and practice".Practitioners of Sufism are referred to as "Sufis" (from صُوفِيّ, ṣūfīy), and historically typically belonged to "orders" known as tariqa (pl. ṭuruq) – congregations formed around a grand master wali who would be the last in a chain of successive teachers linking back to Muhammad.Sufism emerged early on in Islamic history, partly as a reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad Caliphate (661–750). Although Sufis were opposed to dry legalism, they strictly observed Islamic law and belonged to various schools of Islamic jurisprudence and theology. Although the overwhelming majority of Sufis, both pre-modern and modern, remain adherents of Sunni Islam, certain strands of Sufi practice developed within the ambit of Shia Islam during the late medieval period, particularly after the Safavid conversion of Iran. Important focuses of Sufi worship include dhikr, the practice of remembrance of God. Sufis also played an important role in Islamic history through their missionary and educational activities.Despite a relative decline of Sufi orders in the modern era, Sufism has continued to play an important role in the Islamic world, and has also influenced various forms of spirituality in the West.
