It is defined as a land-use system that integrates trees and shrubs on farmlands and rural landscapes to enhance [[productivity]], profitability, diversity, and [[ecosystem]] sustainability.
It is a dynamic, ecologically-based natural resource management system that through the integration of woody perennials on farms and in the agricultural landscape diversifies and sustains production and builds social institutions.
## It combines forestry with
[[Production]] of multiple outputs with the protection of the resource base.
Places emphasise the use of multiple indigenous trees and shrubs.
Particularly suitable for low-input conditions and fragile [[environment]]s.
It involves the interplay of socio-cultural values more than in most other land-use systems.
It is structurally and functionally more complex than monoculture.

Agroforestry systems include both traditional and modem land-use systems where trees are managed together with crops and orl animal production systems in agricultural settings.
Agroforestry is practised in both irrigated and rain-fed conditions where it produces food, fuel, fodder, timber, fertilizer, and fibre, contributes to food, nutritional and ecological security, sustains livelihoods, alleviates poverty, and promotes productive and resilient cropping and farming environments.
Agroforestry also has the potential to enhance ecosystem services through carbon storage, prevention of deforestation, biodiversity conservation, and soil and water conservation.
In addition, when strategically applied on a large scale, with the appropriate mix of species, agroforestry enables agricultural land to withstand extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, and climate change.
