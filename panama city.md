on 28 january 1671, the original city was destroyed by a fire when the privateer henry morgan sacked and set fire to it. the city was formally reestablished two years later on 21 january 1673, on a peninsula located 8 km (5 miles) from the original settlement. the site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins, and is now a popular tourist attraction, and is regularly visited by school trips.
