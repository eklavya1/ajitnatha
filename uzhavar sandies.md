It is the farmer's market in Tamil Nadu. It is a type of alternate marketing channel where farmers directly sell their products to consumers. It helps in increasing the incomes
of the farmers.
In the field of agriculture, marketing determines the value of the agricultural product in terms of money and delivers them to the final customer.
Most of the farmers sell their produce through village-level markets, fairs, Mandies, Co-operative Societies, etc. In the above process of agricultural marketing, the middlemen exploit farmers as well as consumers.
To eliminate the middlemen between farmers and consumers, the Government of Tamil Nadu introduced the new concept, namely "UZHAVAR SANTHAI" in 1999.
Generally, the middlemen and wholesale businessmen purchase the Agricultural products from the farmers at a lower price.
They also get the commission from the farmers for the transactions made.
In turn, fresh vegetables and fruits purchased at the lower price from the farmers are sold out to retail businessmen at a higher price and the retail businessmen sell those Agricultural Products further at a higher price to the consumers.
As a result, the farmers get only the lower price for their produce whereas the consumers have to pay a higher price for the same product.
Hence, the Government of Tamil Nadu has introduced an altemate scheme of marketing, which is known as "UZHAVAR SANTHAI" to derive more benefits to the farmers as
well as consumers.
