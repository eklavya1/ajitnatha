# EMERGENCE 的 MODERN 印度 NATIONALISM (PRE-1885)
• 里 [[1885]] - [[indian national congress]] estd
• Phases
	○ Pre-1885
	○ INC 1885-1907 moderates dominated
	○ 1907+ extremists dominated
	○ 1920 era 的 mass nationalism under [[gandhi]] ^1fa533

_• Pre-[[1885]]_
		§ Educated middle class took up leadership, used to believe 里 benevolence 的 brit rule 和 highlighted that 印度 人 were 不 benefitting من brit rule
			§ Methods employed
				□ Petitions
				□ Requests
		§ [[indian national congress]] 1885-[[1907]] moderates dominated
			§ Goals
				□ Let 印度 人 participate 里 政府 
				□ [[Swaraj]] 或 self 政府 (但 full [[independence]])

- _§ [[1907]]+ extremists dominated_
	- § believed 里 extra- constitutional struggle _related_ [[kashmir]] | [[afghanistan]] [[lebanon]]
	- § Demanded self-政府
- § [[1920]] era 的 mass nationalism under gandhi
	- § Extra-constitutional 但 non-violent struggle
	- § 1900s - revolutionary terrorism
	- §  要 repeat 的 [[1857]]
	- § 个人 heroic actions
	- § [[1929]]- demand 的 full independence
- • 印度 nationalism was a product 的 colonialism, the first challenge was to unite ourselves 和 second was then to get self rule 所以 印度 was a 国 里 the making as quoted by [[surendranath bannerjea tk]]
- • Nationalism got shaped by colonial policies 因为 nationalism meant removal 的 grievances instilled 被 colonial rule. It 也 mean a desire to create west like modern nation 国 (peace 的 westphalia) ;pride 里 古 文化 i.e. cultural nationalism. The early nationalists conceptalized 印度 as a 国 的 one 人.
- • First challenge was to unite ourselves 和 then to get self-rule. However the 人 were untouched 被 [[western 教学]] and 所以  continued to be divided on caste, religion, linguistic 和 文化 lines. Thus the 人 remained outside the scope 的 early nationalism 哪 majorly impacted the educated middle class. Sadly, later politicization of 人 happened on issue 的 caste, religion
- • Mass nationalism 开始 properly under gandhi
- • 印度 was a plural society 所以 有 many voices 里 印度 nationalism. i.e. multiple interests 的 diff sections were voiced 里 the INM (印度 national movement). The project 的 INM leaders was to integrate these diff voices i.e. INM propelled the project 的 国 里 the making to build a common nationality. Its claimed that to achieve unity INM leaders at times did 不 directly resolve the differences 中 sections 哪 contributed to continued social tensions post-[[independence]] 和 只 partition. However 国 building 是 continuous process 的 contestation 和 accommodation 的  diff voices.

- § State- 是 organizational n网络  that governs a 国 和 the country
§ Country- territory
§ Nation- 人
§ Nation-state= org created 被 人 为 self governance

• Post-1857 INM ()
	• Sub-topic of early nationalism
	• Peasant protests contd 但 some 新 features were observed-
		§ Greater awareness 的 colonial [[policies]] 和 institutions 中 人
			§ 比如 - 现在 peasants 和 tribals 用 brit courts 和 the legal system to get redressal against oppression
		§ Post-1857 middle class intelligentsia took up leadership 的 peasant movements 和 所以 brought the peasant question into the INM
