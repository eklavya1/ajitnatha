reducing emissions from deforestation & forest degradation (REDD) is a set of steps designed to use market/financial incentives in order to  reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from deforestation & forest degradation. 
it was first negotiated under united nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) in [[2005]], with objective of mitigating climate 
change through reducing net emissions of greenhouse gases through enhanced forest management in developing countries.
most of key redd+ decisions were completed by [[2013]], with final pieces of rulebook finished in [[2015]].
its original objective is to reduce greenhouse gases but it's claimed that it can deliver "co-benefits" such as biodiversity conservation & poverty alleviation.
"reducing emissions from [[deforestation]] & forest degradation" implies a distinction b/w 2 activities.
deforestation is permanent removal of forests & withdrawal of land from forest use.
forest degradation refers to negative changes in forest area that limit its [[production]] capacity.
redd is sometimes presented as "offset" scheme of [[carbon]] markets & thus, would produce carbon credits.
main actors: REDD UNFCCC are undertaken by national or local govt, dominant NGOS, private sector, or any combination of these.
it's being pushed strongly by world bank & UN for setting up bases for carbon market & legal & governance frameworks of countries receiving  REDD.
