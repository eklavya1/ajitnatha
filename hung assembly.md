- In a parliamentary system, to form a government political parties have to get a clear majority in any state election, but in cases when no single political party or pre-poll alliance gets a majority it is called a hung assembly. In such situations, a coalition government may be formed in which parties might enter into alliances after the elections. The government may be formed with outside support of parties and independent MLAs. In case no government is formed then Presidentâ€™s Rule could be imposed by the state governor under Article 356 of the Constitution. Re-election could also take place.
