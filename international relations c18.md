## regional organizations

### celac
celac- community of latin american & caribbean states
it's a pan-regional organization.
it comprises 33 latin american & caribbean states.
it was formed in 2010.
aim is welfare- social, economic, & political welfare.
similar to eu, saarc, au
### mercosur
#pre members are *bapu*. (uruguay,paraguay,brazil,argentina)
#imp 
formed in [[1991]]
various levels of economic integration
preferential trade agreement- there is a positive list of goods.
fta- there is a negative list where trading will not take place at liberalized tariffs.
so, fta is broader.
### andean community
community comprising of andes community.
customs union. [[trade]] is done at liberalized tariffs.
no tariffs in b/w countries. however, they have a common tariff for rest of world. eg- eeu
pacific alliance
formed by countries which have borders with pacific ocean- chile, colombia, & peru.

## importance of lac
(1.49 pm)

economic reasons- for trade & investment- there are countries like mexico, etc which are emerging in nature.
india has pta with mercosur.
india has fta with peru. india is observer in pacific alliance. india’s trade with pacific alliance accounts for 40% with lac.
india is a major pharmaceutical exporter to region.
energy security- region is rich in oil & natural gas.
la accounts for 15% of india’s crude oil imports mainly from mexico & venezuela.
this allows india to diversify energy supplies & reduce our oil dependence.
west asia- politically volatile region
opec countries- mexico & columbia are not members of opec. they charge asian premium (more prices are charged from india & other asian countries).
opec operates as a cartel & charges asian premium.
to help fight climate change- several lac countries are members of international solar alliance (a joint india french initiative)
bolivia, chile, & argentina have highest lithium reserves in world & are c/a lithium triangle.
india plans to roll out 1/3rd of its cars like electric cars by 2030.
this will require lithium supplies as it's essential component in batteries of electric cars of which india does not have sufficient reserves.
food security- latin america has vast tracts of fertile land with rich water resources.
lac represents land 5 times size of india & has only 1/2 of india’s population.
geopolitical importance- region is important in order to aid india in its global ambitions such as permanent membership of unsc & on various platforms of global negotiations vis-à-vis trade, climate change, terrorism, etc.

## evolution of india’s relations with lac
(2.12 pm)

dictation (2.22 pm)

for a long, latin america has been referred to as “*forgotten continent*” in india’s foreign policy.
despite, shared experiences of colonialism, neo-imperialism, & being developing economies, relations have lacked necessary depth (shared common goals, vis-à-vis global trade, global political representations)
during cold war era
both india & la were not each other priorities.
reasons
in diff political camps during cold war era.
indian economy was inward-looking while la was suffering from political instability & severe economic challenges.
india was able to meet its energy requirement from gulf countries.
though both engaged on platforms of unga, g-77, nam, this did not create conditions for deeper engagement b/w two.
only significant development was visit of then indian pm indira gandhi to region.
she described it as a “voyage of discovery.”

## post-cold war
latin america was still not india’s foreign policy priority.
india was occupied in its immediate & extended neighbourhood while trying to improve its relations with [[united states of america]].
however, during this time, [[china]] started registering a strong footprint in region.
credit for push to [[india]] lac relations, in fact, goes to india’s private sector that identified opportunities in it, pharmaceuticals, farming, & [[mineral]] exploration & opened its commercial enterprises in region.
thus, unlike usual phenomena, india-lac relations are a case of *“flag foll trade.”*
### in recent years
not only there is necessary imp given to l. amer in india’s strategic thinking, lac is acc to due imp to india.
in [[2011]], inter america development bank published a #report titled “india: latin america’s next big thing.”
celac held its 1st outreach summit in [[2012]] in new [[delhi]]
in [[2016]], un economic commission for lac suggested immense economic potential in india's lac relations.
despite identification of potential & opportunities, la continues to be relegated (pushed) to backwaters of india’s diplomacy.

## china in lac
(2.40 pm)
china’s energy security, food security, raw materials, challenge us hegemony in region.

evidence of china’s presence
china’s trade with region stands at 264 billion dollars compared to india’s 36 billion dollars.
china has replaced eu as 2nd largest trade partner of region in [[2017]].
with target of $ 500 billion in trade & $250 billion in investment in region by [[2025]].
china seeks to establish itself as dominant economic power in region.
massive infrastructure projects have been announced by china such as bi-oceanic railways that will connect port of santos in [[brazil]] to callao in [[peru]].
canal project in [[nicaragua]].
中国 china has released a policy paper on latin america & caribbean in 2016. it identifies target areas of cooperation such as trade, agriculture, etc.
changes & continuity in india’s foreign policy- homework

## india vs. chinese approach in lac
(3.07 pm)
dictation- 3.12 pm
unlike china’s extractive policies which generate few local employments, indian companies have provided [[employment]], training, skill [[development]], etc
many viewed china as pushing lac into corner of raw material apart from turning into a dumping ground for cheap consumer goods.
**like in [[africa]], there is resentment against china.**
china focuses on elite-level relation-building whereas india pursues people-to-people relations.

## various challenges
(3.20 pm)

lack of economic engagement to india’s & region’s potential
officially govt of india (goi) has identified distance & language to be primary barriers or challenges.
relations suffer from out of sight, out of mind syndrome.
weakens in political engagements- lack of necessary high-level political visits b/w india & lac countries.
goi unlike in case of africa has not come out with a policy paper on region. consequently, it fails to identify & prioritize sectors of engagement with region.
weak diplomatic presence- up till [[2019]], india’s diplomatic presence was limited to 15 lac countries only unlike china which has embassies in all 33 countries of region.
indian media has also failed to effectively report initiatives taken by both sides for stronger relations.
for instance - 5 visits by national representatives of lac countries b/w [[2015]]-2019 were largely underreported.
lack of sufficient media coverage checks public interest in relations in turn affecting political initiatives at govt level with respect to region.
rivalries b/w countries of region (lac)- argentina & brazil for regional dominance affect india’s relations with regions.
political volatility in countries like venezuela has prevented india to develop a coherent foreign policy vis-à-vis lac.

## solutions
(3.38 pm)
focus on connectivity – india needs to incentivize shipping companies to reduce cost of transport of goods. even today, there are no direct flights b/w indian & latin american cities.
people to people ties- india needs to promote latin american studies
india needs to improve its diplomatic presence in lac.
in [[2010]], govt of india has proposed to open 3 new embassies in lac countries but no step has been taken in that regard.
we need to institutionalize india’s relations at pan latin america level as india has done in case of india africa & india central asia relations.
india has potential to emerge as a major asian partner of latin america if it engages on a consistent rather than ad-hoc basis
use culture as a tool to foster cultural relations given their affinity for each other’s culture. eg- yoga & indian cuisines for latin america & zumba salsa of theirs for india- could help foster people-to-people ties.

## conclusion
conclusion
apart from distance & language, it's psychological barrier that prevents india & lac from engaging with 1 another.
india needs to break away from this barrier to ensure vibrant india- latin america relations.

## india africa relations
(3.50 pm)

geographical regions- maghreb region, sahel, horn of africa, red sea.
maghreb region- northwest africa
algeria, morocco, tunisia, libya
sahel region-nigeria, chad, etc.
horn of africa- djibouti, somalia, sudan, eritrea, & ethiopia
### importance of africa (4.05 pm)
geopolitical importance- required for unsc reforms.
geo-economic- there are emerging economies. it has transformed itself from a continent of dark to a continent of hope.
it was not performing well earlier in economic terms.
dictation- economic growth of continent was estimated at 3.2% in 2018.
it's home to 6 of world’s fastest-growing economies- ethiopia, djibouti, senegal, tanzania, etc.
african continental free trade agreement (afcfta) has entered into force. it will raise intra africa trade by 52% & has created 1 of largest economic spaces in world.
geopolitical- youthful economy.
by 2030, africa will represent a quarter of world’s workforce & consumers.
geostrategic- conventional security threats- to counter china & india. china has acquired 1st overseas base in djibouti
non-conventional- piracy off coast of somalia, human/ drug trafficking, terrorism, etc.
it's also important for india’s energy security & food security. india imports 16% of its crude oil requirement from africa.
fallow lands in africa are cultivated by india’s private sector. indians are cultivating oilseeds & pulses in africa & importing same.
