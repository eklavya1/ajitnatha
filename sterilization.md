it's intervention by rbi in money market to keep money supply stable against exogenous or sometimes external shocks such as increase in foreign exchange inflow.
it's a form of monetary action in which a central bank seeks to limit effect of inflows & outflows of capital on money supply.
commercial bank's total reserves & deposits remain unchanged (it has purchased foreign currency from seller using its vault cash, which, therefore, goes down; but bank's deposit with rbi goes up by equivalent amount â€” leaving its total reserves unchanged).
there will, however, be increments in assets & liabilities on rbi balance sheet.
rbi's foreign exchange holding goes up.
on other hand, deposits of commercial banks with rbi also increase by equal amount.
but that means increase in stock of high-powered money which, by definition, is equal to total liability of rbi. with a money multiplier in operation, this, in turn, will result in increased money supply in economy.
