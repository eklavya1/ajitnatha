- archibald percival wavell, 1st earl wavell was a senior officer of the british army, serving in many conflicts of the british empire before serving as the viceroy of [[india]] during the most crucial period of the independence struggle.

- on 15 june [[1943]], [[prime minister]] [[winston churchill]] offered lord wavell the position of viceroy of india, which he accepted. upon his arrival in india, one of his first actions was to address the disastrous [[bengal famine]] which had killed millions of indians.
- he did this by ordering the army to distribute relief supply to the rural populations & attempting to increase the supply of rising by reducing its price. the latter action yielded mixed results.
- he attempted with mixed success to increase the supplies of rice to reduce the prices. during his reign, [[gandhi]] was leading the quit india campaign, [[mohammad ali jinnah]] was working for an independent state for the muslims & [[sc bose]] befriended japan, who was steadily making a push towards the eastern borders of [[india]].
- sympathetic to the indian independence struggle, lord wavell convened the [[shimla conference]] & the wavell plan to bring the various factions together in order to set the tone for the future government of independent india. both failed as the [[indian national congress]] & the [[muslim league]] could not come to an agreement.
- in any case, he received far less support from his government. winston churchill did not support him as he was against the idea of indian independence & the next prime minister [[clement atlee]], felt lord wavell was making any headway in presenting a solution that was palatable to both the congress & the league. eventually, atlee lost confidence in him & had lord wavell replaced with lord mountbatten in [[1947]]
