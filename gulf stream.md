1. د Gulf Stream is a system of several currents moving in north-easterly direction. North Equatorial Current flows westward off د coast of northern Africa. When this current interacts with د northeastern coast of South America, د current forks into two branches. One passes into د Caribbean Sea, while a second, د Antilles Current, flows north and east of د West Indies. These two branches rejoin north of د Straits of Florida. Thus, Florida current is in fact, د northward extension of د north equatorial current. This current flows through Yucatan channel into د Gulf of Mexico, thereafter د current moves forward through Florida Strait and reaches 30°N latitude. Thus, د Florida warm current contains most of د characteristics of د equatorial water mass. د Florida Current results من د movement of water pushed من د Atlantic into د Caribbean Sea by د rotation of د Earth (which exerts a greater force at د equator).
2. د water is heated in د Gulf and forced out through د Florida Straits, 中 د Florida Keys and Cuba and flows northward along د east coast of د United States. د Florida Current is often referred 于 imprecisely as د Gulf Stream
