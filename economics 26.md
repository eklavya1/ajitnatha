a brief overview of previous class (9:13 am)

## speculative demand (9:18 am)
- speculative demand of money refers to amount of money demanded for speculative purposes.
- speculation means taking decisions today based on expectations from tomorrow.
- different people have different views about how are various factors that affect their wealth going to behave in future.
- therefore, they take certain decisions today to protect themselves from any adversaries in future.
- amount of money demanded based on expectations of future is called speculative demand.
- illustration
- let m be total money available with a person
- let t be his transaction demand. therefore’ m-t’ is left with person.
- if he keeps this m-t in form of liquid cash then this money, l can be used in case of emergencies or for any other purpose beyond normal transaction demand.
- however, this liquid money will also deteriorate due to [[inflation]].
- therefore, a person would have to decide whether to keep excess money (m-t) in form of liquid cash or convert it into some assets where there is a reasonable expectation that this asset will not just protect value invested but will also appreciate & generate some return in future.
- different people have different views about assets. for some, same asset may be costly & for others, it may have potential to appreciate in future.
- based on their expectations people will use excess money to either buy assets or sell them (if they possess them), or just hold on to excess cash.
- their decisions to buy or sell assets or simply hold cash are based on their expectations from future.
- amount of money that people hold at any time in form of liquid cash is called speculative demand for money.
- this speculative demand would be high when people hold more cash. reflecting that they view current asset prices to be costly & expect them to fall in future.
- when more people expect asset prices to fall in future, they will either sell their existing assets & convert them into cash, or those who do not have assets will simply keep on holding cash because they expect asset prices to fall in future.
- therefore, liquid cash would be preferred manner of keeping excess money (m-t) speculative demand would be high.
- on other hand, if most people believe that asset prices will rise in future, they would to tempted to buy assets & hence, therefore, will convert their excess money (m-t) into assets because they expect appreciation.
- hence speculative demand which refers to amount of money more than transaction demand, not converted into assets, would be below.
## speculative demand with government bond (10:20 pm)
-[[government]] bond is an asset that promises a certain return(r)
- if interest rate that a person gets from a savings bank account(r) is less than capital r, then a government bond would be a more attractive instrument to put money in.
- since it’s more attractive people will be willing to pay a premium based on its relative attractiveness.
- market price of bond that is asset would reflect this relative attractiveness.
- if in future relative attractiveness decreases because of ‘r’ that is interest on saving bank account increases, premium commanded by same asset will decrease.
- whereas if in future relative attractiveness increases, premium commanded will increase.
- premium commanded depends upon interest rate being offered on savings bank account.
- in general, all interest rates in economy are linked to interest rate set by central bank. therefore, they move together.
- thus, if interest increases, asset becomes relatively less attractive & therefore lose their value.
- holders of asset will experience a capital loss.
- on other hand, if interest rate decrease, then assets will become relatively more attractive hence their value will increase.
- holders of asset thus experience capital gain.
- therefore, it can be seen that asset prices move in opposite direction of interest rates.
- when interest rate increase assets become cheaper & when they decrease assets becomes costly.
- decision to buy, sell or hold an asset is thus based on expectations regarding movement of interest rate.
- if people expect interest rate to fall in future because they view present interest to be high, they will anticipate rise in value of a capital asset.
- thus, their decision to hold on to their assets & convert all their liquid money into assets.
- thus, their speculative demand will be on lower side.
- on other hand, if same interest rates are viewed by people to be low at present, they expect them to rise in future hence anticipating capital losses.
- therefore, they will decide to sell their capital assets & convert them into liquid cash. thus, their speculative demand is high.

the topic of next class—the money function will be continued….
