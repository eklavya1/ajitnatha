- [[darpa]] was created by congress in [[1958]]
- rivalry fosters excellence and is imperative for supremacy
- kriegspiel, a chess variant once favored by the powerful german military

- tia was a many-tentacled program. the problem of language barriers had also long been a thorn in the military’s side. darpa needed to develop computer-based translation programs in what it called “the war languages,” arabic, pashto, urdu, dari, and other middle eastern and south asian dialects.
- pdf 266 para 1 - the logo of the information awareness office became the focus of much ire. it featured the eye of providence icon—the same as the one on the back of the dollar bill—casting a searchlight over a globe. darpa’s latin motto, *scientia est potentia*, or “knowledge is power,” fueled its own comparisons to george orwell’s nineteen eighty-four.
- p 270 para 2 ; he espoused the idea that a war that relied on advanced technology was a morally superior war.
- p 280, last line - “understanding and empathy will be important weapons of war.” then he made a bold declaration. “world war i was a chemists’ war,” scales said. “world war ii was a physicists’ war,” and the war on terror was “the social scientists’ war.”
- computers never entirely lose the information they record. because of this, and since the los alamos national laboratory requires a bigger, faster, more efficient computer, roadrunner is being destroyed.
- p 359 , pic caption - one measure of the weapon’s success is that it is still in use across the world,” says darpa.
- rivalry spawns supremacy
- p 338, last para - this notion that science fiction can profoundly impact reality remains especially interesting to me because in researching and reporting this book, i learned that during the war on terror, the pentagon began seeking ideas from science-fiction writers, most notably a civilian organization called the sigma group. its founder, dr. arlan andrews, says that the core idea behind forming the group was to save the world from terrorism, and to this end the sigma group started offering “futurism consulting” to the pentagon and the white house. the group’s motto is “science fiction in the national interest.”
