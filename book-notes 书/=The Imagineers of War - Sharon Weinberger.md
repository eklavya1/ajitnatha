- p 18, 1st para - DARPA’s history of innovation is more closely tied to this turbulent period in the 1960s and early 1970s, when it delved into questions of nuclear warfare and counterinsurgency, than to its brief life as a “space agency.” Those two crucial decades represent a time when senior Pentagon officials believed the agency should play a critical role in shaping world events, rather than just develop technological novelties.

- p55, ii para - The plan, as York would later describe it, was to create “an Astrodome-like defensive shield made up of highenergy electrons trapped in the earth’s magnetic field just above the atmosphere.” This shield would protect the planet against intercontinental ballistic missiles by essentially frying whatever attempted to pass through the band of killer electrons. “His purpose was of epic proportions,” York recalled. “He intended nothing less than to place an impenetrable shield of high-energy electrons over our heads, a shield that would destroy any nuclear warhead that might be sent against us.”
