## args 反 ews reservation
- challenges in identification of beneficiaries: in a country where taxable [[population]] is still very low due to misrepresentation of income, implementing economic eligibility criteria would be a bureaucratic nightmare.<br>  
- • ‘pandora’s box’ of demands: there may be demand from sections of scs/sts & obcs<br>  
to introduce similar sub-categorization, based on economic criteria, within their respective<br>  
quotas. it might also fuel demands for new caste-based censuses to expand quota limits<br>  
based on sc/st or obc proportions in [[population]], or to extend reservations to<br>  
private sector jobs. quota in promotions [[may]] also gain widespread acceptability, both<br>  
among public & judiciary.<br>  
- • shrinking public sector: with steadily shrinking jobs pool in central govt,<br>  
central public sector enterprises (cpses) & even banks, 10% [[polity 09|reservation]] will not fulfill<br>  
expectations.<br>  
- • anti-merit: in common perception, reservation has also become synonymous with antimerit. with extension of reservation, this opinion might get further ingrained in public psyche.
- • tool of populism: offering reservations has increasingly become tool for political<br>  
gains in [[politics]]. this affects their credibility as a tool for social justice.<br>  
- • passage of bill: bill was not circulated ahead of being introduced, it was not<br>  
examined by a parliamentary committee & there was hardly any time b/w its<br>  
introduction & final discussion.<br>  
- • also, [[sinho commission]] [[report]] of 2010, which centre has been citing as basis for its legislation to grant 10 % [[polity 09|reservation]] to 
- ews, never explicitly recommended a<br>  
reservation for ews but was only emphatic about ensuring that ews get access to all<br>  
welfare schemes
