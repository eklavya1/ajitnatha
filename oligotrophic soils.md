	- The oligotrophic soils contain low amounts of nutrients. These soils generally develop in old and geologically stable areas, such as soils found in much of the tropical rain forest region. Due to intense weathering and high rates of [[leaching]], these soils have a poor nutrient retention capacity. In nutrient poor soils, nutrient accumulation in vegetation is high.
	- Plant adaptations to oligotrophic soils provide for greater and more efficient nutrient uptake, reduced nutrient consumption, and efficient nutrient storage. Improvements in nutrient uptake are facilitated by root adaptations such as nitrogen-fixing root nodules, mycorrhizae and cluster roots.
	- **Cluster Roots:** Cluster roots, are plant roots that form clusters of closely spaced short lateral rootlets. They [[may]] form a two- to five-centimetre-thick mat just beneath the leaf litter to enhance nutrient uptake.
	- A **Mycorrhiza** is a symbiotic association composed of a fungus and roots of a vascular plant. It helps in efficient absorption of nutrients e.g. phosphorus.
	- **Nitrogen-fixing root nodules:** Root nodules occur on the roots of plants that associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
