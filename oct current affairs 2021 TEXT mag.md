POLITY AND GOVERNANCE1.1. CBI VS STATESWhy in News?Central Government told the Supreme Court that West Bengal government does not have any  “absolute” power to keep the Central Bureau of  Investigation (CBI) frominvestigatingcrimes inside  the State.More about News• Union Government was responding to a suitfiled by the West Bengal Government against the Union of India under Article 131 of the Constitution. o Article 131 deals with original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, where the apex court deals with any dispute between the Centre and a state; the Centre and a state on the one side and another state on the other side; and two or more states.• The State has challenged the CBI’s jurisdiction to register FIRs and conduct investigations in the State in numerous cases. o West Bengal said it had withdrawn “general consent” to the CBI in 2018 and CBI’s actions were a direct attack on the federal structure of governance.• Eight states have currently withdrawn consent to the CBI like Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, etc. • This recent clash arises the question on Cooperative Federalism in India and there is need to ensure smooth functioning of federal system in India.• Apart from CBI issue there are many other clashes between Centre & State like implementation of Centre-run schemes, implementation of GST and the actions taken by central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureauetc.What are the aspects of federalism are affected with respect to CBI vs States tussle?• Police: Under 7th Schedule, List II made 'Police' a state subject conferring exclusive domain to the state to make laws regarding the same. However, the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act 1946 which establishes the CBI continues to function as a central agency carrying out its functions as 'Police'.o Sections 5 and 6 of the DSPE Act deal with the extension of powers and jurisdiction of special police establishment to other areas and the requirement of consent of the state governments.• General consent for the CBIo Under DPSE Act, CBI must mandatorily obtain the consent of the state government concerned before beginning to investigate a crime in a state.o The consent of the state government can be either case-specific or general.o A “general consent” is normally given by states to help the CBI in seamless investigation of cases of corruptionagainst central government employees in their states. o In the absence of which the CBI would have to apply to the state government in every case, and before taking even small actions.4 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Extra territorial operation: The concept of CBI is more advanced involving specialized information, technical knowledge whilst incorporating extra territorial operation. Why such issues emerge in a case of Cooperative Federalism in India?Cooperative federalism is the horizontal relationship between union and states and shows neither is above the other. However, various issues have been emerging in ensuring Cooperative Federalism due to following reasons:• Concurrent jurisdictions: Bodies like CBI, Narcotics Control Bureau etc requires in multijurisdictional crimes, yet its concurrence with the local police force and pre-emptions cause re-current federal issues. • Power tilted to Centre: At the same time, it would become injurious to the interests of the country to provide for a weak central authority which would be incapable of ensuring peace, of coordinating vital matters of common.• Complexity of Article 131: Over the years, the Supreme Court has taken heterogeneous decisions on whether a state can challenge the Centre under Article 131. o Ex: under Article 131 by the Chhattisgarh government against the Centre challenging the National Investigation Act, 2008 passed by the Centre in spite of police being a state subject.• No body to foster coordination, manage bargaining & conflict resolution: Sarkaria Commission suggested setting up of an Inter-State Council Secretariat. But as it was set up within the Union home ministry, it ceased to be an independent body to foster coordination, manage intergovernmental bargaining and conflict resolution.o Presently there is no independent institution to resolve Centre-state and inter-state issues.• Centralization of power creating friction: Trust deficit between Centre and States is widening. Centre’s divisible pool of taxes has shrunk due to a rise in the share of surcharge and cesses, which can be used only for purposes specified and are not devolved to States.• Different political parties: When different political parties form governments at the Centre and State, often their interests don’t align. Hence, it becomes vital to adequately utilise the constitutional and statutory institutions set up to resolve such conflicts and further the welfare of the people, which is the ultimate goal of governance.Way forward• Transparency and coordination among Centre and states: There is need to be transparent about the current macro-economic scenario through an honest appraisal that revisits revenue projections and offers a set of strategic pathways for consultation with states through a special session between the Union Ministers and state ministers.• Suggestions from Centre states relations committee: Sarkaria Commission and PunchhiCommissiononcentrestaterelationsgaveseveralrecommendationstocultivatecooperativefederalism and suggested actionable steps. Certain constitutional amendments can better federalism and its actualisation. To list a few:o the office of the Governor should be apolitical, and the terms of his removal should be altered;o extending the mandate of the Inter-State Council beyond advice and recommendations;o laying down guidelines to prevent misuse of the President's veto of the legislation;o it's only fair to include states when the Centre enters into any international agreements.• Giving Fiscal space: Gradual widening of the fiscal capacity of the states has to be legally guaranteed without reducing the Centre’s share. • Electoral reforms: Adequate electoral reforms for creating a level playing field for the regional political parties and regional leaders would facilitate more competitive political contest between the national and regional political forces.• Specific recommendations for bodies like CBI:o Following the European principle of subsidiarity, framing definite grounds on which state governments can restrict general consent or transfer cases to CBI for a higher-level investigation can aid in reducing the friction between the central and state governments.o Giving statutory recognition to CBI will provide it with constitutional recognition independent of its existence from DSPE Act. o A comprehensive system involving the co-operation of legislature, executive and judiciary can revamp and revive the lost glory of CBI.5 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 1.2. PUBLIC PROCUREMENT AND PROJECT MANAGEMENTWhy in News?Recently, the Department of Expenditure under the Ministry of Finance released guidelines for reforms in Public Procurement and Project Management.Public Procurement and Project Management Framework in India• Public Procurement and Project Management includes the procurement of goods and services by public entities and execution of different projects. E.g., the goods or services purchased by government entities for public service delivery.• Presently, the General Financial Rules (2017) and the Ministry of Finance Procurement Manuals act as general guidelines to be followed by all agencies with freedom for agencies to have its own procurement rules complying with general rules.○ E.g., the Ministry of Defence, Railways etc. with almost 50% of their respective budget spent on public procurement have their own procurement guidelines such as Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020.Why was a need felt to tweak the framework? • Absence of a comprehensive law: With large sums of taxpayers or country resources spent on them, competitive, transparent, and efficient public procurement and project management is vital for ensuring prudent use of public finance and good governance. But despite such large sums of money and vital role, India lacks a comprehensive law on activities like Public Procurement.• Complex regulatory framework: Three-tiers of governance with diverse ministries and objectives, large number ofstatutory bodies, autonomous institutions, PSUs etc. with different needs. • Growing share of public procurement: Competition Commission of India estimates public procurement in India to be 30% of the GDP (in 2013). • Adherence to Least Cost Selection (or ‘L1’) method: While this method may hold good for procurement of routine works, goods and non-consulting services; but in high impact and technologically complex procurements it leads to sub-optimal delivery, non-performances, higher life cycle cost, delays, and arbitrations.○ E.g., Quality Council of India study of highway development sector highlighted that the L1 method fails to consider quality and performance.In this context, the new guidelines work on aligning all stakeholders’ interests for successful project execution withinspecified time, cost, and quality for faster, efficient and transparent project execution and empowerment of executing agencies for quicker and efficient decision-making in public interest.Key Provisions under latest GuidelinesPrepared after consultation with stakeholders, the new guidelines are released as ‘general instructions’ under the General Financial Rules (GFR), 2017 with main guidelines as:6 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Procedural Clarity via. Clear expression of Technical and Financial eligibility criteria for bidders; Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts to specify broad technical specifications and key output parameters; Defining the role of Project Management Consultant (PMC) clearly in the contracts etc.• Digital Thrust through Open Online Tendering as default; Implementation of Electronic-Measurement books (e MBs)anditsintegrationwithITenabledprojectmonitoringsystemforrecording progress of works etc.• Better Project Execution and Quality via. Detailed Project Reports and Feasibility Study/Ground Survey before undertaking a project; Inclusion of Quality Assurance Plan in tender documents; Permitting alternative contractor selection methods like Quality cum Cost Based Selection (QCBS) as an alternative to traditional L1 system; Stage  wise progress and quality review of large contracts; etc.• Strict payment timelines such as 75% of ad-hoc payments within 10 working days of bill submission; Interest on payment delay etc. to improve liquidity at contractors especially Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).• Dispute Reduction through critical review arbitration/court award and appeal against award only on genuine merit by Public Authorities.• Introduction of incentives by allowing public authorities to devise strategies for giving incentives to stakeholders including bonus, better rating etc.• Allowing Fixed Budget-based Selection (FBS) for consultancy service and Consultant substitution only in compelling or unavoidable circumstances.What are the challenges that remain in Public Procurement and Project Management? • Inefficient use of resources: Timely completion of public projects within the estimated cost and with desired quality is a distant dream due to frequent cost overrun, project delays and wastage of resources.• Presence of Unfair practices and Corruption: Despite more regulations added over time, the transparency and accountability has remained poor. This has led to unfair practices and corruption to limit the competitions at various levels. E.g.○ Institutional requirements on prior vendor registration (limiting suppliers), social obligations on procurement from Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) and Technical guidelines or qualifications;○ Anti-Competitive Practices by Suppliers such as Market Sharing and Cartel Formation, Bid rigging and collusive bidding, abuse of dominance etc.• Poor Decision-Making: Due to complex procedures, the bureaucratic hassles and hazards have increased. It leads to irregularities with lack of decision-making in order to avoid future questioning.• Lack of Competitive Neutrality: No level playing field due to preference to public providers.• Other Constraints: Information Asymmetry among private institutions, especially at MSEs level; Unavailability of sufficient procurement professionals; and Poor Grievance Redressal mechanism. Way ForwardBuilding on existing Rules and procedure, India need reforms in whole public procurement and project management with features, practices, incentives /disincentives etc. as: • Back the General Financial Rules through legislative power for a transparent, accountable, and competitive procurement regime. For example, giving penalty for poor project deliveries legal backing. • Simplify existing procedures to provide flexibility on use of discretion while maintaining enough transparency and active supervision. ○ This can be done by bringing the policy planners, public procurement officials and other stakeholders together to work in tandem.• Identify alternative procurement mechanisms based on emerging trends along with regularly used methods for flexibility and better public service delivery. E.g.○ Promotion of E-procurement methods such as Central Public Procurement Portal and Government e-Marketing (GeM) portal.WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA)• It is a plurilateral agreement (i.e., applying to a number of WTO Members but not all) to ensure open, fair and transparent conditions of competition in the government procurement markets.• It guarantees national treatment and non  discrimination for the suppliers of parties to the Agreement with respect to procurement of covered goods, services, and construction services as set out in each party's schedules• India is not a party to it but an observer governmentfrom 2010.7 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS ○ Incorporating Performance Rating in Competitive Bidding to provide a quality premium to superior bidder rather than simply awarding the contract to L1 bidder,○ Introduction of a Debriefing Procedure to let unsuccessful bidders know why they were not successful as part of ‘Right to Know’.○ Incorporate Integrity Pacts where possible and appoint more Independent External Monitors (first approved by CVC in 2016 for 132 procuring entities).• Close coordination between CCI and Governments/ Departments/ PSUs to detect and deter unfair practices. Revamp and strictly enforce blacklisting rules for corrupt firms.• Periodic awareness and training of procurement officials in all aspects of public procurement for capacity building at various governance levels.1.3. INTERNAL PARTY DEMOCRACYWhy in News?Recent furore over factionalism in the ruling Congress in Punjab and the question regarding the leadership of the party at the national-level in recent months has made it important to understand the larger issues of inner-party democracy in political parties (PP) in the country.About Political Parties and Inner Party Democracy• A political party is an organised group of citizens who hold common views on governance and act as a political unitthat seeks to obtain control of government with a view to further the agenda and policy they profess.• Though, the Constitution of India provides for co  operative societies which is a fundamental right under Article 19 (1)(c), but the Right to form political parties is not.• Internal democracy in political parties refers to the level and methods of including party members in the decision making and deliberation within the party structure.Why Internal Party democracy becomes significant in Indian democratic system?India is one of the most vibrant and robust multi-party democracies in the world which has sustained despite all challenges for over seven decades now. However, it needs Internal Party democracy to succeed and sustain its democracy.• Political parties as a link: They are indispensable links between the people and the representative machinery of government. o They maintain a continuous connection between the people and those who represent them either in government or in the opposition. Any issues within political parties may harm the interests of the people itself.8 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Democratic accountability of a political party: Political parties are the agents of democracy and safety valves in the political system. They have extra-legal growth in almost every democratic country.• Impacts the constitutional right of all citizens: The procedure for determining the leadership and composition of the parties are not completely open and inclusive. o This adversely impacts the constitutional right of all citizens to equal political opportunity to participate in politics and contest elections.• Elitism leading to faulty distribution of tickets: Centralised and ambiguous working of the parties has led to distribution of party ticket to certain sections of the population and excluding the rest of the society. o Party members with adequate social and financial resources are given primacy while distributing tickets for contesting elections.• Reduce ‘criminalisation of politics’: A large number of candidates with criminal background as party nominees has come to the forefront in the recent times. This may get rectified with growth in inner-party democracy. • Lack of transparency and accountability in the inner functioning of the political parties: This has serious consequences for the steady functioning of parliamentary democracy in the country. • No Law regulating appointments: Though RPA disqualifies a sitting legislator or a candidate on certain grounds, there is nothing regulating the appointments to offices within the party. A politician may be disqualified from being a legislator, but (s)he may continue to hold high positions within his/her party.Challenges in setting up in Party Democracy• Inadequate power with Election Commission: Election Commission of India (ECI) is also not equipped to regulate the functioning of the political parties. In the case of ‘Indian National Congress vs Institute of Social Welfare & Others’ of 2002, the Supreme Court held that the ECI cannot take punitive action against registered political parties for violating the principles of inner-party democracyo The court, acknowledging the de-registering powers of the registering authority, maintained that the issue of political parties is different from other forms of registration. o This makes the regulation of the conduct and functioning of the political parties extremely difficult, reducing the chances of democratic working of parties in the country.• Resistance by Dynastic, caste and religion parties: Most of the parties are openly caste- or religious-based and also their finances are dubious and opaque. o Almost all parties are family fiefdoms and there are no periodical in-party elections in Indian parties.• Elitism in parties: Leadership in political party is mostly decided by a coterie of party functionaries who holds sway over the party administration.o Even when elections take place in which the members of the national organisational or decision-making body of the party participate, the pre-determined choice of the party elite is merely supported by the other members.Way Forward• Giving a constitutional status: Political parties in developed nations maintain high levels of internal democracy. Ex: Germany gives constitutional status to political parties. As per its law, their internal organisation must conform to democratic principles.o Such a practice can also be brought to India to make them accountable as well conform to democratic principles.• Responsible body within Political parties: Political parties in developed nations maintain high levels of internal democracy. o Ex: in the U.K., the Conservative Party has a Central Council and an Executive Committee which elects its President, a Chairman and Vice Chairmen at its annual meeting.• Disclose their funding: They must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds.• Rethink anti-defection law: Instead of looking at internal party processes, one way to decentralise power is by getting rid of the anti-defection law. The need to canvass votes in the legislature will create room for negotiation in the party organisation too.9 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Implement suggestions from committees etc:o Several government constituted committees like the Dinesh Goswami Committee, the Tarkunde Committee and Indrajit Gupta Committee, has strongly argued for more transparent working of the political parties in the country. o The 1999 Law Commission Report strongly recommended the introduction of a regulatory framework for governing the internal structures and inner party democracy of the political parties. o A draft Political Parties (Registration and Regulation of Affairs) Act, 2011 was submitted to the Union Law Ministry.✓ Act aims to regulate the constitution, functioning, funding, accounts and audit, and other affairs of and concerning political parties participating in elections.1.4. ANTI-DEFECTION LAWWhy in news?The Calcutta High Court has given West Bengal Assembly Speaker a deadline to pass an order in the defection case.What is defection? Defection may be defined as the practice of floor-crossing by a member of one political outfit to another (also, commonly referred as Horse Trading). For instance, in Lok Sabha, if MPs of Party A join Party B, they are said to have defected and thus will face the prevalent anti-defection proceedings.About Anti-defection Law The Tenth Schedule contains the following provisions with respect to the disqualification of members of Parliament and the state legislatures on the ground of defection.• Disqualification: A member of a House belonging to any political party becomes disqualified for being a member of the House if o He voluntarily gives up his membership of such political party; oro He votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by his political partywithout obtaining prior permission of such party and such act has not been condoned by the party within 15 days.• An independent member of a House becomes disqualified to remain a member of the House if he joins any political party after such election.• A nominated member of a House becomes disqualified for being a member of the House if he joins any political party after the expiry of six months from the date on which he takes his seat in the House.• Exceptions: Legislators may change their party without the risk of disqualification in certain circumstances. o The law allows a party to merge with or into another party provided that at least two-thirds of its legislators are in favour of the merger. o If a person is elected as the speaker of Lok Sabha or the Chairman of Rajya Sabha then he could resign from his party, and rejoin the party once he demits that post.o It must be noted here that the provision of the Tenth Schedule pertaining to exemption from disqualification in case of split by one-third members of legislature party has been deleted by the 91st Amendment Act of 2003.10 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Deciding authority: Any question regarding disqualification arising out of defection is to be decided by the presiding officerof the House.• Rule-making power: The presiding officer of a House is empowered to make rules to give effect to the provisions of the Tenth Schedule.What is the need for an anti-defection law? • Political stability: It provides for greater stability in the body politic by checking the propensity of legislators to change parties. Uncontrolled Horse-Trading and corruption negatively influences the working of the legislature and executive and ultimately affects the progress of the country as a whole.o Considering nascent nature of our democracy and the political defections indiscriminately taking place in India, the anti-defection law is an inevitability to ensure smooth functioning of parliamentary system.• Ensuring loyalty of members: It is an attempt to ensure that members selected in the name of the party and itssupport as well as the party manifesto remain loyal to the political party and its policies.• Upholds the will of people: Floor changing after being elected as representative of people is almost a betrayal committed against the will of the people especially when the electorates hold their trust on the potential of any political parties.• Other advantages: It facilitates democratic realignment of parties in the legislature by way of merger of parties. Further, it helps in reducing corruption at the political level as well as non developmental expenditure incurred on irregular elections.What are the issues with Anti-defection law? Issues in the prevalent idea of Anti-defection• Restricts freedom of speech and expression of legislators: The law puts the members of the party into a bracket of obedience in accordance with the rules and policies of the party, restricting the legislator’s freedom to oppose any acts, policies, leaders, or bills of the party.o In essence, disqualification on grounds of defection, which may actually be a valid dissent, blurs the distinction between the defection and dissent.• Reduces accountability of elected representatives: In India’s parliamentary democracy, the legislature’s check on the executive remains weak due to reasons like absence of effective opposition and the executive being part of the legislature. o By curbing dissent, anti-defection law further undermines the executive’s accountability to the legislature. • Undermines representative government: In a bid to not attract the provisions of the Tenth Schedule, legislators can feel compelled to toe party lines even if that does not represent the will of their constituents. It restricts a legislator from voting in line with his conscience, judgement and interests of his electorate.Issues with the current law• No liability for political parties: It only punishes legislators for switching parties. Political parties who are at the heart of the politics have no liability under the law. They benefit from defections and are often accused of enticing legislators of rival parties to switch loyalties.• Problem with merger provision: It safeguards the members of a political party where the original party merges with another party subject to the condition that at least two-third of the members have agreed to such merger. o The exception is based on the number of members rather than the reason behind the defection. • Power to the presiding officer: The presiding officer has been given wide and absolute powers to decide the case related to disqualification of the members on the grounds of defection. However, Speaker still remains the member of the party which had nominated him/her for the post raising concerns regarding his/her impartiality. International scenario on Anti Defection Law• Among the Commonwealth countries, anti-defection law isprevalent in 23 nations. The anti-defection law in Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, and Singapore disqualifies a legislator on his ceasing to be member of the party or when he is expelled.• The perceptible presence of anti-defection laws in countries where democracy is in a growing stage indicate that the legislators in those countries are less informed on the principles of democracy.• But the political ambience in developed democracies poses a picture of legislators with democratic values. o In the UK Parliament, a member is free to cross over to the other side, without being daunted by any disqualification law. o In the US, Canada, and Australia, there is no restraint on legislators switching sides.
11 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 
o Further, s/he may not have legal knowledge and expertise to look upon and perform such acts in such cases.• Unable to curb instability: With not enough room for elected representatives to harbour a difference of opinion, en-masse departures of rebelling legislators have become the ‘political’ normal. Along with uprooting incumbent governments, such departures can also bring governance to a grinding halt.• Expulsion does not attract disqualification: The law focuses on voluntary defection and remains silent about expulsion of a member from the party. Once expelled, such a member would then be an independent in the House, with an option of joining another party, which presents a possible loophole for exploitation of the Schedule.How has the law been interpreted by the Courts while deciding on related matters?• Interpretation of the phrase ‘Voluntarily gives up his membership’: The phrase has a wider connotation than resignation.The Supreme Court has interpreted that in the absence of a formal resignation by the member, the giving up of membership can be inferred by his conduct.o Members who have publicly expressed opposition to their party or support for another party should deemed to have resigned.• Decision of the Presiding officer is subject to Judicial Review: The law initially stated that the decision of the Presiding Officer is not subject to judicial review. This condition was struck down by the Supreme Court in Kihoto holohan Case, 1992, thereby allowing appeal against the Presiding Officer’s decision in the High Court and Supreme Court.o However, it held that there may not be any judicial intervention until the Presiding Officer gives his order.• Time limit within which the Presiding Officer has to decide: The law does not specify a time-period for the Presiding Officer to decide on a disqualification plea. Courts have expressed concern about the unnecessary delay in deciding such petitions. High Courts can direct Speakers to rule on disqualification petitions if they do not do this within reasonable time.What can be done to overcome these issues?• Narrowing the definition of defection: Defining actions or conduct (on the part of legislators) which constitutes defection, in a manner that does not inhibit them to independently think and express their opinions. This will ensure that dissent among party members does not necessarily translate into instability and disagreement does not become a ground for disqualification. o Several experts have suggested that the law should be valid only for those votes that determine the stability of the government (passage of the annual budget or no-confidence motions).• Intra party democracy: Changes are required in the Representation of People Act and the current political cultureto make political parties more democratic in the selection of their leadership. This will indirectly create more acceptance for divergence of opinion and stance within the party. • Involvement of Ethics committee: The active involvement of the Ethics Committee, as done in the Cash for Query scam, can help in curbing horse trading of legislators. If every incident of defection tainted with monetary factors is inquired into and dealt with by Ethics Committee, practice of floor crossing can be contained to a great extent.o In cash for query incident (2005) Members of Parliament accepted money from stakeholders and raised questions in Parliament apparently to the benefit of money givers.• Deciding authority: 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission’s has recommended that the issue of disqualification of members on grounds of defection should be decided by the President/Governor on the advice of the Election Commission.• Making defection an internal issue of party: The imposition of sanctions can be watered down in India to only allow expulsion of a defecting member from his party without costing him his seat in the Parliament and by making it an internal issue of every political party.• Bring more clarity: The law must explicitly set out what it means by the words ‘voluntarily giving up Membership’ in order to avoid any confusion.ConclusionThe Parliament should recheck whether the anti-defection law in current form can achieve the goals for which it was enacted. If not, a discourse can be started for developing a consensus on why it has not been able to achieve its goals and moving ahead, where should we take this law. 12 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 1.5. NEWS IN SHORTS1.5.1. FURLOUGH NOT PRISONER’S RIGHT, SAYS SUPREME COURT (SC)• Reversing a Gujarat High Court order granting relief to a convict, SC discussed differences between 'furlough' and 'parole' and the principles relating to grant of them.o Furlough and parole (covered under The Prisons Act of 1894) envisage a short-term temporary release from custody. Both were introduced with a view to humanising the prison system.o While parole is granted to the prisoner to meet a specific exigency, furlough may be granted (after a stipulated number of years have been served) without any reason.o Period of furlough granted to a prisoner is treated as remission of his sentence. Whereas parole is a system of releasing a prisoner with suspension of the sentence.• SC stated that although furlough can be claimed without a reason, prisoner does not have an absolute legal right to claim furlough.o Grant of furlough must be balanced against the public interest and can be refused to certain categories of prisoners.o Prisoners convicted of multiple murders or under the anti-terror Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) are not eligible for parole.• Prisons Act of each state government (Prison is a state subject) defines the rules under which parole is granted in that state.13 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Efforts by India in development cooperation• Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, India’s capacity-building initiative was constituted in 1964 and emerged as a prominent aspect of the development cooperation by 2015.• India Aid Mission (IAM) launched in Nepal in 1952.• ‘New, Emerging and Strategic Technologies’ (NEST) division is being set to facilitate collaboration with foreign countries on advanced technologies, as well as geographical divisions for better coordination.• In Ethiopia, India provided better quality germplasm, new technology for processing and access to markets, apart from support for packaging for better access to European markets.• India has been supporting the developmental endeavours of several partner countries in Africa and Asia.2. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS2.1. INDIA’S DEVELOPMENT COOPERATIONWhy in News?Enhancing the efficacy of India’s development cooperation endeavors has been a challenging issue for the past several decades.Background• The first effort by India to shape a framework for India’s development cooperation was in 2003 with the announcement of the India Development Initiative (IDI). • Subsequently, the Indian Development and Economic Assistance Scheme (IDEAS) was launched in 2005 for managing credit lines. • In 2007, Govt suspended IDI and announced the setting up of the India International Development Cooperation Agency (IIDCA), which never took off.• There has been clear lack of firm institutional foundation to support India’s Development Cooperation.• India needs a clear vision to lead a sustainable development agenda while positioning itself as a global power with interests beyond its immediate neighborhood. o To achieve this, there is an urgent need to push for reforms in existing institutional structures on development cooperation. India’s development cooperation• Indian model of developmental cooperation is comprehensive and involves multiple instruments including grant-in-aid, line of credit and capacity building and technical assistance. o Depending on the priorities of partner countries, India’s development cooperation ranges from commerce to culture, energy to engineering, health to housing, IT to infrastructure, sports to science, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance to restoration and preservation of cultural and heritage assets.• Currently, India’s development cooperation objectives are broadly based on the South-South cooperation (SSC) framework — a technical cooperation tool among the developing countries in the Global South.• Although the allocation is less than 1% of India’s overall budget, it is still a significant contribution as compared to other high-income countries, such as Australia (US$ 2.8 billion, 0.22 percent of GDP), South Korea (0.15 percent of GDP) and Austria (0.27 percent of GDP), considering India’s US$ 2 billion in credit lines.• The Development Partnership Administration (DPA), housed within the Ministry of External Affairs, is responsible for the overall management, coordination and administration of India’s development partnerships• In the last couple of years, India’s assistance to other developing countries has multiplied several times. o On average, India provides development assistance of $6.48 billion and receives assistance of $6.09 billion annually from key partners as Official Development Assistance (ODA).o ODA involves financial or technical help given by one country’s government to another country to assist social and economic development or to respond to a disaster in the receiving country.Need for India’s development cooperation Agency• Evolution in geopolitics: Future economic diplomacy agencies will have to be located in a new geopolitical dimension that goes far beyond the impulse of the Bandung Conference of 1955, which set up cooperation channels between Asia and Africa in the colonial and post-colonial era.14 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Post pandemic opportunity: Post-pandemic, countries worldwide are exploring ways to reinvigorate their development cooperation efforts. This gels well with the increase in the scope of development cooperation following higher economic growth and rising trade and investment flows to emerging markets and developing economies.• Enhancing Bilateral relations: India’s development cooperation is moving towards a need-driven approach where meeting the partner country’s development objectives goes hand-in-hand with India’s objective for strengthening the bilateral relationships through private sector investments.• Effective Accountability and evaluation framework: As India’s development cooperation grows, the spending will come under public scrutiny; this requires an effective accountability and evaluation framework. The lack of information disseminated in the public domain about India’s current development cooperation framework has been widely criticised by policy experts. o This opacity makes monitoring and evaluation difficult and creates a credibility crisis.Way Forward• Independent development partnership agency: The proposed new entity should o address better delivery, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, o should engage with new actors, especially from civil society and the private sectoro provide handholding to select performing Indian social enterprises to operate in other countries as well. o facilitate development partnerships between India and other countries. o support partner countries in combating natural disasters (Nepal), political and humanitarian crises (Maldives, Afghanistan), and in building social infrastructure (Kenya, Madagascar).• India’s Development Cooperation Act, 2022: India’s upcoming Development Cooperation Act should reflect that a focused approach towards addressing global crisis is in its national interest.• Restructure development finance apparatus: It is high time India restructures its development finance apparatus for deeper and effective engagement and to address the rapidly evolving newer competitive development financing landscape.• Learn from its own programmes: India’s own development experience is evolving with programmes like the JAM trinity, Ayushman Bharat and other initiatives like Gati Shakti — the learnings from which should be absorbed in the portfolio to be shared with fellow developing countries.2.2. INDIA-CENTRAL ASIAWhy in news?Recently, Foreign minister was in Kyrgyzstan on a bilateral visit, where he announced a $200 million credit line and later attended a meeting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Kazakhstan.India-Central Asia relations: From Past to Present• Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) form a part of India’s extended neighbourhood.• India has several millennia old historical, cultural and civilisational links with Central Asia (Refer timeline). 15 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • India deals with Central Asia at multiple levels. Firstly, at the bilateral level, secondly, at the multilateral levelthrough platforms such as the SCO, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) and the United Nations. Thirdly, multi-layered engagement between India and Central Asia such as the India  Central Asia Dialogue at the foreign minister’s level.Significance of Central Asia for India• Natural and mineral resources: These countries are endowed with commercially viable quantities of most minerals like coal, oil, gas, uranium, gold, lead, zinc, iron ore, tin, copper, manganese etc. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have enormous hydel resources. Thus, the region can help in India’s quest for energy security.• Geostrategic: Traditionally, Central Asia has been an arena of "great game". The modern version is being played out even today. Russia, China, US, Turkey, Iran, Europe, EU, Japan, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan have all substantial security and economic interests in the region. o Also, the region lies at the crossroads of Russia, the Middle East, South Asia and the Far East. Any geopolitical changes in the region inevitably extend their impact on several states in the neighbourhood.• Security: Peace and stability in the region is crucial factor for India's security as challenges to Indian security have traditionally come overland from the northwest. Illegal Drug trade emanating from ‘Golden Crescent’ of opium production (Iran-Pak-Afghan) is threat to regional security.o Religious extremism, fundamentalism and terrorism are other challenges. Any advance by Islamic extremist groups in the region could invigorate similar elements active in Kashmir.• Agriculture: Central Asia has huge cultivable areas lying barren and without being put to any productive use. Uzbekistan alone offers an enormous opportunity for cultivation of pulses. Indian agribusiness companies can setup commercial agro-industrial complexes in Central Asia.16 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Trade and Investment: Central Asia is a huge consumer market for a range of goods and services, which India can provide. For India, economic cooperation is possible through joint ventures in banking, insurance, agriculture, information technology, and the pharmaceutical industry.o Large Indian companies can bid for road and railway construction, electric power transmission and distribution, telecommunications, power generation, etc.o Import of spices from Central Asia could increase the volume of trade between Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, on the one hand, and India, on the other.Challenges in development of India-Central Asian relationships• Poor connectivity: The key constraint India faces is the lack of direct access to Central Asia. The adverse geographic terrain and the thorny India-Pakistan border dynamic, greatly impedes connectivity, thereby curbing greater economic cooperation between India and the region.o Further, planned connectivity projects are facing serious financial, political, and security challenges, frustrating oil, and gas diplomacy. • Unrealised trade potential: India’s trade with the region amounts to US$ 2 billion, owing to limited connectivity and low economic engagement with the region. This amount is less than 0.5 percent of India’s total trade, whereas the region’s trade with China amounts to US$ 100 billion. o Besides the physical barriers, factors such as trade regulatory hindrances and political fragility have often created obstacles in the free flow of trade within the region.• Energy geopolitics: Various reports suggest Indo-Pacific region will become increasingly reliant on oil from the Middle East and Central Asia. The scramble for oil and gas in Central Asia has attracted several actors in the region. The presence of major powers in the region constrains India as a latecomer.o China has emerged as the dominant player, as compared to India, by providing loans and investing heavilyin the region through ambitious projects like Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).• Volatile Security scenario: In addition to traditional security threats, instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan, concerns regarding confrontation between Iran and the United States, diminishes reliability and safety required for trade and commerce, discouraging investments.• Internal dynamics: Delineation of borders by communist leadership overlooked many ethnic, tribal, linguistic, geographical, and even economic factors. Consequently, the post-soviet era saw problems of governance, regulation of movement across the borders and many inter-state disputes.o The fall in the oil and commodity prices, compounded by Western sanctions on Russia, has, however, impacted the economies of the Central Asian countries. Ways to enhance the relationships• Deepening engagement: India could take the initiative to set up an India-Central Asia Forum Summit on the lines of the India-Africa Forum Summit to discuss issues of mutual concern and to come up with concrete suggestions. o India should also facilitate the setting up of India-Central Asia Think Tank Forum to discuss and debate economics, history, politics, and business at the Track-2 level. o In economic realm, it is in India’s interest to expeditiously finalise the much-awaited Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between India and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).• Revitalizing interaction in cooperation with third countries: There is a possibility of India, the US and Russia cooperating in areas such as non-conventional sources of energy, thus containing the dangers of drug trafficking and other negative activities. o This will go a long way in stabilising the region, as well as ensuring the interests of all partners.• Defence cooperation: Apart from annual exercises (like KAZIND with Kazakhstan), joint manufacturing, especially in the defence sector is highly required. Defence cooperation should be institutionalised through mechanisms like setting up a Joint Working Group on defence related activities. An India-Central Asia Defence Expo could be organised.• Capacity Building: India can strengthen its outreach in Central Asia by providing assistance in augmenting the Social Capital through programs like the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). MEA should prepare a proper database of former students/ trainees of these programs. 17 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Connectivity efforts by India• International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) agreement in 2000 also offers connectivity between India and Central Asia through Iran.• India has also explored the possibility of connecting with Central Asia via Iran’s Chabahar port and thereafter overland corridors passing through Afghanistan.• To facilitate transport of goods between India and Central Asia via Iran, India acceded to the Customs Convention on International Transport of Goods under cover of TIR Carnets in 2017 and joined the Ashgabat Agreement, which includes Iran, Oman, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in 2018.o Under High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDP), India provides Grant assistance for furthering socio-economic development.o India’s rich experience in managing the local-self  government can also be helpful to Central Asian countries where mahalla culture (local self  government) is widely prevalent.• Soft-diplomacy approach: In contrast to China’s images as a coercive-assertive hegemon, debt-trap diplomacy and rising anti-China sentiments amongst the population of the region, India can use its soft diplomacy to take the opportunities presented in the region.ConclusionWith the actualization of the BRI, India’s Connect Central Asia policy, and the EU’s new Central Asia strategy, the 21st century could possibly be the most decisive period for the region. Stemming from its historic cultural and economic bonds, India is now well placed to take a more active role in the development of the region. 2.3. NEWS IN SHORTS2.3.1.

It failed, for instance, to see the signs of the Asian currency crisis.• Developing countries are subjected to far more rigorous Article IV consultation process and scrutiny than the more developed countries, and the most curious example is, that in Spain and Greece.• IMF should focus on lower income countries and support other developing countries’ market funds raising activities.Governance Reforms• Board of Governors is the highest decision-making body of the IMF.• Board is advised by two ministerial committees, the International Monetary and Financial Committee(IMFC) and the Development Committee.• Governance structure continues to be disproportionately dominated by advanced economies.• These countries choose the leadershipand senior management, and so their interests dominate, despite the fact that the main borrowers are developing countries.• Many of the economic reforms IMF required as conditions for its lending (fiscal austerity, trade liberalization etc.) have often been counterproductive for target economies.• Need to shift the focus from the needs of the USA and European countries to those of developing countries by reforming the voting structure.Reforms in World BankGovernance related• Dominance of US and other members of the G7 in voting and administration do not take into account significant changes in the profiles of major economic actors such as India and China.• Critics see the World Bank together with the other global economic institutions as an imperialism tool which protect the interests and ideas of the western rich countries and expands their dominance in the rest of the world.21 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Structural Adjustment Programs (SAP)• SAPs imposed by both IMF and the World Bank severely affected the developing countries.• SAPs enforced privatization of industries, cuts in government spending and imposition of user fees,market-based pricing, higher interest rates and trade liberalization.o This has resulted in slow growth, higher poverty, lower incomes, increased debt burdens, low human development indicators and deteriorating social services in many developing countries.Redefining purpose• World Bank has not been able to redefine its purpose as a lending and developmental institution in light of the emergence of non-traditional lenders such as China.o Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), established by China, is a multilateral development bank that focuses on infrastructure financing, exactly the sort of work the World Bank does.Transparency in functioning• Both the World Bank and IMF are obscure and have little to open to the world in terms of documents and information.• The reliability of World Bank reports, and its predictions on economic performances have been questioned.ConclusionDeep reforms of the World Bank and IMF are necessary as part of rethinking the current world order, and giving rising powers and developing countries a meaningful voice in this institution.Failure to adapt to the changing world order could see rising powers going their own way. Such a development would signify the emergence of multipolarity without multilateralism and create a climate of conflicting interests and values among a diverse group of countries.These institutions have an important role to play in the developing world.

WIDENING ECONOMIC INEQUALITIESWhy in News?Recently, China started a ‘common prosperity’ program to narrow the widening wealth gap between people with stringent measures on how business and society should function.About Economic Inequality (or Wealth Gap)• Economic inequality is the unequal distribution of income or opportunity in a population or groups of a society. E.g., If we talk of income inequality, i.e., how unevenly income is distributed throughout a population, income inequality between the richest 10% and poorest 10% in OECD countries increased from 7.2 times of mid-1980s to 9.6 times in 2013.22 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Related Reports:The Changing Wealth of Nations 2021: World Bank• Report tracks wealth of 146 countries between 1995 and 2018, by measuring economic value of renewable natural capital, non-renewable natural capital, human capital, produced capital, and net foreign assets.• Key findingo Global wealth grew significantly between 1995 and 2018, but the risks faced (from unsustainable exploitation, lack of collective action etc.) have also increased.✓ While total wealth has increased everywhere, albeit with a widening gap between nations, per capita wealth has not.World Inequality Report 2022: The World Inequality Lab• Key Findingso Top 10% of the global population owns 76% of total household wealth and captured 52% of total income in 2021.o Bottom 50% of the global population owns just 2% of wealth and 8% of income.o Women make just a third of global labour incomes, which has seen very limited change since 1990.o A very moderate wealth tax for global billionaires can generate 1.6% of global income.○ The Gini index, or Gini coefficient, is used as a popular tool to measure income distribution inequalities globally. The coefficient ranges from 0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. Values over 1 are theoretically possible due to negative income or wealth.• Changes in global inequality: Inequality across all individuals in the world declined for the first time in the 1990s since the 1820s as the developing world started to grow faster than developed countries.o But the pandemic threatens to undo those gains, widening the gap between rich and poor nations once again by slowing the growth of developing countries.• Inequality within nations: Within developing nations, the inequalities have increased significantly. E.g., In India, the top 10% holds 77% of national wealth. In comparison, the poorest 67 million Indians saw only 1% increase in wealth.Impact of persistent Economic Inequality• Increased Social Polarizations: Due to stagnant or reduced social mobilities due to widening economic inequality the polarization in society increases. For India, with an already fractured society over religion, region, gender, or caste, it adds another fracture point.○ Growing income inequality may increase social segmentation.Also, the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable sections gets jeopardized due to lack of quality health and education facilities.• Economic Risks: High economic inequalities are a drag on long term economic growth and equality of opportunities, leading to risks of-○ mass poverty with higher number of young population experiencing poverty, ○ reduced state’s ability to protect their poor and vulnerable sections, and○ increased demands for Deglobalization and Nationalization.• Political Risks: Economic inequalities between people lead to marginalization of segments of population in policy decisions, ability to question policies and processes.• Security Risks: Globally, the economic inequalities lead to widening of power gap between nations, enhancing risks of war among nations. E.g., the recent India-China border issues.• Environment Risk: Economic inequalities lead to inequitable and unjust development with risks of damaging wetlands, increased river pollution etc.23 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Initiatives to reduce Economic InequalityChallenges in removing economic inequalities• Income differences reflect individual efforts: The recent rise of startups highlight money as an incentive of knowledge. State redistributive policies could curb individual incentives, reducing wealth generation in an economy.• Income differences are accumulated by generations: The economic inequalities are significant reflections of differences between their parents and previous generations. Whether it is the number of children, expenditure on education, health etc. varies even within people under the same income group.• Historical differences: Usually, high income inequality regions or nations tend to have low intergenerational mobility. As these regions fail to offer adequate opportunities for socio-economic mobility. • Monetary Resource Constraints: Economic inequalities lead to issues of informal economy, presence of parallel economy (Black Money), tax evasions, small tax base etc., limiting public finances and resources available for redistributive policies from state.• Human Capital Constraints: Higher inequality decreases human capital accumulation as well, it leads to a vicious cycle of low income, low productivity, low taxes, and low human capital.• Wealth Redistribution Challenges: How to redistribute wealth for best outcome is a challenge. Whether it should focus on disparities between top versus bottom or greater focus should be on the middle class to leverage the rise in economic activities for higher tax base is a difficult question to answer.Way ForwardOpen and fair competition is an essential ingredient for any reform to tackle inequalities and promote equal opportunities for long-term sustainability.

CAPITAL ACCOUNT CONVERTIBILITY (CAC)Why in news?Deputy Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently indicated towards fundamental shifts in the capital account convertibility framework in India, resurrecting a debate relating to Capital account liberalization.What does capital account convertibility (CAC) mean?• Convertibility refers to the ability to convert domestic currency into foreign currencies and vice versa to make payments for balance of payments transactions.• Thus, CAC is the ability or freedom to convert domestic currency for capital account transactions.• Capital account liberalization is the process of removing impediments to inflows of capital, or allowing domestic investors to invest more freely in foreign assets.o A full CAC allows local currency to be exchanged for foreign currency without any restriction on the amount.• Regulation of CAC: o India has cautiously opened up its capital account since the early 1990s and presently there exists a partial capital account convertibility in India.o Several committees have been established by the RBI in the past to recommend a pathway towards fuller CAC including-✓ Committee on CAC, 1997 (Tarapore Committee, 1997) recommended full CAC for 1999-2000 based on fulfilment of certain benchmarks related to Fiscal Deficit, Inflation, Non-Performing Asset (NPA) etc.✓ Committee on Fuller CAC, 2006 (Tarapore Committee, 2006) suggested measures for gradual capital account liberalisation.Steps taken to move towards fuller CAC• Introduction of the Fully Accessible Route (FAR), which places no limit on non-resident investment in specified Government securities (G-Secs). • Allowing trade in non-convertible forward (NDF) rupee market: The RBI permitted banks in India, which operate International Financial Services Centre Banking Units (IBUs), to participate in the NDF market.o An NDF is a foreign exchange derivative contract, which allows investors to trade in non-convertible currencies, with contract settlement in a convertible currency. NDFs trade principally beyond the borders of the currency’s home jurisdiction, enabling investors to transact outside the regulatory framework of the home market.• Liberalised Remittance Scheme allows all resident individuals, including minors, to freely remit up to USD 2,50,000 per financial year for any permissible current or capital account transaction or a combination of both.• Rationalisation of External Commercial Borrowing (ECB): Steps taken by RBI include  o Replacing the system of sector wise limits: All entities eligible to receiveFDIhavebeenpermittedto raise ECBs up to USD 750 million per financial year under automatic route subject to certain terms and conditions prescribed in the Guidelines.25 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS pdf pg 27o Relaxed the end-use restrictions related to ECBs: allowing corporates and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to raise ECBs for working capital and general corporate purposes.• Foreign Direct Investment has been made more or less unrestricted except (i) for some sectoral caps and (ii) restrictions in a few socially sensitive (e.g., gambling) or volatile (e.g., real estate) or strategic (e.g., atomic energy) sectors.

### Benefits associated with CAC
- • Facilitates economic growth: CAC opens up markets to global players including investors, businesses, and trade 
- partners, leading to enhanced investment flows which in turn leads to economic benefits like to Improved liquidity in financial markets and better risk allocation.
o Reduction in the cost of both foreign equity and debt capital. 
o Offshore rupee market development.
o Improved employment and business opportunities.
o Positive pressures for better infrastructure and business practices. 
• Improves the efficiency of the financial sector: as openness to capital flows can  o expose a country’s financial sector to greater competition. 
o spur improvements in domestic corporate governance to meet standards of foreign investors.
o impose discipline on macroeconomic policies, and the government.
• Other benefits:
o Provides opportunities for diversification of investments by residents. 
o Enhances credibility of national economy as CAC is seen as a sign of stable and mature markets.
o Enables higher stock market returns.
o Reduction in transaction cost due to free rupee convertibility. 
o Improvement in domestic savings and investments.
o Better access to a global variety of goods and services.
Risks associated with free capital mobility 
• Exchange rate volatility: A lack of suitable regulatory control and rates subject to open markets with a large number 
of global market participants can lead to sudden exit of capital causing volatility, devaluation, or inflation in forex.
• Unsustainable Foreign Debts: Businesses are prone to the risk of high repayments in case of foreign debt if 
exchange rates become unfavorable. 
• Credit and asset bubbles: Foreign investors may use equity markets in emerging countries to bet on currency 
appreciation, thereby distorting asset values and adding to the risk of speculative bubbles.
• Exposure to global macroeconomic shocks: Fuller CAC exacerbates risks associated with Global financial crises, 
especially for emerging economies like India. 
o For instance, the 1997 Asian financial crisis was exacerbated because the countries affected had full capital 
account convertibility and the financial crisis of 2008 led to huge foreign capital outflows from emerging 
countries.
• Effects on Balance of Trade and Exports: Substantial inflows could lead to an overvalued exchange rate which can 
make Indian exports less competitive in the international markets. 
• Lack of effectiveness in generating growth: Foreign capital inflows by themselves only have temporary effects on 
growth because productivity growth is the main determinant of long-term growth which needs robust 
infrastructure, ease of business, technological advancements etc.
### Is India ready for a full/fuller CAC?
Several economic parameters have considerably improved in  India, indicating a readiness to fuller CAC-
• burgeoning [[forex reserve]]s of around $640 billion.
• higher increase in FDI flows than unstable portfolio flows  (see graph). 
• low current account deficit (CAD) ~1.0 per cent of GDP in  fourth quarter of 2020-21.

About [[BISAG Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space]]
Applications and Geoinformatics (BISAG)
• It is a Gandhinagar-based autonomous scientific  society under the Ministry of Electronics &  Information Technology.
• It undertakes projects in satellite communication, geo-informatics and geo-spatial technologies.
- But strain on India’s macroeconomic situation is evident by high Fiscal deficit (9.3 per cent for 2020-21) and  inflation (4.48% in October of 2021). Further, increase in international oil prices and the pace of economic recovery post  COVID-19, can substantially increase CAD. Thus, India needs a pragmatic approach towards CA liberalization, as  underlined below-
- • Proceeding in a phased manner: Gradually, through the Fully Accessible Route, the entire G-sec issuance can be 
- eligible for non-resident investment.
- o External borrowing can be controlled until corporate governance and supervisory standards are robust.
- • Develop a System of Checks and balances to deal with the risks of CAC:
- o Tools to manage the volume and composition of capital inflows.
- o Macro prudential tools like counter cyclical capital buffers.
- o Proper mechanism for information flow so that exchange and interest rate management can continue to be 
- effective in an environment of larger offshore transactions.
- • Preparing market participants, particularly banks, to manage the business process changes and the global risks 
- associated with capital convertibility.
- • Developing sound macroeconomic fundamentals: Recommendations of Committee on Fuller CAC, 2006 (Tarapore 
- Committee, 2006) in this regard include o Earmarking substantial part of the revenue surplus of the Centre for meeting the repayment liability under the 
- Centre’s market borrowing programme.
- o Central Government and the States should graduate from the present system of computing the fiscal deficit to a 
- measure of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR).
- o Setting up an Office of Public Debt to function independently outside the RBI.
- • Strengthening business environment: A fuller CAC would culminate into higher growth facilitated by factors like 
- quick bankruptcy proceedings, infrastructural growth, streamlining FDI transactions, tax clarity and policy certainty 
- etc.
## Conclusion
India has come a long way in achieving increasing levels of convertibility on the capital account. It has broadly achieved 
the desired outcome for the policy choices, in terms of achieving a stable composition of foreign capital inflow. At the 
same time, India is on the cusp of some fundamental shifts in this space. The rate of change in capital convertibility will 
only increase with each of these and similar measures. 
With that comes the responsibility to ensure that such flows are managed effectively with the right combination of 
capital flow measures, macro-prudential measures and market intervention.
# 3.4. GATI SHAKTI
Why in News?
Recently, The Prime Minister launched the Rs 100-trillion Gati Shakti or the National Master Plan for multimodal  connectivity to expedite infrastructure project implementation in India.
About Gati Shakti 
• It is essentially a digital platform to bring 15 Ministries together (including Railways and Roadways) for integrated 
planning and coordinated implementation of infrastructure  connectivity projects.
• An integrated multimodal Network Planning Group (NPG) will be responsible for unified planning and integration of  proposals
• This entire platform has been developed by the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications  and Geoinformatics (BISAG).

27 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 

How will Gati Shakti help in overcoming bottlenecks and challenges associated with development of Multi-Model 
connectivity infrastructure in India?
28 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 
Conclusion
Coming close on the heels of the National Infrastructure Pipeline and the National Monetisation Plan, the Gati Shakti 
vision will underscore the primacy of place on development of world-class infra facilities crucial to improving business 
sentiment and speeding up the country’s vision to emerge a $5-trillion economy soon.
3.5. OPEN NETWORK FOR DIGITAL COMMERCE 
Why in News?
The [[DPIIT Department for promotion of industry and internal trade]] in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is 
building an Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC).
## About ONDC
• ONDC is envisaged as a neutral platform that will set protocols for cataloguing, vendor match, and price discovery 
in open source on the lines of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). o It will enable buyers and sellers to be digitally visible and transact through an open network no matter what platform/application they use.
• Aim: To democratize digital commerce, moving it away from platform-centric models like Amazon and Flipkart to  an open network.
• An advisory council on ONDC has been constituted by the Centre to take over as a guide and mentor for its design,  implementation and national rollout of ONDC.
o A private sector-led non-profit unit will also be set up to fast-track its roll-out.
## Key Features of the Proposed ONDC
• Measures to ensure confidentiality & privacy of data in the network, including o Sharing of any transaction-level data by participants with ONDC will not be mandatory. o It will work with its participants to publish anonymised aggregate metrics on network performance without  compromising on confidentiality and privacy.
o It will be compliant with the Information Technology Act, 2000 and designed for compliance with the emerging 
Personal Data Protection Bill.
• Plan for a well developed Information, Education & Communication campaign to educate, encourage and to 
address any apprehensions of various network participants.
• Special attention to help onboard small and medium players will be given initially.
• It is expected to evolve over time as a self-sustaining entity generating income for its operations and surplus for 
continuous investment in technology, processes and network development.
## What does open-source mean?
• Making a software or a process open-source means that the code or the steps of that process is made  available freely for others to use, redistribute and  modify it.
• For example, while the operating system of Apple’s iPhones — iOS — is closed source, meaning it  cannot be legally modified or reverse engineered, Google’s Android operating system is open-source, and therefore it is possible by smartphone  manufacturers such as Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus,  etc. to modify it for their hardware.

29 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
## Intended Benefits of ONDC
• Ending monopolistic tendencies: Many big e-commerce companies have been accused of discriminating among sellers on  their platforms and promoting certain seller entities in which they  hold indirect stakes. ONDC will level the playing field and empower  merchants and consumers by breaking silos to form a single  network.
• Interoperability: An open digital infrastructure will make e  commerce highly interoperable for sellers and customers who want to connect with each other, without the barrier of making an  effort of switching between two or more marketplaces for a  particular product.
• Enhanced Discoverability for small retailers: Once a retailer lists its products or services using the ONDC’s open protocol, the  business can be discovered by consumers on e-commerce  platforms that follow the same protocol. 
• Increasing efficiency in logistics movement: It would help in standardizing operations and promote inclusion of 
local suppliers which would drive efficiencies in logistics and lead to enhancement of value for consumers.
• Ease of doing business: Businesses are expected to benefit from transparent rules, lightweight investment, and 
lower cost of business acquisition.
o It is also expected that the time-to-market as well as time-to-scale shall also be substantially reduced.
• Faster adoption of digital means: It would encourage easy adoption of digital means by those currently not on 
digital commerce networks.
Way Forward
• Technical Decentralization: The government should restrict its role to facilitating standards and protocols that 
provide open access.
• Minimal personal data collection: Data exchange protocols should be designed to minimize friction but be based on 
clear rules that protect the consumer interest i.e., the platform should be built on “privacy by design” principles.
• Utilizing new technologies: For instance, tools like blockchain could be used to build technical safeguards that 
cannot be overridden without active consent.
• Reference application: Creation of non-mandatory “reference applications" for organic adoption of the network, 
similar to BHIM App, can be done.
• Supplementing with tightly-tailored regulations: such as passing the data protection bill and creating an 
independent regulator should be a precondition.
## 3.6. ROAD SAFETY
Why in news?
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has notified constitution of the National Road Safety Board. About [[national road safety board]]
- • It **shall consist of the Chairman and not less than three, but not exceeding seven Members, to be appointed by the  Central Government.**
• The functions of the board, inter alia, are:
	o Formulate specific standards for road safety, traffic management and road construction for hilly region and  guidelines for capacity building of traffic police, highway authorities etc.
	o Formulate Guidelines for establishing and operating trauma facilities and para-medical facilities, for  consideration by the Central Government.
	o Provide technical advice and assistance, promote good Samaritans and good practices and conduct research for road safety and traffic management.

## Concerns regarding ONDC
• Unnecessary intervention: In general, governments should intervene in markets  only when there is a clearly identifiable  market failure or massive societal benefits  from creating shared infrastructure.
• Protest from private entities: Larger e  commerce giants are protesting as they have already invested heavily in the R&D  as well as deployment of their own  processes and technology.
• Privacy and security concerns: Such open network may lead to collection of personal  data which may have privacy issues and its  open nature may expose it to hackers.

30 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 
 
 o Promote consistency between international technical standards and domestic technical  standards. The problem of Road Accidents: Globally and in India • Global Statistics: According to a World Bank report  (2021), road accidents globally injure more than  3000 persons every day.  o Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) are the 8th leading 
cause of death globally.o The risk of a road crash in low-income countries is three times higher than compared to that in high-income countries.o India tops the world in road crash deaths (WHO, 2018), with more than 400 fatalities per day.• Road accidents in India: According to MoRTH, Road accidents in India kill almost 1.5 lakh people annually. India has 1% of the world’s vehicles but accounts for 11% of all road accident deaths.o In the last decade alone, road crashes have killed 1.3 million and injured over 5 million in India. o Road accidents in 2019 compared to the previous year i.e., 2018, decreased by 3.86 percent.• Type of road accident: Of the total number of accidents in 2019, Minor injuries accounted for the largest share of about 35%, followed by fatal accidents of about 31% with Grievous injuries accounting for another 28%.o Grievous injury accident is one in which one or more victims suffer serious injury requiring hospitalization. • Economic cost: 2019 World Bank report puts the road crash and serious injury cost estimate at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP for 2016. It is more than twice the figure cited by the government at 3 per cent of GDP.Measures taken by MoRTH to improve road safety and ameliorate the impact of road accidentsI. VISION ZERO• The Ministry has formulated a comprehensive National Road Safety Strategy to address the issue of road safety which provides the framework for National collaboration on road safety improvement and allow for a move towards VISION ZERO.• This strategy covered themes on Education, Publicity and awareness campaigns, Engineering (both of roads and vehicles), Enforcement and Emergency Care.II.

To achieve this goal and make every road safer for everyone at all times, all areas will have to be explored from technological, institutional to psychological perspective. 32 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Initiatives taken for better implementation of MGNREGA• MGNREGA Tracker — by using the government’s Management Information System (MIS) data.• NREGAsoft is a local language enabled work flow based e-Governance system which makes available all the documents like Muster Rolls, registration application register, job card/employment register etc.• Project 'LIFE-MGNREGA' (Livelihood In Full Employment)aims to promote self- reliance and improving the skill base of the MGNREGA workers, and thereby improving the livelihood of the workersFor instance, in Germany, a computerised point system for traffic violations is in place. This is accompanied by warnings in the form of demerit points to tend the behaviour. Once there are eight demerit points, the licence is revoked, thus kicking in the institutional mechanism. An integrated system like this, nudges the users away from traffic violence at every stage. 3.7. MAHATMA GANDHI NATIONAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE ACT (MGNREGA)Why in news?MGNREGA ran out of funds halfway through the financial year.More about News• MGNREGA shows a negative net balance of ₹8,686 crore.• Almost 90% of the allocated budget for the year has been used up till now, with five months of the programme still remaining.• Further, payments for MGNREGA workers as well as material costs will be delayed, unless States dip into their own funds. About MGNREGA• It is demand driven wage employment programme under the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD).• It provides at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. • Core objectives of the MGNREGS are: o creation of productive assets of prescribed quality and durability; o Strengthening the livelihood resource base of the poor; o Proactively ensuring social inclusiono Strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions. • It is bottom-up, people- centred, self  selecting and rights-based programme.• Plans and decisions regarding the nature and choice of works to be undertaken, the order in which each worksite selection etc., are all to be made in open assemblies of the Gram Sabha (GS) and ratified by the Gram Panchayats. • Assets created under the programme include works related to natural resource management such as water conservation, land development and irrigation. o Besides these, dams, irrigation channels, check dams, ponds, wells and anganwadis are also built under the scheme.• Important legislative provisions of MGNREGAo Work should be provided within 15 days of demanding work failing which the workers are entitled to an unemployment allowance. o Workers should be paid within 15 days of completion of work, failing which they are entitled to compensation for the delays.• Social audit creates accountability of performance, especially towards immediate stakeholders.33 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Strength of MGNREGA• Addressing the informal economy: MGNREGA’s performance is possibly the most important proxy for the health of the informal economy, which accounts for anywhere between 80% to 90% of all employment in India.• Lifeline during COVID lockdown: During COVID-19 lockdown, the scheme was ultimately given its highest budget of ₹1.11 lakh crore and provided a critical lifeline for a record 11 crore workers.• Backbone of rural economy: It provides supplementary means of livelihood to people in rural areas, primarily during lean periods.• Bottom-up approach: The decentralised nature of MGNREGA enables the planning process for MGNREGA to be bottom-up, starting at the village level in local governments.What are the challenges faced by MGNREGA recently?• Inadequate Allocation and repeated payment delays: Total budget allocation for MGNREGA this year was 34% less than the revised budget of the last financial year (2020-21).o 71% of the payments were delayed beyond the mandated seven-day period at the central government level; 44% exceeded 15 days.• Demand suppression: When rural workers do not get their dues in time, it discourages them to the extent that they do not ask for as much work as they would want to.• Caste-based payment delays: Non-SC, non-ST workers, who account for around 87 per cent of all workers, were facing much longer payment delays. Payment of wages to workers has been erratic and non-uniform, triggering caste-based tensions among MGNREGA workers.o Under the scheme, Union government asks states to give 3 Funds Transfer Orders— one each for MGNREGA workers belonging to “SC” (Scheduled Castes), “ST” (Scheduled Tribes) and “Other” categories.• Lack of Awareness and Capacity among Rural Citizens: The need for capacity building among rural citizens seeking NREGA employment is not well recognized, which may be related to the challenge of inherent capacity building at that level • Inadequate Social Audit and Accountability: In many villages, no social audit has been conducted. The government officials’ especially Assistant Programme Officer shows the social audit process on paper only.Way forward• Revision in scheme: Activist groups have been demanding an increase in the wage rate for MGNREGA schemes; it will be crucial to stopping forced migration.o It will be even more effective if the number of days for guaranteed work can be increased up to 200 days from the current 100 days.• Proper allocation and timely payments: Govt needs to ensure a complete allocation and timely wage payments to works as this scheme impacts the rural economy• Participatory techniques: Such as Process- Influence Mapping can be used to help create a better understanding of the intricacies of implementing complex large-scale programs such as NREGA and to assess possible solutions.• Use of technology: It is another avenue to improve vigilance over program implementation. In fact, Internet and software tools are increasingly considered to be useful means of meeting the demand for data collection and reporting.’o For instance, Bihar uses biometric devices when introducing the e-Muster Roll, with the objective of improving the transparency of Muster Roll entries and ensuring timely and appropriate wage payments

## 3.8. GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX (MPI) 2021
Why in news?Global MPI 2021: Unmasking disparities by ethnicity, caste and gender was released jointly by Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and United Nations34 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) • It is an economic research centre within the Oxford Department of International Development at the University of Oxford. • It aims to build and advance a more systematic methodological and economic framework for reducing multidimensional poverty, grounded in people’s experiences and values. • OPHI’s work is grounded in Amartya Sen’s capability approachand it works to implement this approach by creating real tools that inform policies to reduce poverty.UNDP• It is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.• As the UN’s development agency, UNDP plays a critical role in helping countries achieve the SDGs.• Its work is concentrated on 3 main focus areas:o Sustainable developmento Democratic governance and peacebuildingo Climate and disaster resilience• Headquarters: New York.Development Programme (UNDP).What is Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) ?
• It is an international measure of acute multidimensional poverty covering over 100 developing countries. o Multidimensional poverty measures allow us to see how many households are experiencing deprivations at the same time.• It complements traditional monetary poverty measures by capturing the acute deprivations in health, education, and living standardsthat a person faces simultaneously.• It assesses poverty at the individual level. o If a person is deprived in a third or moreof ten (weighted) indicators, the global MPI identifies them as ‘MPI poor’.o The extent – or intensity – of their poverty is also measured through the percentage of deprivations they are experiencing.• It permits comparisons both across countries and world regions, and within countries by ethnic group, urban/rural area, subnational region, and age group, as well as other key household and community characteristics.• It shows both who is poor –in terms of their age group, subnational region, and whether they live in an urban or rural area -– and how they are poor – in terms of which overlapping deprivations they face.• The global MPI was developed by OPHI with the UNDP for inclusion in UNDP’s flagship Human Development Report in 2010. It has been published annually by OPHI and in the HDRs ever since.• The MPI value summarizes information on multiple deprivations into a single number. This value varies from 0 to 1. o It shows the proportion of deprivations that a country’s poor people experience out of the total possible deprivations that would be experienced if every person in the society were poor and deprived in every indicator. o It is calculated by multiplying the poverty headcount by the intensity of poverty.o India’s MPI value is 0.123.35 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • The MPI constitutes a set of poverty measures. These measures are explained as follows. o Headcount or incidence of multidimensional poverty: the proportion of people who are multidimensionally poor according to the MPI (those who are deprived in at least one third of the weighted indicators). o Intensity of multidimensional poverty: the weighted average number of deprivations poor people experience at the same time.Highlights of Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2021• It examines inequalities along the lines of ethnicity, case and gender across multidimensionally poor people globally. • These disparities are likely to have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.• For the first time the global MPI is disaggregated by ethnicity or race (for 40 countries with available information), by caste (for India) and by gender of the household head (for 108 countries).Global findings India specific findingsGender findings• 2/3rd of multidimensionally poor people – 836 million – live in households in which no girl or woman has completed at least 6 years of schooling.• 1/6th of all multidimensionally poor people (215 million) live in households in which at least 1 boy or man has completed at least 6 years of schooling, but no girl or woman has.• 1 in 6 multidimensionally poor people live in female-headed households.• The incidence of multidimensional poverty is positively associated with the rate of intimate partner violence against women and girls.• In India, close to 12% of the population -- 162 million people -- live in female-headed households.Ethnicity, race and caste findings• Nearly 128 million people belong to ethnic groups in which 70% or more of the population of those groups is multidimensionally poor.• Indigenous peoples are among the poorest in all Latin American countries covered.• 5 out of 6 multidimensionally poor people in India are from lower tribes or castes.• ST group accounts for 9.4% of the population and is the poorest, with 65 million of the 129 million people living in multidimensional poverty.• Following the ST group is the SC group with 33.3% -- 94 million of 283 million people -- living in multidimensional poverty.• 27.2% of the Other Backward Class group -- 160 million of 588 million people -- lives in multidimensional povertyCOVID-19 findings• Emergency social protection coverage is less prevalent in high-MPI countries.• The percentage of employed non-wage workers is particularly high in high-MPI countries.• The percentage of households with children who stopped participating in formal education during the pandemic is larger in higher MPI countries.• The relationship between MPI value and these additional deprivations and socioeconomicrisksisnotuniform:Somehigh  MPIcountriesdefythepattern, against the odds.Multidimensional poverty around the world• Across 109 countries 1.3 billion people— 21.7%—live in acute multidimensional poverty.• About half (644 million) are children under age 18.• Nearly 85% live in Sub-Saharan Africa (556 million) or South Asia (532 million).• Top five countries with the largest number of people living in multidimensional poverty are in India (2015/16) at 381 millions, followed by Nigeria at 93 million, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo.• Roughly, 84% (1.1 billion) live in rural areas, and 16% (about 209 million) live in urban areas.Why Caste has significant implications for poverty and other welfare outcomes? • Lack of education and occupation: This both had ritual significance in that they were the preserve of upper castes. Dalits were usually illiterate, landless and were meant to serve in “impure” occupations passed down through generations.36 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Steps taken in India to eradicate poverty• Integrated Rural Development Programme as a major self-employment scheme.• National Social Assistance Programme with 3 components National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS), National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS) and National MaternityBenefit Scheme (NMBS).• Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee.• Continued discrimination: According to some surveys, even today discrimination against SC students by teachers and by upper caste parents is common in some parts of the country. Dalit children are particularly excluded in  situations involving the  sharing offood and water  and prayers i.e. areas  otherwise considered  permeable to “pollution”  by lower castes.• Engaged in Casual labour: In the labour market, Dalits remain largely in casual  labour. Historically, Dalits  have remained landless  and whilesomestatesinIndiahaveimplemented  land reforms after  independence this has not  been the norm. This has  meant a preponderance of  Dalits in casual labour.Limitations of MPI• The indicators may not reflect capabilities but  instead reflect outputs (such as years of schooling)  or inputs (such as cooking fuel).• The health dimension indicators are not consistently collected across countries and overlook  some groups’ deprivations, especially for nutrition.• Intra-household inequalities may be severe, but these are not captured.• While the MPI goes well beyond a headcount ratio to include the intensity of poverty, it does not measure inequality among the poor.3.9.

TRENCH FARMING• Recently, ASSOCHAM suggested adoption of ‘trench farming’ to grow herbs, vegetables in Ladakh.• Trench is a simple structure for growing vegetables during extreme winters. Trench cultivation harnesses soil and solar heat to create suitable climatic conditions for growth of leafy vegetables like spinach, fenugreek, coriander, lai etc. o A suitable size of 30’ x 10’ x 3’ with transparent UV stabilized 200 micron polythene sheets are used as the technology is low-cost and portable. ✓ The farmers can relocate the trench tunnel to whatever location they want. • Since farming season is very small in Ladakh, the farmers should be informed about alternatives to greenhouses, such as low tunnel technology or trench farming, to help them cultivate herbs and vegetables.• Significance o The commercial cultivation of Indian and exotic vegetables and flowers can be taken up in large greenhouses to meet local demand in such hostile areas. o The produce could be supplied to the rest of the country at a premium since India imports some of these vegetables from other countries.3.9.9. NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICSThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences 2021was given to three economists for two ground-breaking works using ‘natural experiments’.More on news• The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded one half to David Card and the other half jointly to Joshua D. Angrist and Guido W. Imbens.About the prize winning research• Issues such as relation between immigration and employment levels, school education and future earnings of students etc. have remained relevant across time and geographies.• David Card used “natural experiments” (situations arising in real life that resemble randomised experiments) to analyse the labour market effects of minimum wages, immigration and education.o The results showed that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs.o The incomes of people who were born in a country can benefit from new immigration, while people who immigrated at an earlier time risk being negatively affected.o Resources in schools are far more important for students’ future labour market success than previously thought.• The methodology to interpret data and draw conclusions from natural experiments was given by Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens.About Sveriges Riksbank Prize• It was established in 1968 by the Central Bank of Sweden -Sveriges Riksbank, in memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize• The Prize is based on a donation received by the Nobel Foundation in 1968 from Sveriges Riksbank on the occasion of the Bank’s 300th anniversary.3.9.10. NSE-SHINE BULLION BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORM• It is a blockchain platform for gold bullion launched by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) with Chainflux in support with India Gold Policy Centre (IGPC) and the Indian Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).• First for India, the NSE-Shine platform will provide a data framework for bullion bar integrity for settlement of Gold derivatives contracts.o It will also help in ensuring data security, data integrity, and data traceability for each bullion bar ID at any point of time.3.9.11.

## 3.9.14. 100% FDI IN TELECOM SECTOR VIA AUTOMATIC ROUTE
• Recently, government raised foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in telecom sector through the automatic route to 100% from 49% earlier.o Move is aimed at promoting ease of doing business in India.• However, all foreign investments from countries with which India shares land borders or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated, can invest only under government route.41 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS About Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs)India has seven Central-level Armed Police Forces under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) that constitute the CAPFs.• Out of these seven CAPFs, four CAPFs namely Assam Rifles (AR), Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) are the Border Guarding Forces (BGFs).• Central Industrial Security Force (CISF): To provide security and consultancy to the Public Sector and Private Sector under takings and also to provide security to the VIPs.• Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) came into existence as the Crown Representative’s Police in 1939 at Neemuch (MP) to assist the princely States in maintenance of law & order.o The mission of the CRPF is to be enable the government to maintain rule of law, public order and internal security effectively.• National Security Guard (NSG) was conceptualized and created after studying and analyzing Special Force like SAS in the United Kingdom, GIGN in France.o NSG Commandos are trained in high risk tasks like counter hijacking and counter-terrorist operations.
## 4. SECURITY4.1. POLICING POWER TO CENTRAL ARMED POLICE FORCES (CAPFS)
Why in News?Recently, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)’s notification set the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) at a uniform limit of 50 Km in almost all the states that share borders with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar.More on News• Existing provisions kept the BSF’s operational area at 50 Km in Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya, but limited only to 15 Km in West Bengal, Punjab and Assam.• Similarly, in Gujarat where the existing jurisdiction was 80 Km, will now be reduced to 50 Km.• Notification will enable the BSF to search, seize and arrest to prevent offences that fall under a variety of acts including the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Passport Act, 1967. o However, jurisdiction has not been increased under the Arms Act, Customs Act and Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.• The notification, however, does not give the BSF the power to investigate crimes. Suspects and accused persons will still have to be handed over to the local authorities.Delegation of policing power to Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs)• Initial delegation of police powers to BSF was done in 1969 under the provisions of BSF Act 1968. Some modifications were notified in 1973 and 2014.• Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), which guards the Indo-Nepal border, has also been given powers of the police and other investigating agencies under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).o SSB was given permission to exercise these powers within 15 km of the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border regions, in which it operates.42 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Why was delegation of the power required?• Rising security threats: State police forces alone are unable to tackle a host of unconventional security threats and challenges that India faces (terrorism, Left-Wing Extremism (LWE), and insurgency).o Challenges are faced because of the lack of advanced equipments and arms, inadequate training of personnel and the inability of the State Governments to modernize their police forces.• Limitation of state police: There is an external dimension to the country's security scenario which limits the role of the state police forces and this necessitates the intervention of the Central Government• Policing of border areas: BSF being the only law enforcing agency present in remote border areas in Gujarat and Rajasthan required that police powers delegated to the BSF be larger in these two states.• Enhancing effectiveness: These powers enabled the forces to chase and apprehend trans-border criminals who may have managed to escape detection by BSF/SSB ambushes.• Other reasons: These powers were consideredessential in view of circumstances like the terrain, population composition, crime pattern besides presence and effectiveness of the police in border areas.Issues arising from allocation of police powers to CAPFs• Challenging Federalism: It is against federal structure as states argue that law and order is a state subject and enhancing BSF’s jurisdiction infringes upon powers of the state government.• Lack of Accountability and sensitivity to locals: National accountability mechanisms, at the level of MHA, are inherently less accessible than the regional accountability mechanisms offered by a state police force (the ability to walk into a local police station, for example). • Changed situation along borders: Population density along with police presence in border areas has gone up in last 50 years. Enhancement of jurisdiction, therefore, may lead to confusion unless close coordination with the police is not ensured.• Core function of the BSF will get adversely effected by enhancement of jurisdiction as the troops deployed on Border Out Posts (BOPs) will have to be withdrawn for operations in depth.43 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Lack of coordination with state police may lead to ugly situations because the concurrent jurisdiction of two forces, controlled by two different governments may lead to turf wars, especially if the ruling parties in the state and centre are different.• Increased human rights violation: Apprehensions are made that the increased jurisdiction of BSF, without adequate safeguards, might lead to arbitrary use of their powers and result in increased human rights violations. ConclusionA country of India’s size and importance with multiple porous and sensitive international borders in a region as volatile as South Asia needs to be cautious about its border security.But at the same time, as states in India’s federal polity are entrusted with the primary responsibility of managing the law and order within its jurisdiction, all decisions regarding the security architecture that impacts states’ domain of authority must be discussed adequately with the concerned state governments.Enhancing police capacity and facilitating grounds for greater cooperation between CAPF and state police should be initiated jointly by the Centre and states.Institutional channels of federal communication, like the Inter-State Council, should be rejuvenated for much-needed dialogue and consultation between the Centre and the States.
## 4.2. HYPERSONIC PLATFORMS
Why in news?In August, China reportedly tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicle that circled the globe before speeding towards its target. More about news• Chinese appear to have combined a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, or FOBS, with a hypersonic weapon. FOBS sends missiles through a partial orbit around the earth to strike targets from an unexpected direction.• According to the reports, weapon could, in theory, fly over the South Pole. That would pose a big challenge for the US military because its missile defence systems are focused on the northern polar route.• This test was not in isolation. China is building up his strategic forces across the board, quadrupling the size of the arsenal and building new siloed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), new mobile ICBMs, new nuclear bombers, new nuclear-armed submarines, new missile defences, and new hypersonic missiles.About Hypersonic Platforms• Hypersonic speeds are those that exceed five times the speed of sound, that is, anything that can move at speeds of Mach 5 or above, which means at least at 1.6 km per second.o Subsonic: Mach < 1.0o Transonic: Mach = 1.0o Supersonic: Mach> 1.0• Hypersonic platforms can be divided into two main categories:o Hypersonic Cruise Missiles (HCM): This is typically propelled to high speeds initially using a small rocket, and then, powered to the target by a supersonic combustion ram jet (‘scramjet’) for hypersonic flight. This is what India, under its ‘Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle’ /Mach-7 BrahMos-II program has tested.o Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGV): The HGV is a ‘boost-glide’ weapon. It is first ‘boosted’ into near-space atop a conventional rocket, and then released at an appropriate altitude and speed. The release height depends on the intended trajectory to the target. Thereafter, the HGV starts to fall back to Earth, gaining more speed and gliding along the upper atmosphere, before diving onto the target.• While the US, Russia and China possess the most advanced hypersonic weapons programmes, a number of other countries, including Australia, India, France, Germany and Japan, are also developing hypersonic weapons technology.44 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS How HCM are different from intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)? Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) Hypersonic Cruise Missiles (HCMs)• Traditional ballistic missiles and ICBMs arc along a predictable ballistic path, like a bullet, and lack the element of surprise.• Assessment by the Nuclear Threat Initiative premises that the President of the US has just 2-4 minutes to render a decision on intercepting incoming ballistic missiles fired by China/Russia and launch its own missiles against the latter.• Hypersonic missile packs the manoeuvrability of much slower subsonic cruise missiles and the hypersonic speed greater than or equal to ICBMs, making it harder to track and defend against.• The detection-interception time in case of HCMs and HGVs would be far less. Besides, HGVs do not rise above 100-110 kms altitude and HCMs fly even lower, at about 20-30 kms altitude. o Their flatter trajectories vis-à-vis ICBMs, along with the Earth’s curvature, further complicates the dynamics of detecting  intercepting.Strategic implications due to growth of Hypersonic Technology• Upsets the current military balance of power: Recent report by US-based public-policy research institute says that Russia and China have likely fielded operational hypersonic glide vehicles that are potentially armed with nuclear warheads. In contrast, most hypersonic weapons of the US are not designed for use with a nuclear warhead. • Inadvertent Escalation: Faced with hypersonic weaponsthreatandreducedwarningresponsetimings,nuclear  armedstatesarelikelytoplacetheirnuclear weapons on a hair-trigger readiness/ ‘launch on warning’ status, and/or delegate control to lower levels. Both steps hold attendant risks of inadvertent, swift escalation.o Additionally, principles for when to use hypersonic weapons have not been set and the ramifications of using them have not been thought through, raising tough questions.• Strategic instability: Hypersonic weapons, with quick-launch, high-speed, massive terminal effects capability, will encourage adventurism, make escalation control very difficult, and generate not only strategic instability but also instability in crisis management at many levels.o Unpredictable flight paths may turn to the attacker's disadvantage because uncertainty about their intended targets can lead countries that aren’t being targeted to respond by mistake.• Nuclear arms race: Demonstration of Chinese missile prowess has been considered “very close” to a Sputnik moment. Sputnik was the eponymous satellite launched in 1957 by the Soviet Union that suggested the Russians were ahead in the space raceand could one day rain nuclear bombs down on the U.S. from the sky.o The test is bound to impose new, multi-faceted, financially debilitating costs that would be in addition to conventional and nuclear weapons.o According to the latest data by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), in 2021 China had a total of 350 nuclear warheads.• Implications for India: China’s hypersonic-missile test proves that the threat from Beijing is not limited to the border areas or the Indo-Pacific. Rather China is a serious civilian and military threat to India in all areas, including the economy, space, technology, and geopolitics.How India should respond to this development?• Seize emerging interest in arms control: India should seize an emerging interest in arms control to reframe the issue from non-proliferation to non-use of nuclear weapons. Global no-first use (NFU) appear to be a reasonable and forward-looking proposal as it bequeaths restraint, or at least performs a regulative function.o India can propose a dialogue on hypersonic weapons at the Conference on Disarmament and other multilateral fora without forsaking its quest for hypersonic weapons.India’s progress towards developing hypersonic technology• BrahMos II: India has collaborated with Russia on the development of BrahMos II, a Mach 7 hypersonic cruise missile. It is scheduled to achieve initial operational capability between 2025 and 2028.• Mission Shakti: To protect its space assets, India has already proved its capabilities through the test of indigenously developed anti-satellite (ASAT) missile technology.• HSTDV: India is also developing an indigenous, dual  capable hypersonic cruise missile as part of its Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle programme (HSTDV) and successfully tested a Mach 6 scramjet in June 2019 and September 2020.• HWT test facility: An advanced Hypersonic Wind Tunnel (HWT) test facility of the DRDO was inaugurated last year in Hyderabad. It is a pressure vacuum-driven, enclosed free jet facility that simulates Mach 5 to 12.45 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • India should bepreparedforarmsrace:Armsracesareareflectionofunderlyingpoliticaldynamicandaspowercompetitionamongmajorpowersaccelerates,armsracesarelikelytobethenormandnottheexception.Thus,Indiashouldbepreparedforsucheventualities.•SpaceSituationalAwareness(SSA):Indiashouldaimtoacquireacompetitiveadvantageinthetrackingofspaceobjects,bothfromthegroundaswellasfromspace.AnindependentSSAiscrucialforspacedefenceandhasthepotentialtobecomestrategictechnologythatothercountrieswillrequire.•Investmentintechnology:WithIndia’sAIenabledAirlaunchedBallisticmissile(ALBM),Rudram3,stillintheworks,thecountryisnotpreparedtocounterChina.Hence,IndiamustmovefastandinvestheavilyinmilitarisedAItechnologiestoprotectitsinterestsatatimewhenitshostileneighbourisgrowingstrongeratanunprecedentedpace.Indiashouldfocusonpublicinvestmentinthephysics,materialsandengineeringofanti  satelliteandhypersonicsystems.ConclusionThough this test by China is so far done to build capabilities not against India but considering relations with China in recent past and unresolved border dispute, India must develop and test hypersonic capability, bolstering its strategic deterrent against China.
## 4.3. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Why in News?Recently, Government has released guidelines for the Cyber Security in Power Sector.More about news • Central Electricity Authority under the provision of Section 3(10) on Cyber Security in the ‘Central Electricity Authority (Technical Standards for Connectivity to the Grid) (Amendment) Regulations, 2019’ has framed Guideline on Cyber Security in Power Sector to be adhered by all Power Sector utilities to create cyber secure eco system.o This is the first time that a comprehensive guideline has been formulated on cyber security in power sector. • The guideline lays down actions required to ramp up security measures across various utilities to raise preparedness in power sector.• These Guideline are mandatory requirements to be met by all stakeholders and lay emphasis on: o Establishing cyber hygiene, o Training of all IT as well OT Personnel on Cyber Security, o Designating of Cyber Security Training Institutes o Cyber Testing labs in the Country • The Guideline mandates ICT based procurement from identified ‘Trusted Sources’ and identified ‘Trusted Products’ or else the product has to be tested for Malware/Hardware Trojan before deployment for use in power supply system network when system for trusted product and service is in place. • With the new norms, government aims to place mechanisms for security threat early warning, strengthen the protection and resilience of critical information infrastructure, and reduce cyber supply chain risks.o It will promote research and development in cyber security and open market for setting up Cyber Testing Infra in Public as well as Private Sector in the country.About Critical Infrastructure• Critical infrastructure (CI) refers to those essential physical and information technology facilities, networks, services and assets, which, if disrupted or destroyed, would have a serious impact on the health, safety, security, economic or social well-being or the effective functioning of government. o Chemicals, Dams, emergency services, Power & Energy, Banking & financial services, government facilities, healthcare, information technology, transportation, nuclear reactors etc. are considered parts of CI of a country.Importance of Critical infrastructure security • Resilient and secure infrastructure is vital for economic prosperity because it not only underpins the effective operating of businesses and services, but also underpins long term confidence and planning in a region, and thus ongoing investment levels.46 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • The loss, damage, unavailability, though for a short duration, can have significant consequences and cascading effects far beyond the targeted sector and physical location of the incident. o Upon computer resource, other physical systems or processes are dependent, and this computer resource, if compromised or incapacitated, would cause widespread damage, which might have severe consequences. • Disruptions to CI could impact global supply chain.Challenges in protecting critical infrastructure• Internal Resources: Many organizations including those that help to maintain Critical Infrastructure do not have enough trained security professionalsto meet their security needs.• Reluctance in Sharing Information: The inhibition in the private and public sector to share information about the vulnerability of their systems.o By revealing their vulnerabilities and their proprietary information, businesses fear exposing themselves and losing a competitive edge over rivals. As the businesses are becoming heavily dependent on IT infrastructure, there is a constant risk to the continued availability, reliability and recoverability of resources.• Clear lack of co-ordination among agencies. The interaction among Indian agencies is far too less, some of the agencies report to the Ministry of Home Affairs, while others report to the Prime Minister’s Office, Defence ministry, MeitY etc. • Capability Asymmetry: India lacks indigenization in hardware as well as software cybersecurity tools. This makes India’s cyberspace vulnerable to cyberattacks motivated by state and non-state actors. There is proposal to minimise the dependence on foreign IT products and to produce indigenous security solutions.Initiatives for critical Infrastructure protection (CIP) in India• In 2014, India established the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) to regulate and protect the nation’s Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs).o CIIs, as defined by the Information Technology Act of 2000, are vital computer resources that, if incapacitated or destroyed, will leave a debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health or safety across both public and private sectors.• Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In): National nodal agency for responding to computer security incidents.• National Cyber Security Coordinator (NCSC) under National Security Council Secretariat coordinates with different agencies at the national level for cyber security matters.• Cyber Swachhta Kendra (Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre) has been launched for detection of malicious programs and provide free tools to remove the same. • Training & Mock Drills: The government organisation have also started organising and conducting cybersecurity mock drills to assess the cybersecurity posture of organisations. 47 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Personal Data Protection Bill which aims to protect Indian users from global breaches. The bill implies the storage and processing of any critical information related to individuals only in India.Way forward• There is a dire need to evolve a comprehensive security policy to address the physical, legal, cyber and human dimensions of security. • A better understanding of vulnerabilities is required, including interdependencies between infrastructures.• CIP requires comprehensive co- operation. a functioning partnership between the state and the corporate sector is essential.• Build and grow the cyber workforce to ensure sufficient skills and talent is available. • An integrated and sustainable supply chain security objective must be included in business plans, contracts and operations.

Why in News?Recently, first part of 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was held virtually in Kunming, China.More on the News• The main objective of the COP 15 was to develop and adopt a post  2020 “Global Biodiversity Framework” with a to replace and update the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (SPB) 2011-2020 and Aichi Biodiversity Targets. • The framework will include a set of global goals, targets and indicators that will guide conservation, protection, restoration and sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystems for the next 10 years. o The first draft of the GBF was released in July 2021, containing 21 targets for 2030 and 4 Goals to achieve humanity “living in harmony with nature,” vision by 2050.• Parties will reconvene in 2022 for further negotiations and to come to a final agreement on the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.Key Outcomes of the conference• Adoption of Kunming Declaration: The declaration called for urgent and integrated action to reflect biodiversity considerations in all sectors of the global economy. o More than 100 nations, including India, made commitments to-✓ ensure the development, adoption and implementation of an effective post-2020 global biodiversity framework. ✓ reverse the current loss of biodiversity.✓ ensure that biodiversity is put on a path to recovery by 2030 at the latest.o It also noted the efforts and commitment of many countries to protect 30 percent of their land and sea areas by 2030 (30 by 30 target), which is critical for reversing a major driver of nature’s decline.49 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Kunming Biodiversity Fund: China established the Fund with approximately USD 230 million to support projects for protecting biodiversity in developing countries.• Open letter to Private sector: The conference called for increased involvement of the private sector, including an open letter from business CEOs to world leaders, urging for bold action.• Global Environment Facility, the UN Development Programme and the UN Environment Programme, committed to fast-tracking financial and technical support to developing countries for GBF implementation.Key issues related to post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework• Adoption of the 30 by 30 Targets: Related issues--o Could harm the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities living in biodiverse regions.o Difficulties in multilateral cooperation for conservation of cross border land/ocean areas.o Lack of quality targets will result in the protection of areas of little conservation value.• Digital sequence information (DSI): Presently commercial benefits of DSI are not covered by benefit-sharing mechanisms. Countries rich in genetic resources but lacking the capacity to utilise them want DSI to be covered by benefit-sharing mechanisms – a move opposed by countries strong in biotech. o DSI is information that has been obtained from sequencing and analysing genetic material.• Lack of ambition and urgency: For example, while the world has been shocked by the scientific conclusion that more than a million species are threatened with extinction, the draft framework fails to set a goal or target of halting extinctions directly caused by human activity.• Financing gap: Current financial mechanisms fall short of estimated USD 700 billion needed annually to halt biodiversity decline.• Lack of convenient mechanisms to track collective ambitions, or to regularly take stock of progress: This has led to worsening of drivers of biodiversity loss and decline in biodiversity between 2011 and 2020 despite an increase in policies and actions to support biodiversity.o According to the findings of Fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5) report, at the global level none of the 20 targets have been fully achieved.• Fragmented efforts: There is a need for integrated efforts to address crises of biodiversity loss, climate change, land degradation and desertification, ocean degradation, and pollution as they share many underlying drivers of change. • Adverse impact on small farmers: Redirecting agricultural, forestry and fishing subsidies which harm biodiversity will adversely impact small-scale farmers, fishers etc. in developing nations.• Negative impact of emphasizing carbon storage functions of Nature based Solutions: It can lead to carbon emitters using tree-planting and other carbon offsets in developing countries to avoid their duties to cut emissions, while expropriating the forest usage rights of indigenous people and local residents.Way Forward• Protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures should be expanded to incorporate all areas of particular importance for biodiversity, including key biodiversity areas (KBAs), while recognising the rights and roles of indigenous peoples and local communities.50 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Global targets must be measurable, underpinned by science, and have explicit outcomes, so that their implementation and impacts can be monitored and assessed.o Clear systems of common indicators, monitoring, reporting and review, and global stocktaking of progress and ratcheting of ambitions are needed.• Given the links between the climate and nature crises, targets within the framework should be aligned to existing commitments related to climate, land sea etc. • Governments should make efforts to raise and contribute additional investment in nature.o At least 10% of the overall recovery investment for COVID-19 crisis can be directed towards protecting and restoring nature.• Measures for successful implementation require capacity building, technology transfer, technical support,South  Southandotherformsofcooperation, gender mainstreaming, incorporation of traditional and local knowledge, public awareness and participation, and transparency.Related News: High Ambition Coalition (HAC) for Nature and People• India officially joined the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People.• India is the first of the BRICS bloc of major emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) to join the HAC.• It is an intergovernmental group of 70 countries co-chaired by Costa Rica and France and by the United Kingdom as Ocean co-chair, championing a global deal for nature and people with the central goal of protecting at least 30 percent of world’s land and ocean by 2030. • The 30x30 target is a global target which aims to halt the accelerating loss of species, and protect vital ecosystems that are the source of our economic security.
## 5.2. INDIA AND CLIMATE AGENDA
Why in News?Prime Minister of India recently laid out India’s climate change action plan (panchamrita) at the ongoing 26th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow.Prevalent challenges related to India’s Climate action
• Coal dependency: Coal continues to be a driving force behind electrification in India and plays an important role in the energy security of the country. Thus, it will be difficult to replace it, especially since integrating renewable energy into the grid can be costly.
• Further, multiple coal-fired power plants already in the works are still being built and approvals are being given for new domestic mines to be opened up.
• Balancing growth and environment: For a country like India, committing to net zero transition could potentially have implications on growth, on the economy and on energy availability for industrialisation and urbanisation.
• Lack of ambition:o Scientists have advised countries to go net zero latest by 2050 and move on to negative emissions to mitigate the worst effects of the climate crisis.o Also, India’s commitments focus on increasing total capacity rather than total consumption of renewable installed capacity o Absence of commitments relating to reduction in emissions from other energy-intensive sectors like transport sector and industries like cement, iron and steel, non-metallic minerals and chemicals.51 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
• Rising emissions from agricultural sector: India's significant food and fertilizer subsidies contribute to climate change leading to high GHG emissions, especially in paddy cultivation.• Need of investment: India expects developed countries to provide climate finance of $1 trillion.
• Issues in implementation of the climate missions: like institutional, systemic and process barriers, includingfinancial constraints, inter-ministerial coordination, lack of technical expertise and project clearance delays.
• Existing laws are inadequate to deal with climate change: and do not contain provisions to specifically to reduce future climate impacts and tackle environmental/climate violations.
• Fragmentation of climate action: India lacks a comprehensive climate action plan to monitor and deal with climate adaptation and mitigation and other environmental and socio-economic issues in an integrated manner. Way Forward• Phasing out coal by retiring the inefficient coal plants and not building new ones.
• Enacting a climate law: It could consider two aspects: o Creating an institution that monitors action plans for climate change: A ‘Commission on Climate Change’ with quasi-judicial powers could be set up, with the power and the authority to issue directions, and oversee implementation of plans and programmes on climate. o Establishing a system of liability and accountability at short-, medium- and long-term levels by having a legally enforceable National Climate Change Plan that goes beyond just policy guidelines.
• Developing a strategy for net zero goals (see infographic):
• Ensuring adequate support from developed to developing countries in the form of finance, technology and in capacity building.• Net negative emissions from developed nations: In order to vacate the carbon space in 2050 for developing countries to grow, the developed countries can aim for negative emissions.Schemes/policies to combat Climate Change• National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).
• Climate Change Action Program (CCAP). • National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP), 2020 which includes Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme.
• Adoption of the BS-VI norms to reduce vehicular emissions.52 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.• Energy Conservation Building Code.
• Schemes to promote renewable energy: Solar cities, Ultra mega solar parks, National Biofuel Policy, National Offshore Wind Energy Policy, Renewable Purchase Obligation etc.• Other schemes: Ujjwala, UJALA, AMRUT, Swachh Bharat Mission, Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) etc.• Financial tools: National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change, Priority Sector Lending (PSL) for renewable energy sector. 
• Satellite technology to observe and tackle Climate Change- HySIS Megha-Tropiques SARAL mission, Oceansat3-Argos mission etc.• At International stage: International Solar Alliances (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).• Other measures: Polluter Pay Principle, Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, Carbon tax, Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts).Related News Production gap report 2021 released by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)• Report measures the gap between governments’ planned production of fossil fuels and the global production levels consistent with meeting the Paris Agreement temperature limits (limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C).• Key Findingso As countries set net-zero emission targets, and increase their climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement, they have not explicitly recognized or planned for the rapid reduction in fossil fuel production that these targets will require.o World’s governments plan to produce around 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 45% more than consistent with 2°C.o G20 countries have directed over USD 300 billion in new funds towards fossil fuel activities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic —more than they have towards clean energy.• Key recommendationso Acknowledge in their energy and climate plans need to reduce global fossil fuel production in line with Paris Agreement’s limits.o Place restrictions on fossil fuel exploration and extraction and phase out government support for fossil fuel production.o Leverage international cooperation to ensure a more effective and equitable global wind-down of production.
## 5.3. RIGHT TO BURN FOSSIL FUELS
Why in news?The Like-Minded Developing Countries — a group of developing countries which have a similar stand in the United Nations climate negotiations — has demanded that Developed countries must ensure net-zero emissions by 2030 to provide carbon space to the developing countries to burn fossil fuels like coal for their growth.Why does India need a ‘right to burn’ fossil fuels?• Low share in global emissions: India has neither historically emitted nor currently emits carbon anywhere close to what the global North has, or does, in per capita terms. Thus, it has no reason to commit to declining dependence on coal, at least in the near future.o India’s emissions are at relatively low 1.96 tons CO2 per capita (17.6 tons CO2 per capita for USA)

• Fulfilment of India's developmental imperatives like eradication of poverty, provision of basic needs for all citizens and access to energy for all, in the context of sustainable development need space for emissions.53 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Definition of Forest: T N Godavarman case

• Till 1996 concerned authorities used to apply the provisions of the Act only to the forests notified under the Indian Forest Act, 1927.

• However, following a Supreme Court judgment in T N Godavarman case, the definition of “forest” was expanded to include:o All areas recorded as “forest” in any government (Union and State) record, irrespective of ownership, recognition and classification.o All areas that conformed to the “dictionary” meaning of “forest.o Areas which are identified as “forest” by an expert committee constituted by the Supreme Court following the 1996 order.

• Thus, forest lands in India include unclassified forests, undemarcated forests, existing or deemed forests, protected forests, reserved forests, sanctuaries and national parks etc

• Technological and financial advancement: Developed countries have technological and financial capacity to fulfil early targets and leave the remaining atmospheric space for the developmental rights of the developing world.What are the issues in giving such a ‘right’?

• Urgent need to mitigate for climate impacts: India faces harmful impacts related to sea level rise, heat stress, drought, water stress and flooding, biodiversity and natural disasters.

• Coal is no longer reliable and cost effective: India is among the largest importers of coal in the world, and volatility in global prices threatens its energy security.o Recent data show that the levelized cost of electricity from renewable energy sources like solar (photovoltaic), hydro and onshore wind has been declining sharply over the last decade and is already less than fossil fuel  based electricity generation.

• High future emissions: India’s contribution to future emissions is considerably greater, as its population is projected to continue to grow and surpass China’s around 2025.

• Injustice is not at the level of the nation-states alone: Developing countries need to address the injustice between the rich and the poor within nations and between humans and non-human species. Poor in India will unduly bear the effect of climate change because of its tropical climate and high population density along the coastal lines

• Green transition can increase inclusion and growth: Investment in sectors such as renewable energy, electric mobility etc. has the potential to address the issues of employment, technology, energy poverty and self-reliance.o For instance, solar rooftops can provide decentralised access to clean energy to the poor and the marginalised, including in remote regions of India. Way Forward

• Focus of the discussion on climate finance for developing countries should be on providing adequate resources —both financial and technology transfer to facilitate the developing countries to transition to a low carbon growth pathway.

• South-South collaborations can help developing countries like India to advance technologically and financially towards a greener economy.
## 5.4. AMENDMENTS IN FOREST CONSERVATION ACT
Why in News?Recently, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued a letter and consultation paper that documented proposed changes to the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 (FCA).About Forest Conservation Act, 1980• The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, came into force to provide for the conservation of forests in India.• The Act prohibits state and other authorities, except with the prior approval of the Central Government, to give any order directing:o de-reservation of forest; o use of forest land for non-forest purpose;o assigning any forest land or its portion by way of lease to any private person or organization;o Clearing of trees which have grown naturally in forested land.• Any diversion of land for non-forest purpose requires approval under the Act as well as payment of stipulated compensatory levies such as Net Present Value (NPV), Compensatory Afforestation (CA), etc.54 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Power to make rules: The Act empowers Central Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of this Act.• Definition of Non-forest purpose: It means the breaking up or clearing of any forest land for the cultivation of tea, coffee, spices, medicinal plants, etc. and for any purpose other than reforestation.o Non-forest purposes don't include work relating or ancillary to conservation, development and management of forests and wildlife like establishment of check-posts, fire lines, wireless communications and construction of fencing, etc.• Constitution of Advisory Committee: The Central Government may constitute a Committee consisting to advise that Government for the grant of approval and any other matter connected with the conservation of forests.• Penalties: Contravention of any of the provisions of the Act is punishable imprisonment of upto fifteen days.• Offences by the Authorities and Government Departments are punishable as well.• Appeal: Any person aggrieved may file an appeal to the National Green Tribunal.Proposed Amendment in Forest Conservation Act 1980Need for amendment in the Present Act Proposed AmendmentsScope of the Act• Presently, identification of forest land is subjective and arbitrary to some extent. For instance, it includes lands bearing vegetation irrespective of ownership and classification even if they are considered forest based on some locally defined criteria.• To define ‘forests’ in an objective manner.Land Acquired before 1980• The unused land with vegetation acquired by various ministries, including Ministry of Road, Railway, Defense etc., before 1980 for construction/expansion purposes are protected under the Act.• Exempt such lands acquired before 25.10.1980 from the purview of the Act.Differences in land records of forests• There are several contrasting entries of the same land in revenue records and in the forest records, such as in case of plantations. This has created a scope of mis-interpretation and litigation. • Revenue records to be statutorily required to reflect the occupier and the nature of land including forest.• Lands identified as plantation, afforestation etc. after 12.12.1996 to remain outside the purview of the Act to encourage forestry activities.Construction alongside road and railways• Alongside roads and railway lines, strip plantations have been developed and notified as forests which creates approval issues for construction of amenities and facilities.• Exemption up to 0.05 ha for each such accesses may be allowed to alleviate the hardship of the residents/business owners.Conservation of Pristine Land• There are no prohibitory (only regulatory) provisions in the Act for non-forestry use of pristine forest.• Introducing an enabling provision in the Act to keep certain pristine forests showcasing rich ecological values intact for a specific period.Development of infrastructure along the international border areas• Obtaining approval from central government for projects of national importance is difficult leading to delay in these projects.• Such projects to be exempted from obtaining prior approval of Central Government • To allow the states to permit non-forest use of such lands.Misuse of provisions by mining companies • Forest land can be diverted under two provisions  o 2(ii) For use of forest land for non-forestry purpose by paying only NPV.o 2(iii) For assignment of lease which requires detailed examination of the proposal and payment of other compensatory levies such as CA in addition to NPV.• However, mining leaseholder misuse provision 2(ii) and get away with paying the NPV money only.• Delete 2(iii) of the Act and clarify that 2 (ii) can be invoked for any kind of lease assignment having an intention of using for non-forestry purpose.55 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS New drilling technologies• New environmentally friendly technologies which enables exploration or extraction of oil & natural gas deep beneath without impacting the forest soil or aquifer are coming up.• Such environmentally friendly technologies to be kept outside the purview of Act.Private land covered under definition of forests• Presently, current definition of forest, as updated under the T N Godavarman case, includes private areas which restrict the right of an individual to use his/her own land for any non forestry activity.• Allow owners of such lands for construction of structures and residential unit up to an area of 250 sq mtr as one time relaxation.Activities related to conservation of forests and wildlife• Currently activities like establishment of zoos, safaris, Forest Training infrastructures etc. are not excluded from definition non-forestry purposes.• Such activities to be excluded from "non  forestry activity" as activities which are ancillary to conservation of forests and wildlife.Imposition of compensatory levies• Currently, the compensatory levies are imposed at the time of assignment as well as renewal of lease of land.• Double imposition of any levy should be removed. Penal Provisions• Present penal provisions are not sufficient to deter violation of the act.• Offences to be made cognizable, non-bailable and punishable with imprisonment of upto one year.• In case any authority in the State Government or Union territory Administration is involved the compensation shall be deposited in the National CAMPA rather than in State CAMPA.Concerns regarding amendments• Concerns regarding redefining forest land: Dilution of definition of forests may lead to exclusion and degradation of certain forested areas.• Impact on protection rights provided under Forest Rights Act, 2006: Proposal to exempt plantations and other such lands in revenue records marked as forests after 1996 from the purview of FCA, can allow change in land use at will. o This can take such lands out of the purview of the Gram Sabha and affect the legal rights of Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs).• Building of Biodiversity threatening infrastructure: Roads and railway lines can accelerate deforestation and create permanent barriers, leading to destruction of wildlife habitat and obstruction free movement of wild animals. o Example: Arboreal mammals move through the tree canopy are severely impacted.o Also, adopting new methods of Extended Reach Drilling may seriously impact the balance of the biosphere• Pressure from Ecotourism: Use of forest land for non-permanent structures for eco-tourism would disturb forest areas.• Unknown nature of plantation: While the amendments emphasize on creation of an enabling regulatory environment for setting up plantations, to enhance carbon sink, it does not define what the nature of these plantations should be and where they can take place. o Monoculture plantation projects can turn out to be ecologically destructive as they destroy biodiversity by replacing multifunctional forests and vegetations. • Lack of consultation with forest-dwelling communities, whose livelihoods and rights are likely to be affected by the amendments.• Infringement on right of states: The amendments propose changes in recording of land revenue. However, land revenue is categorically a State subject in Schedule VII of the Constitution.ConclusionThe Act in its current form has created several hurdles in the way of development. Yet, any change in this act can only work if it recognizes the ‘symbiotic relationships’ between the forest, the stakeholders and the biodiversity. Therefore, better engagement with stakeholders is required while keeping biodiversity at the center is must.56 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS
## 5.5. DRAFT NATIONAL WATER POLICY
Why in news?After three national water policies--1987, 2002 and 2012--India has prepared a new national policy on water, key to addressing problems with water quality and ensuring water security for all.More on news• The water expert Mihir Shah, chairperson of the 13-member committee that has drafted the NWP and has asked it to be implemented by 2030 to solve the water crisis of the country.Need for a water policySpecification DescriptionCompetitive extraction of ground water• India is the largest extractor of groundwater in the world. Nearly 600 million Indians face high to extreme water stress, which is set to worsen with the average annual per capita water availability estimated to fall by 37% over half a century to 2050, potentially making India water scarce.• The vital ecosystem services provided by groundwater have also been endangered. The most striking manifestation of this is the drying up of rivers such as Gomti, Chambal, Ken, which depend on groundwater flows during the post-monsoon period.Urbanisation • Rapid urbanisation is leading to more informal sourcing of water, mainly through tankers using groundwater, increasing demands for long-distance import of water. This not only increases the cost of supply but also wastage of water due to leakage.• Indian cities also had a large number of water bodies. They acted as sponges for excess water and their natural drainages provided a safe exit for flood-waters. But over time they have been encroached upon destroying the vital role they have played in natural flood management. These are one of the prime reasons for frequent floods and flash floods in Indian cities. WASH • Only 47% of urban households have individual water connections. • Urban areas produce 62,000 million litres of sewage every day. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the installed capacity to treat this sewage is only 37% and just 30% is actually treated. Some of these plants do not function, either because of high recurring costs, or because they do not have enough sewage to treat.Reforming water governance• Doing away with "command-and-control" approach: In this type of approach the rules and regulations within the policies are framed by the government agencies without giving due consideration to the region-specific, socio-economic, political, geographic and institutional factors. Such ‘one-shoe-fits all’policies may not reflect the preferences of the farmers and other stakeholders• Doing away with “hydro-schizophrenia”: At present Governance of water suffers from three kinds of “hydro-schizophrenia”: That between irrigation and drinking water, surface and groundwater, as also water and wastewater. Government departments, working in silos, have generally dealt with just one side of these binaries.Key recommendations of the draft NWP• Shift towards demand managemento Crop diversification: Irrigation consumes 80-90 per cent of India’s water, most of which is used by rice, wheat and sugarcane. Hence, there is a need to diversifying public procurement operations to include nutri-cereals, pulses and oilseeds. The largest outlets for these procured crops could be the Integrated Child Development Services, the mid-day meal scheme and the public distribution system. This would incentivise farmers to diversify their cropping patterns, resulting in huge savings of water. o Reduce-Recycle-Reuse: It has been proposed for integrated urban water supply and wastewater management, with treatment of sewage and eco-restoration of urban river stretches, as far as possible through decentralised wastewater management. All non-potable use, such as flushing, fire protection, vehicle washing must mandatorily shift to treated wastewater.• Supply-side managemento Deploy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system: Trillions of litres stored in big dams, which are still not reaching farmers. Irrigated area could be greatly expanded at very low cost by deploying pressurised closed conveyance pipelines, combined with SCADA systems and pressurised micro-irrigation.57 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development, 1992• In 1992 the International Conference on Water and the Environment was held in Dublin, Ireland.• The output from this conference was a declaration regarding water that was presented to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) that was held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 also known as the “Earth Summit”.• The inclusion of the Dublin Principles in the conference debate helped to highlight the importance of water as a resource for environmental protection and human development. • The Dublin Principles remain the standard for consideration of the issues surrounding water resource use and protection.o “Nature-based solutions”: These include incentivizing rejuvenation of catchment areas through compensation for eco-system services. Specially curated “blue-green infrastructure” such as rain gardens and bio-swales, restored rivers with wet meadows, wetlands constructed for bio-remediation, urban parks, permeable pavements, green roofs, etc. are proposed for urban areas.o Sustainable and equitable management of groundwater: Participatory groundwater management is the key. Information on aquifer boundaries, water storage capacities and flows provided in a user-friendly manner to stakeholders, designated as custodians of their aquifers, would enable them to develop protocols for effective management of groundwater.o Prior & primary importancetoriverprotectionandrevitalization:Stepstorestoreriverflowsinclude:Re  vegetationofcatchments,regulationofgroundwater extraction, river-bed pumping and mining of sand and boulders. The NWP outlines a process to draft a Rights of Rivers Act, including their right to flow, to meander and to meet the sea.• Water quality: It proposes that every water ministry, at the Centre and states, include a water quality department. It suggests a task force on emerging water contaminants to better understand and tackle the threats they are likely to pose. The policy advocates adoption of state-of-the-art, low-cost, low-energy, eco-sensitive technologies for sewage treatment.o Widespread use of reverse osmosis (RO) has led to huge water wastage and adverse impact on water quality. The policy wants RO units to be discouraged if the total dissolved solids count in water is less than 500mg/L. • Reforming governance of water: The policy suggests creation of a unified multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder National Water Commission (NWC), which would become an exemplar for states to follow. Government waterdepartments include professionals predominantly from civil engineering, hydrology and hydrogeology. o governments should build enduring partnerships with primary stakeholders of water, who must become an integral part of the NWC and its counterparts in the states. The indigenous knowledge of our people, with a long history of water management, is an invaluable intellectual resource that must be fully leveraged.• Dedicated task group for effective implementation: The proposed task group will oversee and coordinate the implementation, monitoring and assessment of progress on the policy. The task group will also develop a 10-year action plan with the active involvement of stakeholders at all levels, within one year of its setting up.
## 5.6. WATER COMMODIFICATION
Why in news?Recently, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for the United Nations (UN) informed the UN General Assembly (UNGA) that Water is not a commodity and financial asset to be exploited.About water commodification• “Commodification” of water refers to water handled as a commodity under supply and demand market dynamics as a way of setting the price of market transactions between users. o In December 2020, for the first time in history, a tradable water price futures index was launched on the Chicago Stock Exchange on the Nasdaq Veles California Water Index (NQH2O). Nasdaq developed the NQH2O Index in partnership with Veles Water Limited.• It is mentioned in the fourth principle of the Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development of 1992 (refer infographic) that water should be recognized as an economic good – an approach that serves as a basis for its consideration as a financial asset, as has been done with economic goods in general, within the dynamics of the financialization of the economy.58 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Characteristics of water trading markets o Separation of water from land to allow water commodification; o Deregulation of water rights tradingbetween users and between different uses; o Transition from publicly regulated pricing, usually for non-profit cost recovery, to market water pricing;o Increasing de facto private appropriation of water, marginalization of vulnerable users and disregard for affected third parties and non-productive values; • Issues associated with commodifying watero Ascertaining water as a commodity and putting into competitive space shall result in discriminatory practices making survival of the less-privileged difficult in a country that fundamentally guarantees social and economic equality.o Whereas California’s water market is adequately represented by the stakeholders involved – from investors, farmers, banks and other beneficiaries, India lacks clear and transparent pricing regulations.o Trading of water use rights in markets has erodes the notion of water as a common good and the State as a guarantor of the general interest.
• Potential benefits: The risk transfer in the private sector could significantly reduce the burden of drought relief, currently borne by banks and governments.o There is a need for promoting reforms that allow the purchase and sale of water concession rights, with the aim of making the concession system more flexible to better manage scarcity.• While no particular provision in the Indian Constitution categorically recognises water as a positive human right, the judiciary has interpreted right to water as a fundamental right, a facet of right to life and dignity under the ambit of Article 21.Way ahead• Efficient regulations needed: Baseline for calculating water available for water futures should be set only after fulfilling the domestic supply of water – as demonstrated and adopted by our Chinese counterparts conceptualising the ‘China Water Exchange’.• Managing scarcity through democratic water governanceo States should manage water as a public good, ensure sustainable management, and develop participatory climate change adaptation plans, in order to guarantee the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation.o States should re-think the usefulness of water trading as a tool for managing scarcity, and to consult the public to determine whether water trading markets should be abolished or more strictly regulated.o States should urgently take legal measures to prevent water from being subject to financial speculation in futures markets, potentially causing far-reaching consequences similar to those of the food and housing bubbles. • Strategies to cope with climate change-related scarcity risks o Design and promote hydrological, territorial and urban planning in order to strengthen environmental and social resilience in the face of drought;o Restore aquatic ecosystems to a healthy state; 59 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS o Put an end to the excessive exploitation of aquifers and enable them to be used as strategic natural reserves that will allow future droughts to be managed; o Promote public consultation processes to build the basis for adapting the concession rights to the new realities imposed by climate change; o Develop modular strategies to produce quality water in a flexible way, adapted to drought cycles; o Strengthen the concession system by way of transparent public institutions (e.g., water banks) to negotiate the recovery of water rights with fair compensation and reallocate them during periods of drought, under adequate social and environmental regulations;o Effectively prioritize the human rights to water and sanitation in these difficult circumstances, especially for those living in the greatest vulnerability.
## 5.7. STUBBLE BURNING
Why in News?The Air Quality of the NCR region once again became severe due to increased instances of stubble burning and other factors responsible for its air pollution in the month of October/November.More on News• One of the main reasons behind air pollution, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi Pollution reached 36% (PM2.5) for 2021, in comparison to 42% in 2020 and 44% in 2019.• Overall, the instances of stubble burning reduced significantly (close to 50%) this year (between 01 September and 02 November), as suggested by data from Commission for Air Quality Management or CAQM. • Overall, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi varied from very poor to severe as compared to the moderate/poor air quality of cities like Mumbai,Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata (on SAFAR-AQI, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research.)About Stubble Burning• How was it introduced? o Started mainly after mechanized harvesting, the practice of Stubble Burning, i.e., burning of the paddy crop residue as part of post-harvest exercise to clear fields, has become an annual affair in Northern India.• Why paddy crop is the primary contributor to stubble burning?o Though practiced for other crops as well like sugarcane and wheat, it is a major concern for rice due to its high proportion of agro-waste (around 70%). E.g., out of an estimated 586 million tonnes (mt) of stubble generated in India every year, 34% is contributed by Rice and 22% by Wheat.60 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • What are the major stubble producing areas? o Rice cultivation in northern India, i.e., states of Punjab, Haryana, parts of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, are the hotspots for stubble generation and thus burning.o E.g., In 2020, the total quantity of straw generated by Haryana, Punjab and U.P. was 28.4 mt. For 2021, it is expected to be around 26.21 mt due to reduced area of cultivation.Initiatives to reduce Stubble BurningArea InitiativesAdministrative • National Policy for Management of Crop Residues (2014) for crop residues management, to be adopted by states.• Set up of biomass power projects and mandating the use of biomass with 50% paddy straw as a supplement fuel by coal plants in NCR.• Set up of the CAQM for better coordination and solution to pollution problem in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas.• Crop diversification and promotion of short duration High Yielding varieties of rice to reduce the use of PUSA-44 variety of paddy (one of the prime crops behind concern over paddy straw burning).• Capacity building and Awareness initiatives on ill effects of Stubble Burning.Legal • In 2015, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned crop residue burning in the states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab.• Burning crop residue is made a crime under Section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) and under the Air and Pollution Control Act of 1981.• Imposition of Penalties/fines on stubble burning by state governments.Technological Interventions• Use of machines like Happy Seeder, Rotavators, Balers, Paddy Straw Chopper, Reaper Binder etc. to plant new crops or clear the stubble.• Use of Bio-Decomposer technology developed by IARI to dissolve the collected straw and turn it into manure.• Promotion of alternative uses of stubble instead of burning such as its use in cattle feed, compost manure, roofing in rural areas, mushroom cultivation, packing materials, fuel, paper, bio-ethanol and industrial production, etc.Financial Incentives• Government Subsidy on use of machinery for in-situ management of crop residue.• Bonus/Incentive to farmers who switch to other crops instead of rice by state governments. E.g. Rs 7,000 per acre by Haryana Government under Kheti Khaali, Fir Bhi Khushali.What have been the issues in implementation of these initiatives? • The Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act, 2009: Though introduced to prevent groundwater crisis in summer, the law shifted sowing and transplanting of paddy in Punjab from April and May to May and June respectively. It shifted the timing of stubble burning in Punjab as well to the time of onset of winter in Northern India creating an undesirable intersection.• Mixed success of Technological Interventions: Due to time and Cost considerations, the success of technological interventions is mixed. The subsidy from the government is often delayed with lack of connectivity with alternative use industries.• Limitations of Bio-Decomposer: In rainy periods, the spraying of bio-decomposer gets delayed due to wet or submerged fields.61 www.visionias.in©VisionIAS•AdministrativeChallenges:WithAgriculturebeingasensitiveissueandlargenumberofsmallandmarginalfarmers,theimplementationofthepolluterpaysprincipleisachallenge.•PoliticalChallenges:Duetopoliticalblamegame,thegovernmentoftenlacksstrengthtoimposefinesdespiteSupremeCourtorderstoendStubbleBurning.•BehavioralChallenge:Duetolackofcomprehensiononoverallilleffects,comparisonwithotherpollutantsoreaseofburningstubble,manyfarmerslackthewilltomovetowardsothermethodsforstubblemanagement.•PoorMSPsupportforothercrops:Adoptionofalternativecropsbyfarmersrequiresprocurementsupportwhichislargelylimitedtofewcropslikericeandwheat.WhatcanbedonetoovercometheseconstraintsandresolvetheissueWithincreasedfocusonglobalwarmingandenvironmentalpollutionduetoourincreasedawarenessonillsofsuchactivitiesonhealthandenvironment,Indianeedstoendstubbleburningthrough•SetupofRiceBioparks(suggestedbyM.S.Swaminathanaspartofdoecologyapproach)tohelpfarmerstoconvertricestubbleintoincomeandemployment.•Improveoverallinfrastructureintermsofavailabilityofmachinesandcustomhiringcentres(CHCs)networkformachinerybyusingfarmcooperatives.•SetupanefficientlogisticsystemforcollectionandtransportofpaddystrawtoalternativeuseindustriesforEx  situcropresiduemanagement.•EffectivemonitoringofstubbleburningwithenforcementofPolluterPaysprinciple,utilizingdronesandISROcapabilitiesforrecordingandmonitoringofstubbleburning,and•Handholdthesmallandmarginalfarmerstoprovidebasicamenitieswhicharenecessarytoraiseawarenessonillsofstubbleburningandthealternativeusesofstubble.5.8.WASTETOWEALTHWhyinNewsToenablecollaborationsforsustainabledevelopmentthroughacirculareconomyandcommunityparticipation,thegovernmentlaunchedtheWastetoWealthportalonGandhiJayanti.MoreonNews•OneamongninemissionsundertheofficeofthePrincipalScientificAdviser,theWastetoWealthportalwillbringtogethertechnologyproviders,governmentstakeholdersandurbanlocalbodies.•PartofSwachhBharatUnnatBharatAbhiyan(SBUB),itwillfocusonscientificprocessingofwastetobuildazerolandfillandzerowastenationtoachieveobjectivesof  oIdentifyingandsupportingthedevelopmentofnewtechnologiesforcleanerandgreenerenvironment,o Boost and augment the Swachh Bharat Mission and Smart Cities Project,o Create financially viable Circular Economy models for waste management, ando Streamline waste handling in India.Solid Waste and its Management in India• Meaning: Solid or semi-solid domestic waste, sanitary waste, commercial waste, institutional waste, catering and market waste and other non-residential wastes, street sweepings, silt removed or collected from the surface drains, horticulture waste, agriculture and dairy waste, treated bio  medical waste excluding industrial waste, bio-medical waste and e-waste, battery waste, radio-active waste etc. (Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016).62 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Concern on Solid Waste: An inevitable by-product of human activities, most of it is recyclable naturally. It becomes a concern when the waste generation rate becomes higher than recycling.○ Humans can minimize/eliminate the concern through effective waste management, but it requires harmony between Quantity of generation, collection and treatment.• Generation in India: Presently, India generates an estimated 62 million tonnes (mt) of annual waste, including nearly 5.6 mt of plastic waste, 7.90 mt of hazardous waste, 1.5 mt of e-waste and 0.17 mt of biomedical waste.• Management in India: Around 70% waste is collected and 20% recycled while most of it is either dumped at landfill sites (around 31mt), in water bodies or piled up in open areas. E.g.○ The five major metropolitan cities alone, i.e., Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata generate over 10 million tonnes of waste; leading to formation of garbage mountains like Deonar in Mumbai and Ghazipur in Delhi.About Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016• Divided into IV Schedules, it was brought to ensure effective implementation of the Rules and achieve objectives of the Swachh Bharat• It removed Municipal from Solid waste to cover areas beyond Municipal Area such as outgrowths in urban agglomerations, notified areas, defence establishments etc.• It doesn’t cover plastic, e-waste, biomedical, hazardous and construction and demolition waste, as they are covered under separate rulesSalient Features of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016• Identifies waste generators, starting from each household and includes event organizers, street vendors, Hotels and restaurants, etc.• Fixing of Duties, starting from waste generators to authorities such as District Magistrate, Ministries etc. E.g. the Ministry of Urban Development (now MoHUA) will frame National Policy on SWM and coordinate with States/UTs, provide technical guidelines, financial support, training to local bodies• Set up Central Monitoring Committee by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to monitor and review its implementation annually.• Revised Parameters and Standards, starting from landfills to emission and compost standards. E.g., Landfill site shall be 100 metres away from a river, 200 metres from a pond, 500, 200 metres away from highways, habitations, public parks and water supply wells and 20 km away from airports/airbase.• Manufacturers to provide a pouch or wrapper for disposal of sanitary waste like diapers and sanitary pads; • Waste to Energy plant for waste with 1500 Kcal/kg and above for co-incineration in cement and power plants, etc.How ‘waste’ presents an economic opportunity for India? • Generate Energy: Solid waste when taken through right processes can be relooked as potential fuel. Following techniques can be used to realize this  o Gasification of thewaste:Thegeneratedwastecanbeconvertedintogasbasedenergyplantsthroughtechnologies such as biogas plants. o Pelletization: Pelletized sludge can act as efficient sources of energy production and when created in appropriate sizes, they can also be used as rich source of fertilizer for plants. o Reprocessing as irrigation waste: Partially treating the wastewater is economically cost-efficient and can be safely used for non-consumption purposes like cooling or irrigation. • Recycle materials: Recycling materials at the segregation stage itself could present a significant economic opportunity. For instance, some estimates suggest that a circular economy path adopted by India could bring in annual benefits of 40 lakh crores or approximately US$ 624 billion in 2050.• Extract resources of value: Processing of waste especially E-waste could enable extraction of precious metals such as copper, gold, aluminum etc. in economically significant amounts. For example, in India, the e-waste industry is estimated to be worth about USD 3 billion annually. Creation of these economic activities and industries indirectly encourages entrepreneurship and job creation across the complete economic chain. What are the challenges in realizing these opportunities? • Multiple Sources of Waste Generation: The solid waste is generated from items used daily, including appliances, product packaging, food scraps, newspapers etc. with widespread sources like residential areas, schools, hospitals, restaurants etc., making segregation and processing a challenge. 63 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Toxic Wastes: Most of these waste materials contain toxic substances which require proper handling and treatment to minimize the harmful impacts.• Limited capabilities of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs): ULBs such as Municipalities lack monetary resources, manpower and expertise to handle even existing solid waste while tapping waste opportunities involve costly and complex operations.• Private Participation: Due to limited business opportunities at waste treatment with lack of backward linkage with generation sources, the private sector participation has remained poor.• Education and Behavioral Issues: The lack of awareness among people on waste categories and behavioral issues such as throwing of garbage in the open or burning instead of giving it to municipal bodies (also due to charges of it).What can be done to realize the potential of ‘waste to wealth’? • Building the base: Efforts could be made to encourage and ensure segregation at source and 100% waste collection. This will act as a base of processors and entrepreneurs with the available and processable raw material. • Institutional support to waste processing: Institutional support in the waste processing rules, dedicated schemes or subsidies could go a long way in encouraging private sector participants to embrace the growing waste processing sector. • Conducive business environment: Ensuring credit availability, streamlined regulatory framework and the complete network of connected economic activities would be a necessity for the growth of the sector. • Creating Infrastructure: From solid waste management plants to construction and demolition waste collection sites, infrastructure would be needed to ensure that the waste processing activity takes root. o Prevalence of infrastructure will provide forward and backward linkages to the private sector and the sources of waste respectively. • Building awareness among citizens: Citizens as primary operators of their waste and the consumers of the processed material need to have an awareness about importance of waste processing. This will help them make environmentally conscious choices.
## 5.9. WORLD HERITAGE FORESTS: CARBON SINKS UNDER PRESSURE
Why in News?Recently, UNESCO, World Resources Institute (WRI) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) released this report.More in News

• Report provides the first global scientific assessment of greenhouse gas emissions and sequestration by forests in UNESCO World Heritage sites (WHS).o UNESCO World Heritage forests (WHF), which cover 69 million hectares, hold 13 billion tonnes of carbon (Gt C) in vegetation and soils.o Most of the World Heritage Forest carbon is stored in tropical sites

• Report estimates that forests across WHS removed approximately 190 million tonnes of CO2 per year between 2001 and 2020 from the atmosphere.Key Findings of the report

• Over the past 20 years, WHS lost 3.5 million hectares of forest and forests in 10 World Heritage sites emitted more carbon than they absorbed

• Two most widespread threats (reported in about 60% sites) to UNESCO WHF are o Climate change with associated severe weather (e.g., fires, storms, floods, droughts, temperature extremes, and habitat shifting/alteration).o Land-use pressures associated with various human activities such as illegal logging, wood harvesting, and agricultural encroachment due to livestock farming/grazing and crops. • India’s Sundarbans National Park is among five sites that have the highest blue carbon stocks globally.64 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS About World Heritage sites

• World Heritage Sites are cultural and/or natural sites of ‘Outstanding Universal Value’, which are important across countries and generations.o UNESCO seeks to encourage the identification, protection, and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity.o This is embodied in Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972

• They are distributed across more than 110 countries and cover approximately 350 million hectares (Mha). Collectively, they include almost 1% of the Earth’s land surface and 0.6% of the world’s oceans

• In addition to their Outstanding Universal Value and globally important contribution to biodiversity conservation, these sites also contribute to the well-being of local communities and wider human society.

• World Heritage sites also provide crucial ecosystem services, as two-thirds of sites are critical sources of fresh water, and about half help prevent hazards such as floods or landslides.o Blue carbon is the organic carbon (mainly obtained from decaying plant leaves, wood, roots and animals) stored in coastal and marine ecosystems.o Blue carbon ecosystems include seagrass meadows, tidal marshes and mangroves.Recommendations to protect UNESCO WHS and maintain their climate benefits
• Rapid response to climate-related events and maintaining and strengthening ecological connectivity through improved landscape management.o Some WHS have already taken steps to better manage climate-related risks by✓ Adopting climate change adaptation plans (Mount Kenya National Park/Natural Forest in Kenya)✓ Supporting disaster risk reduction initiatives through coastal protection and flood regulation (e.g., Sundarbans in Bangladesh and Sundarbans National Park in India).

• Support mechanisms that maximize intactness and connectivity of forests.o The fragmentation of the forest landscape around sites can generate increased carbon emissions and disrupt ecological connectivity and the stability of carbon stocks.o Integrated landscape management and the creation of ecological corridors and buffer zones have been promoted as initiatives to address these challenges.• Integrating continued protection of WHS into climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development strategies.o This should be in line with the Paris climate agreement, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the Sustainable Development Goals.5.10. CORAL REEFWhy in news? Recently, the report ‘Sixth status of the Corals of the World’ by Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) stated that 14% of Coral reefs are lost since 2010. More about news • The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) is an operational network of the International Coral Reef Initiative that aims to provide the best available scientific information on the status and trends of coral reef ecosystems for their conservation and management. o The GCRMN is a global network of scientists, managers and organisations that monitor the condition of coral reefs throughout the world. 65 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Where are Coral Reefs found?

• These are found in more than 100 countries around the world.

• Most reefs are located between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. o Corals are also found farther from the equator in places where warm currents flow out of the tropics, such as in Florida and southern Japan.• In India, Coral reefs are present in the areas of: o Gulf of Kutcho Gulf of Mannaro Andaman & Nicobaro Lakshadweep Islands and Malvan• The flagship product of the GCRMN is the ‘Status of Coral Reefs of the World report’, that describes the status and trends of coral reefs worldwide. • The global dataset spanned more than 40 years from 1978 to 2019 and consisted of observations from73reef  bearingcountriesaroundtheworld.Key findings • Corals reefs across the world are under relentless stress from warming caused by climate change and other local pressures such as overfishing, unsustainable coastal development and declining water quality. • There has been a steady decrease in hard coral cover in the last four decades since 1978 when the world lost 9%of its corals.• Large-scale coral bleaching events caused by elevated sea surface temperatures (SST) are the greatest disturbance to the world’s coral reefs.o The 1998 event alone killed 8% of the world's coral. • Since 2010, the amount of algae on the world's coral reefs has increased by about 20 per cent. o Algal bloom on coral ridges are a sign of stress on the structures.About Coral Reefs • Coral reefs are large underwater structures composed of the skeletons of colonial marine invertebrates called coral. o The coral species that build reefs are known as Hard Corals because they extract calcium carbonate from seawater to create a hard, durable exoskeleton that protects their soft, sac-like bodies.o The other species of corals that are not involved in reef building are known as Soft Corals. • Each individual coral is referred to as a polyp. Coral polyps live on the calcium carbonate exoskeletons of their ancestors, adding their own exoskeleton to the existing coral structure. • The Corals have a symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, relationship with the zooxanthellae.o The zooxanthellae provide the coral with their lively colors. Most coral polyp bodies are clear and colorless without zooxanthellae.• About 25% of all known marine species rely on coral reefs for food, shelter and breeding. o These are sometimes referred to as ‘the rainforests of the sea’ for their biodiversity. Threats• Ocean Acidification: The increasing acidification of the ocean caused when oceans absorb immense amounts of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere inhibits coral's ability to produce the calcium carbonate exoskeletons they rely on for shelter. o With increased CO2 in the water, coral may form weaker skeletons, making them more vulnerable to disease and destruction by storms.• Coral Bleaching: When corals are stressed due to warmer ocean waters, the corals eject the symbiotic algae that live inside them when stressed. When corals lose their algae, they lose their built-in food source.• Water pollution: Agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, oil and gasoline, sewage discharge and sediment from eroded landscapes make it difficult for coral to thrive, and therefore damage the complex relationships that exist among the plants, coral and other animals that. • Sea level rise: As the planet gets warmer, glaciers melt, causing sea level to rise. Thus, corals are predicted to end up deeper underwater, receive less sunlight and grow more slowly. • Stronger Storms: Stronger, more frequent storms, hurricanes, cyclones can break coral branches and overturn coral colonies.66 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Unsustainable fishing: Practices such as cyanide fishing (spraying cyanide in the water stuns the fish to make them easier to catch), ‘blast fishing’ with explosives and overfishing with trawlers can destroy a thousand-year-old coral reef in a matter of minutes. • Habitat Destruction: Many activities such as Coral mining, construction, Coral collecting, destructive fishing methods, unsustainable tourism, Mangrove destruction affect the habitat and impact coral reefs adversely. Conclusion Maintaining the integrity and resilience of coral reef ecosystems is essential for the wellbeing of tropical coastal communities worldwide and a critical part of the solution for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.5.11. INTERNATIONAL SOLAR ALLIANCEWhy in News?India introduced a draft resolution in the UN General Assembly for granting Observer Status for the International solar Alliance (ISA).More in news• The United Nations General Assembly may grant Permanent Observer Status to non-member states, international organisations and other entities. Observer status would be confined to states and intergovernmental organisations whose activities cover matters of interest to the Assembly.o The Permanent Observers may participate in the sessions and workings of the General Assembly and maintain missions at the U.N. headquarters.• The granting of Observer Status to the ISA in the General Assembly would help provideforaregularandwell  definedcooperationbetweentheAlliance and the United Nations that would benefit global energy growth and development.About ISA• It was launched at Paris Climate Change Conference in 2015 by the President of France and the Prime Minister of India.• It is a multi-country partnership organization with membership from solar resource rich countries between the two tropics, where the global community can make a positive contribution towards increasing the use of solar energy.o It has now been decided to extend the membership of the alliance to all the UN member states.• The body aims to scale up solar energy applications, take coordinated action through programmes and activities launched on a voluntary basis and facilitate collaborative research and development activities in solar energy technologies.o Each Member shares and updates, for those solar applications for which it seeks the benefits of collective action under the ISA. 67 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Till October 2021, 101 countries have signed the ISA Framework Agreement and 80 countries have signed and ratified the ISA Framework Agreement.• ISA is the first international organization headquartered in India.Significance of ISA• Supporting the implementation of United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change and the global climate agenda: Solar energy is harnessed from nature free of cost and is abundantly available. This is in contrast to oil and gas-based energy, which are located in specific parts of the world like West Asia, some parts of North Africa as well as in Eurasia along with the United States.• Break their monopoly over oil and gas: Since most of the member states of the ISA are poorer countries, they can join together and bargain with the oil- rich countries to break their monopoly over oil and gas. o For instance, India, which is emerging as the hub of solar energy, being one of ISA's founders, can reduce its energy dependence on the West Asian countries.• Standard of living of the population: As most countries are located between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, use of solar energy for electricity generation can significantly meet the requirement of local population which, in turn, would improve the standard of living of the population.• Reduce geopolitical conflicts: Most energy-dependent countries used to import the bulk of conventional energy like oil, gas and coal energies from faraway places and by paying heavy prices. This created most of the geopolitical conflicts in the 20th century.• Help to reduce radicalization: It has also been observed that growing radicalisation in different parts of the world can be attributed to energy geopolitics. o The Boko Haram terrorist group of Nigeria, religious extremists of Russia's North Caucasus region along with other Caspian states and the ISIS of West Asia are some good examples to demonstrate how religious extremists use oil money to further their objectives.• Ensure global equity: ISA gives representation to countries like Fiji and South Sudan, along with advanced countries like Australia and France, thus taking a step to ensure global equity.Initiatives taken by ISA• Green Grids Initiative - One Sun, One World, One Grid (OSOWOG): It is launched by India at the global climate conference COP26 with an aim to harness solar energy wherever the Sun is shining, ensuring that generated electricity flows to areas that need it most.o It aims to build a framework for a global cooperation initiative targeted at effective utilisation of renewable sources across the globe and accelerate the mobilisation of technical and financial resources needed to advance action on green grids.✓ It is aimed at addressing the issue of high cost of energy storage.• ISA partnered with Bloomberg Philanthropies to mobilize $1 trillion in global investments for solar energy across ISA’s member countries.• Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) launched at COP26 with USD10 billions of committed capital to accelerate investment in green energy transitions and renewable energy solutions in developing and emerging economies. • ISA’s Programme on Scaling Solar Applications for Agriculture Use (SSAAU) focuses on providing greater energy access and a sustainable irrigation solution to farmers through deployment of Solar Water Pumping Systems in member countries.• Supported governments to make their energy legislation and policies solar friendly through Ease of Doing Solar analytics and advisory.5.12. URBAN FIRE RISKWhy in News?Recently, a 60-floor residential building caught fire in Mumbai with initial responses pointing out absence of six-monthly fire audit and failure of fire-fighting system to respond automatically.68 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Urban Fires in India• Urban Fire: Since Industrial Revolution, Urban Fire, i.e., the fire which primarily occurs in cities or towns, is a major risk to people’s life, property, and public security. • Extent: As per National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) 2020 data, 9,329 incidents of fire accidents happened in India with the death of 9,110 people.● Impact: With 57.6% of the total deaths being reported in residential buildings, urban fires have a devastating impact on-○ People's health due to asphyxiation, release of the toxic gases and explosions/bursts caused by it.○ Communities due to the breaking up of economic activities and environmental destruction.Causes for Urban FiresPrimarily, caused by the interaction between the fire accidents and urban vulnerability, impacts of these incidents get compounded by poor mitigation measures. Urban Vulnerabilities • Rapid and Unplanned Urbanization due to higher urban population growth and poor urban planningleads to rise in informal settlements (e.g. Slums) and industries/commercial areas within residential areas.• Congested roads/wiring due to high urban density and electricity demand, i.e. tightly packed dwelling units with congested overhead wires.High Fire Accident Frequency• High incidents of cooking cylinders and Electric short-circuits in urban commercial and residential areas due to faulty equipment or wiring. • High incidents of Human Errors due to negligence like smoking; leaving appliances ON; and misuse or incorrect use of equipment etc.• Natural and Climatic Reasons, i.e., weather phenomenon like lightning, earthquakes, heat waves or low humidity, also plays role in urban fires. E.g. Fire in slums during hot dry summers is common in India.Poor Prevention/ Mitigation measures• Lack of Compliance to fire Safety Standards by commercial and residential buildings such as operational fire system or equipment, presence and identification of escape routes, etcWhat is the current institutional framework for Fire prevention? • Constitutional Provisions: Under Twelfth Schedule (Article 243W), the Fire Services come under the power, authority, and responsibility of Urban Local Bodies.○ So, either municipalities or the State Government/UTs look after the fire services in India through local building bye laws.• Model Building Bye laws: First released by the Ministry of Urban Development in 2003, it provides for Chief Fire Officer to scrutinize and approve/reject building plans on Fire Safety.• National Building Code of India: First published by the Bureau of Indian Standards, it is a comprehensive building code with detailed guidelines for construction, maintenance, and fire safety of the structures.○ In 2016, the 3rd edition of NBC was published with over 150 standards on fire safety.○ This includes the Part-IV (Fire and Life Safety) with detailed provisions on fire prevention, life safety and fire protection to be incorporated by states in their building bye laws and implement.• Provide for the Maintenance of a Fire and Emergency Service for the State: It is the model bill circulated by the Disaster Management Division under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for proper operational and regulation measures including enforcement and liabilities along with set up of “Fire Prevention and Life Safety Fund”.NBC norms under Part-IV (Fire and Life Safety)Containing detailed provisions on fire prevention, life safety and fire protection, it provides for:• The requirements for fire prevention, life safety in relation to fire and fire protection of buildings.• It also specifies occupancy-wise classification, constructional aspects, egress requirements and protection features that are necessary to minimize danger to life and property from fire. • This includes the General Exit requirements like announcement and Voice guided/aided system in high rise buildings; Standards for construction (stairs, ramps etc.), active and passive fire protection systems installation, Restrictions on buildings in each fire zone, classifies height-width parameters etc.69 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS What can be done to overcome these constraints? The increasing urbanization level and frequency of fire instances, especially at hospitals, in India makes it vital to have a holistic approach to tackle Urban Fire Risk through different components of fire safety such as:Component of Fire SafetyMeasuresLegal and Administrative• Risk Identification: Carry out Baseline assessments to understand how fire safety interventions operate within the local building regulatory environment to start for a holistic approach.• Updating laws and regulations: To strengthen the guidelines and policy framework with proper enforcement of building bye laws, planning and zoning requirements in every state and UT.Development and Maintenance • Removing Constraints: Fill up vacant posts with upgradation of Fire Safety equipments and infrastructure for overall capacity building of fire fighting system. o E.g., the Standing Fire Advisory Council (SFAC, under MHA) report highlighted high deficiencies in Indian Fire Fighting system such as 97.54% in fire stations, 80.04% in fire vehicles and 96.28% in fire personnel.• Technological Upgradation: Promote use of facilities like automatic smoke alarm, sprinklers, gas leakage alarm etc. with built-in fire suppression system or technologies to aerially track the fire incidents.• Risk Reduction: Either through retrofitting or new construction, the old and congested urban spaces with high risk should be made safe and accessible. It will help in improving response time as well.LocalImplementation• Create a Culture of Fire Safety: Promoting Community Engagement and early education on Fire Safety can help in building community resilience and overcome the issues of people apathy or errors.• Building of Sustainable Cities: Most importantly, develop each city as sustainable city for domestic capabilities, helping to overcome domestic and global challenges such as unplanned urbanization (e.g., from slums) and natural risks (e.g., from global warming), etc.5.13.

MINISTRY OF POWER (MOP) NOTIFIES RULES FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR AND PROMOTION OF CLEAN ENERGY• New rules are notified (under Electricity Act, 2003) to sustain economic viability of the sector, ease 74 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS financial stress of various stakeholders and ensure timely recovery of costs involved in electricity generation.• Renewable energy (RE) sector has been facing following issueso Various states have sought to cut procurement from renewables or renegotiate power purchase agreements (PPAs) citing lower tariffs for solar power.o Inordinate payment delays by states such as Telangana.o Delays in land acquisition and clearances,regulatory uncertainty, inadequate grid connectivity etc.• Key highlights of the ruleso Compensation shall be payable by the procurerin the event of a curtailment of supply from a must-run power plant.o Must run status means that the concerned power plant has to supply electricity to the grid under all conditions.o RE generator is also allowed to sell power in the power exchange and recover the cost suitably.• These rules will help in achieving the targets of RE generation, will ensure that the consumers get green and clean power, will help in creating investment friendly environment etc.5.13.16. TERRESTRIAL WATERS• Recently, a Report ‘2021 State of Climate Services’ released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that terrestrial water storage (TWS) dropped at a rate of 1 cm per year in 20 years (2002-2021). • Terrestrial water storage can be defined as the summation of all water on the land surface and in the subsurface.o It includes surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, groundwater, snow, ice, water stored in the vegetation, river and lake water.o TWS modulates the hydrological cycle and is a key determinant of water availability and an indicator of drought.• Key findingso TWS dropped at a rate of 1 cm per year in 20 years (2002-2021).o The biggest losses have occurred in Antarctica and Greenland. Many highly populated, lower latitude locations have also experienced TWS losses.o Human- and naturally induced stressors are increasingly adding pressure on water resources.✓ Socio-economic factors, such as population growth and urbanization on one hand, and environ- mental phenomena, such as decreasing freshwater availability and extreme weather events, on the other, are displaying their effects across sectors and regions.o In India, the TWS has been lost at a rate of at least 3 cm per year. In some regions, the loss has been over 4 cm per year too. ✓ India has recorded the highest loss in terrestrial water storage if the loss of water storage in Antarctica and Greenland is excluded. ✓ India is the ‘topmost hotspot of TWS losses.✓ The northern part of India has experienced the maximum loss within the country. o In India, the average annual per capita water availability has been consistently decreasing. It is projected to further decrease to 1,367 cubic metres in 2031, according to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. ✓ The five of the 21 river basins in India are ‘absolute water scarce’ (per capita water availability below 500 cubic metres). ✓ Five are ‘water scarce’ (per capita water availability below 1,000 cubic metres) and three are ‘water stressed’ (per capita water availability below 1,700 cubic metres). ✓ By 2050, six will become absolute water scarce, six will become water scarce and four will become water stressed, according to the State of India’s Environment in figures, 2020.• Recommendations to improve the implementation and effectiveness of climate services for water worldwideo Invest in Integrated Resources Water Management as a solution to better manage water stress, especially in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).o Invest in end-to-end drought and flood early warning systems in at-risk LDCs, including for drought warning in Africa and flood warning in Asia.o Fill the capacity gap in collecting data for basic hydrological variables which underpin climate services and early warning systems.75 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 5.13.17. BANNI BUFFALO• Recently, India’s First Banni Buffalo in vitro fertilization (IVF) Calf was born in Gujarat.• Banni buffaloes are distributed in the Kachchh region of Gujarat.o Banni, which was evolved by the Maldhari community in this region, has good adaptability to harsh climatic conditions, drought resistance and survival on scanty fodder and shrubs.5.13.18. ALLIUM NEGIANUM• A plant discovered in Uttarakhand in 2019 has been confirmed as a new species of Allium, the genus that includes many staple foods such as onion and garlic.o Although new to science, the species has long been known under domestic cultivation to local communities.o With a narrow distribution, this newly described species is restricted to the region of western Himalayas and hasn’t yet been reported from anywhere else in the world.76 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 6. SOCIAL ISSUES6.1. DRUG ABUSEWhy in news?Calling for a humane approach towards drug users and addicts, the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has recommended changes to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act to exempt them from a prison term.More about news• The ministry has suggested that drug users and addicts be treated as ‘victims’ who need de-addiction and rehabilitation. Criminal action should not be taken against them. • It has also called for decriminalising possession of ‘small quantities’ of drugs for personal consumption.Drug abuse: Meaning, causes and extent in India• What is Drug abuse?: Drug abuse or Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. Psychoactive substances are substances that, when taken in or administered into one's system, affect mental processes. • Causes of Drug abuse:• Extent of Drug abuse in India: From traditional plant-based drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin to synthetic drugs such as tramadol, consumption of narcotic substances in India has increased manifold in recent years. In terms of users. India's illicit drug markets are mostly dominated by cannabis and opioids.77 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS o According to the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry and All India Institute of Medical Sciences’ report on magnitude of substance abuse in 2019, there were 3.1 crore cannabis users and 2.3 crore opioid users. o Consumption across states: Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of cannabis users, followed by Punjab, Sikkim, Chhattisgarh, and Delhi, according to the AIIMS report.✓ Of the total opioid users, nearly 77 lakh or over one-third are in the harmful or drug-dependent category due to excess use. Roughly one-third of such cases are from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi.✓ However, in terms of population percentage, the north-eastern states top the list. Nearly seven per cent of the population in Mizoram, for instance, consume opioids.Major Initiatives taken by government to curb drug abuse• Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act): It was enacted with the objective to make stringent provisions and consolidate the law in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. o The Act created Narcotics Control Bureau which carries out functions like coordination among various agencies engaged in drug law enforcement, collection, and dissemination of intelligence etc.• Central Sector Scheme of Assistance for Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drugs) Abuse for Social Defence Services: The scheme helps Voluntary Organizations for Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug abuse.• The Mental Health Care Act (2017) has included alcohol and drug use disorders under its ambit. This measure is likely to increase the availability and access to the minimum standard of care and rehabilitation for people with substance use disorders.• National Survey: To analyse the extent of drug abuse in the country, Government conducted the first National Survey on Extent and Pattern of Substance Use in India through the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC) of the AIIMS, New Delhi during 2018.• National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction (NAPDDR) for 2018-2025: Formulated and implemented by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, it aims at reduction of adverse consequences of drug abuse through a multi-pronged strategy involving Awareness generation programmes, Community outreach, Capacity Building Programmes etc.• ‘Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan’ or a ‘Drugs-Free India Campaign’ launched in 2020 across 272 districts of the country found to be most vulnerable based on the data available from various sources.• UN Conventions: India is a party to the three United Nations drug conventions: Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 and Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988.Issues in curbing Drug Abuse in India• India acts as a hub for drug trafficking: Geographically, India lies between the Golden triangle and the golden crescent, the major opium production regions in the world making it a hub for drug trafficking in the continent.• Treatment gap: The National Mental Health Survey (2015-2016) showed a treatment gap of more than 70 per cent for drug use disorders. Further, merely five per cent of people with illicit drug use disorders received inpatient care. This indicates poor accessibility, utilization and quality of health care. o There is an acute shortage of psychiatrists and counsellors for de-addiction.• India’s approach to drug consumption: India sees drug consumption as a criminal offence, believing that criminalising drug use is the strongest symbol of society’s condemnation.• Organized nature: Since drug peddling is an organised crime, it is challenging for the police to catch the persons involved from the point of source to the point of destination. 78 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Practices around the globe that can be replicated in India• Portugal: After Portugal decriminalised the personal use and possession of all illicit drugs in July, 2001, the HIV transmission rate that was once highest amongst all the European Union countries, have plummeted and the usage of drugs amidst certain vulnerable groups have decreased.• Iceland: Iceland witnessed acute drug abuse among its children and the youth. The government decided to tackle the issue right from the school level. From introducing aptitude tests which revealed the inclinations of students to persuading parents to keep liquor and cigarettes out of reach of the youth. It has successfully weaned away 70-80% of its young population from drugs.o Also, drug abuse is being seen as a complex problem because it is internally linked with other serious crimes such as organized crimes, human trafficking, and money laundering.• Advancement in technology: Increased digital penetration and use of the dark web by online markets, rapid proliferation of internet-based pharmacies and bitcoin-based transactions has further enhanced the accessibility of drugs. • Increased vulnerabilities due to pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the factors that fuel the vicious circle of socio-economic vulnerabilityand drug use disorders (Refer infographic)What can be done to overcome these issues? • Scientific evidence-based treatment at the required scale: Considering the wide treatment gap (mismatch between demand and availability of treatment services), India needs massive investments in enhancing the avenues for treatment. Optimum allocation of resources for treatment of substance use disorders is imperative.• Evidence-based substance use prevention programmes: Prevention programmes must aim at not just preventing substance use but ensuring that young people grow and stay healthy into adulthood, enabling them to realize their potential and become productive members of their community and society.• Changed outlook towards drug abuse: Awareness programmes can play an important role in establishing substance use disorders as bio-psycho-social health conditions (and not just moral failings). Enhancing the awareness in the society can be an effective tool in minimizing the stigma associated with substance use.• Other Steps: There needs to be an efficient coordinationbetween the drug supply control sector as well as the entities involved in drug demand reduction and harm reduction. o Various nongovernment organizations and nonprofit organizations can be involved to initiate vocational training and other employment programs for unemployed addicts.o Appropriate linkages between health workers, community leaders, religious leaders, and teachers for planning prevention and rehabilitation activities for drug abuse should be established.6.2. GAMING DISORDERWhy in news?The gaming disorder is quickly growing as the pandemic spurred an increased use of Internet devices.More on news• According to the All India Gaming Federation, India’s online gaming industry is expected to be worth ₹15,500 crore by 2023.• A 2019 survey by the U.S.-based Limelight Networks found that o India had the second largest number of gamers after South Korea, and 79 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS o While time spent online is still not as high as in other countries, it found that almost a quarter of adult Indian gamers had missed work while playing games.• Last month, China limited gamers under 18 years to just three hours of online games per week, during specified times, and made the industry responsible for enforcing the restriction.About gaming disorders• The World Health Organization (WHO) categorised gaming disorder as a mental health condition in 2018.• According to the WHO’s definition, a person who has gaming disorder will show the following characteristics for at least 12 months:o Lacking control over their gaming habits.o Prioritizing gaming over other interests and activities.o Continuing gaming despite its negative consequences.• Thus, according to WHO, the criteria doesn't include a certain number of hours spent playing. Instead, the description is of someone with an inability to stop playing even though it interferes with other areas of one's life, such as family relationships, school, work, and sleep. • Consequenceso Gaming disorders cause physical, social and emotional damages, impairing sleep, appetites, careers and social lives. o A Delhi-based NGO named the Distress Management Collective documented other ways in which online gaming could lead to financial distress. “For a poor family, even the money needed to recharge a mobile phone to feed a gaming addiction can bankrupt a family.o People who remain physically inactive for extended periods due to gaming may also have a higher risk of obesity, sleep problems, and other health issues.Way ahead• Legal: Psychiatrists recommend that as a bare minimum, statutory warnings and mandatory breaks should be enforced to prevent binge gaming. Among those who are just beginning excessive use, enforcing breaks after a stipulated time will improve control and prevent bingeing. • Digital fasting: Digital fasting among families are also important steps to combat the disorder.• Treatment: Gaming disorder is a new classification, so there is no clear treatment plan in place yet. However, it is likely that treatments for other addictive behaviors, such as gambling addiction, will also be relevant for gaming disorder. These may include:Case study: Gaming to gambling • NIMHANS published a case study in the Industrial Psychiatry Journal last year illustrating the “pathways of migration from gaming to gambling”. • They found that a 14-year-old addicted to online games without monetary rewards later became addicted to online poker with financial stakes in his early 20s. • Individuals who played more social casino games (online games where you do not either bet or win or lose real money) and won occasionally, usually developed a craving and urge for betting real money in the anticipation of winning.80 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 6.3. MEDICAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCYWhy in News?Recently, the Union Government notified the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Rules, 2021 under section 6 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP Act), 1971.More on News• The new rules will amend the 2003 rules to define eligibility criteria for termination of pregnancy and other conditions based on the amendments to MTP Act by parliament in March 2021.• The amendments allow for setting up a Medical Board with increase in limit for termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks against previous upper limit of 20 weeks.Salient Features of New Rules• Defines powers and functions of State level Medical Board (set up through latest amendments to MTP Act, 1971 in 2021) such as:o Examine the woman and her reports, when approached for medical termination of pregnancy,o Allow or deny termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks of gestation period, ensuring safety of procedure for women and identify substantial risk to life or lifelong physical and mental handicaps foetal malformationwithin fixed timeframe,o Co-opt other specialists in the Board and ask for any additional investigations if required, to decide termination of pregnancy.• Identifies categories of women eligible for termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks as  o survivors of sexual assault or rape or incest; minors; o change of marital status during the ongoing pregnancy (widowhood and divorce); o women with physical disabilities (as per the 2016 Act criteria); o mentally ill women including mental retardation; o foetal malformation carrying substantial risk of life or of physical and mental abnormalities for serious handicap; and o women with pregnancy in humanitarian settings or disaster or emergency situations as may be declared by the Government.• Specifies Eligibility criteria of Registered Medical Practitioner to conduct termination of pregnancy up to 9 weeks, 12 weeks, 12-20 weeks etc.For more information, please refer to Article 6.1: Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 of March 2021 edition of VisionIAS Monthly Current Affairs Magazine.What is need for an abortion law? • Ensuring health and safety of women: Without law, illegal abortions fill the vacuum, with increased risks of unsafe procedures, infections etc. So, through hygienic and legally safe abortion service to women on therapeutic, eugenic, humanitarian, or social grounds. Medical termination of pregnancy reduces illegal abortion, maternal mortality, and morbidity as well.• Strengthening reproductive rights: Providing legal support ensures dignity, autonomy, confidentiality, and justice for women who need to terminate pregnancy.• Encouraging societal acceptance for choice: Creation of a law can help spearhead the movement of reproductive rights for women akin to the evolution experienced in the case of Dowry Prohibition. • Enabling Medical Practitioners: Prevalence of a law protects the medical practitioners and at the same time acts as a guide in navigating difficult social situations.What is the crux of the abortion issue: The Pro-Life vs Pro-Choice DebatePro-Choice Movement (Focus on Mother) Pro-Life Movement (Focus on Child)With strong basis in reproductive rights of women, the Pro-Choice movement is represented by people who are for medical abortion. With strong basis in religion and rights of unborn child, the Pro-life movement is represented by people who are 81 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Benefits of the scheme• Bring about a paradigm shift in India’s healthcare infrastructure and make it more resilient.• Address gaps and strengthen the critical health care network from village and block to the district and national level.• Make India ready to effectively manage any future pandemics and health emergencies.The major socio-ethical arguments used to support it are:• Women autonomy rights over body,• Birth defects (genetic abnormalities) which are lethal (cause death) or lead to lifelong suffering takes heavy toll on parents through moral distress and posttraumatic stress.• State can’t overlook the age (minor) and mental health of women (mentally ill). Also, rape victims should have freedom of choice on pregnancy termination, to ensure dignity and justice.• No child should be brought unwanted.against medical abortion. The major socio-ethicalarguments used to support it are:• Fetus rights of personhood,• Misuses of prenatal diagnosis for sex-determination as well as scarce availability of such technologies in our society. The birth defects may get treatment in future • Against humanity and state has an obligation to protect all life including fetus. E.g. Texas anti  abortion law (banning abortion if medical professionals can detect cardiac activity).Challenges in implementing the MTP Act in India• Shortage of qualified doctors: In India, especially in rural areas, India lacks the qualified Medical Practitioners. E.g. As per All-India Rural Health Statistics (2018-19), India has 1,351 gynecologists and obstetricians in community health clinics in rural areas across India, and the shortfall is 4,002, i.e., there is a 75% shortage of qualified doctors.• Shortage of Health Infrastructure: Around 15.6 million abortions happen in India every year. Also, as per National Health and Family Survey, 2015-16, only 53% of abortions performed by registered medical doctor in India while balance are conducted by a nurse, auxiliary nurse midwife, family member of self.• Awareness on Laws: Majority of people lack awareness on laws and its provisions. This makes enforcement and application extremely difficult. • Social Stigma: In many cases, due to issues like loss of privacy, victims of rape etc., families may avoid using formal means of abortion. • Religious Opposition: Several inscriptions and religious texts, in one form or the other, oppose the idea of abortion. This hinders development of social acceptance and hence leads to limited usage of the law. Way ForwardThe regulation of medical termination should be centered around the woman and the child. Keeping this in mind, following principles can be adopted in regulation to ensure that health, safety, and privacy of the women and at the same time growing gradual societal acceptance for the process:1. Engage religious leaders to enhance spiritual values. 2. Ensure confidentiality of process. 3. Make people realize value of human life to avoid any misuse. 4. Improve awareness on effective use of contraceptives to avoid its misuse. 5. Family life education to help couples for a planned parenthood. 6. Overcome shortage of qualified doctors and improve infrastructure in rural India. 7. Improve law and order situation to address moot issues like rape, incest etc., i.e., overcoming circumstances for the use of law. 6.4.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY7.1. PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN SPACEWhy in news?The Prime Minister recently launched the Indian Space Association (ISpA), an industry body consisting of various stakeholders of the Indian space domain.More about news• The industry association will act as an independent and a “single-window” agency for enabling the opening up of the space sector to start-ups and the private sector. • ISpA will also work towards building global linkages for the Indian space industry to bring in critical technology and investments into the country to create more high-skill jobs. • Space reforms via IsPA, will be based on “four pillars” of space technology: o The freedom to innovate in the private sector; o Making the government act as an enabler;o Preparing the next generation for the future of the space industry; and o Ensuring that the space sector is used as a common resource for the progress of humanity.Status of India’s Space industry • Driven by public sector: India’s space programme is one of the most well-developed in the world and is driven by a state-owned agency- the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).• High economic potential: The current global space economy is estimated at US$ 360 billion, with India accounting for ~2% (US$ 7 billion). The Indian space sector is projected to increase at a ~48% CAGR over the next five years to reach US$ 50 billion.• Limited participation in satellite and ground based services: In the global space market, rocket and satellite launch services, an area in which ISRO specialises, amount to only 5% share. Satellite-based services and ground-based systems account for the remaining 95%.At present, the government drives a certain level of participation by the Indian private sector, primarily in the rocket and satellite launch services segment. However, enhanced private sector participation will be necessary to penetrate satellite-based services and ground-based system segments.Need for private sector participation• Growing demand: ISRO alone can’t cater to the rising demand for space-based applications and services within India. Almost every sector, starting from agriculture to transport, now wants satellite data and space technology to draw their future strategy.o It has been estimated that ISRO would have to increase its present size by 10 times to cater to the growing demand within India.• To enable ISRO to fulfil its strategic objectives: Currently, a lot of ISRO’s resources are being consumed by routine activities, causing delays in its strategic objectives. If private companies take over these activities, ISRO will be able to focus more on strategic programmes like R&D activities, exploration missions and human spaceflight programme.• Increase India’s share in global space market: Indian space sector has the potential to capture close to 9% of global market share by 2030, which cannot be achieved without private sector’s participation.• To secure our space capabilities and make them more robust: This can be done by distributing them across many different satellites and spacecraft, so that business continuity is unaffected even if an adversary manages to disable one or more of our satellites. The more critical the function, the more the diversity required.The gamut of Space activities envisaged to be taken up by private sector• Production of components and subsystems of a launch vehicle, launch vehicle integration and testing which is meant for space launch.• Production of components of a spacecraft, spacecraft Integration and testing for the purpose of space launches.• Space launch of spacecraft on board a launch vehicle and establishment/ operation of launch infrastructure.• Providing space-based services including operation, control and station keeping of spacecraft by establishing and operation of ground segment/ stations.• Development of space-based applications using satellite data and rolling out of commercial services.89 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS Concerns related to Private sector participation• Monopolistic trends: Space technology is expensive and needs heavy investment. This kind of lucrative power is available only with selected rich corporates, thus can lead to monopolisation of the sector.• Social welfare may take a backseat: The space program by ISRO always worked on applications like remote sensing, tracking of land use, resource mapping etc., enhancing social welfare. However, private companies will have more profitable interests than developing solutions that cater to the immediate socio-economic needs of the country.• To expand satellite-based services: As of August 2021, India had only 3 lakh satellite communications customers, compared with 45 lakh in the US and 21 lakh in the European Union. Private sector can facilitate development of a cost-effective product or a service, thus creating large base of new consumers.• To achieve our geopolitical objectives: The availability and demonstration of emerging technologies have a great significance in defining the modern-day geopolitics. Hence, given the current geopolitical situation of the country and security threats, growth in the space sector can help the country gain leverage over others.• NewSpace in India: NewsSpace is a global phenomenon of entrepreneurs developing products, and service enterprises focusing on space, using private funding. Basic ethos of the NewSpace has been to challenge the traditional ways of space exploration that are widely considered as too expensive, time-consuming and lacking in room for inventive risk-taking.o Companies that fit in the bracket of NewSpace include the likes of SpaceX, OneWeb, and Planet Labs, which are primarily funded by private capital.• Other factors include attracting innovation and cutting-edge technology, enhanced competitiveness, creation of job opportunities, realising vision of Aatma nirbhar Bharat and reducing dependence on taxpayer’s money.Challenges associated with Private Sector participation• Conflicts of interest: As ISRO is both a regulator and an operator, this conflict of interest is likely to manifest during dispute resolution between private players and ISRO entities. o Even though IN-SPACe (Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre) is meant to be an independent agency, it falls under the ambit of ISRO, causing potential conflicts of interest.• Procedural hurdles: Companies have often cited multiplicity of approvals and procedural ambiguity as barriers. For example, in 2017, Hughes, a US-based company, had announced a US$ 500 million satellite communications system in India but company has not yet received any approvals or an expected timeline.• Lack of clarity on level of private involvement: There is a lack of clarity regarding definition and scope of private involvement in the space sector given that governments still consider some domains in space too crucial for national interest to allow private participation.• Absence of coherent policy: There is an absence of a coherent policy framework at the national level, which could provide support and guidelines to technology manufacturing businesses, including tax rebates or other advantages of operating in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ).• Limited technological advancements: As ISRO works on the traditional vendor-supplier model, most intellectualproperty (IP) is owned by the organisation. This has hindered the technological advancements of Indian companies.o Currently, private players (operating satellites) have a 100% FDI limit that is subject to government approvalwhich may be prolonged for years.Charting the road ahead• Regulatory clarity: The purpose of regulation must be to ensure compliance with India’s international obligations, ensuring safety, covering liabilities and standardization. Improved regulatory environment would mean fewer barriers of entry for private firms.o There is a need for legislation providing procedural clarity to facilitate ISRO’s partnership with industries and entrepreneurs. Rekindling debate on draft Space Activities Bill could be a good start. Recent steps taken for private sector participation• To enhance utilization and maximize benefits from the space assets, it has been proposed to change the approach from “Supply Based Model” to “Demand Based Model”.• IN-SPACe was created to encourage, promote and hand hold the private sector for their participation in Space Sector. Private players will also be able to use ISRO infrastructure through INSPACe.• New Space India Limited (NSIL) is the commercial arm of ISRO and primarily responsible for enabling Indian industries to take up high-tech, space-related activities. It is also responsible for promotion and commercialisation of products and services in the space industry.90 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Independent regulator: Creating an independent regulator to govern ISRO and its affiliates as well as new private sector firms can help in instilling confidence among private players. Separate licences can be awarded for different classes of launch vehicles, orbits and services.• Incentives to private companies: By opening up ISRO testing facilities to the private sector, Indian rocket-making companies will be able to build their satellites or test their rockets, reducing cost and increasing incentives for firms to build operational spacecraft. • FDI reforms: Government can consider implementing the telecommunications FDI model, which allows investments (up to 49%) under the automatic route and investments (>50%) through the government’s approval.• Other steps: o IP-centric policy to create reforms where local industry can invest in building their own IP and/or products that can match global standards;o Enable a level playing field for the private sector through burden-sharing between the public and private actors;o There is a need for collaboration and integrated conversations between various stakeholders who need to come together to help establish a suitable framework for space policy and governance.7.2. NOBEL PRIZESWhy in news?The Nobel Assembly and the Royal Swedish Academy of Science have announced the winners of Medicine, Physics and Chemistry Nobel for the year 2021.About Nobel Prize• The Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden, awarded to people "who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind" in the previous 12 months.• They are awarded annually from a fund that Alfred Nobel(Swedish inventor and entrepreneur) set aside in his 1895 will for this purpose. o Alfred Nobel’s own inventions include a blasting cap, dynamite, and smokeless gunpowder.• Categories: Instituted in 1901, Prizes were initially awarded in five categories: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace. A sixth award, the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was instituted in 1968 by the Royal Bank of Sweden and was first awarded in 1969.• What do the winners receive? The recipient of each prize receives three things:o A Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art;o A Nobel medal;o A cash prize of 10m Swedish krona (£836,000; $1.1m). They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money.• Who awards the prizes? The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Physics & Chemistry and the Nobel prize in Medicine is awarded by Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. • Prize winners are called laureates, to signify the laurel wreath given to victors of contests in ancient Greece. More than one, but no more than three, people can win each prize.91 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 7.2.1. THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS 2021Prize awarded for: Ground-breaking contributions to our understanding of complex physical systems.Awardees • One half of the prize was awarded to Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann for their work in the physical modeling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming.• Second half was awarded to Giorgio Parisi for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales.About complex physical systems and the work of Nobel laurates• Complex systems are characterised by randomness and disorder and are difficult to understand. They can be difficult to describe mathematically – they may have an enormous number of components or be governed by chance. The Prize recognises new methods for describing them and predicting their long-term behaviour. The Earth’s climate is one of many examples of complex systems. • Syukuro Manabe demonstrated how increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to increased temperatures at the surface of the Earth.• Giorgio Parisi discovered hidden patterns in disordered complex materials with his spin glass experiments (refer infographic). With this, he discovered hidden structures within the systems and represented them mathematically. Implications of the work • Climate change models: In the 1960s, the development of physical models of the Earth’s climate laid the foundation for the development of current climate models. • Mathematical representation of random phenomenon: These discoveries make it possible to understand and describe many different and apparently entirely random materials and phenomena, in physics and in other areas, like mathematics, biology, neuroscience and machine learning.• Development of the theory of complex systems: His method has been used in many disordered systems and become a cornerstone of the theory of complex systems.7.2.2. NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSIOLOGY OR MEDICINEPrize awarded for: discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch. AwardeesThe 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was jointly awarded to David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian. About the receptors and work of Nobel laurates• In the human body, all the molecules are not sensitive to heat or mechanical pressure. Only very specific are, and it is their job to relay this signal to the nervous system, which then triggers an appropriate response.• David Julius utilized capsaicin, a pungent compound from chili peppers that induces a burning sensation, to identify a sensor in the nerve endings of the skin that responds to heat. • He and his team looked for a gene that could induce a response to capsaicin in cells that usually wouldn’t react to it. They found one in a novel ion channel protein, later called TRPV1, where TRP stands for transient receptor potential, and VR1 is vanilloid receptor1. 92 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS o They were part of a super family of TRP, and it was found that TRPV1 was activated when temperatures were greater than 40 degrees Celsius, which is close to the body’s pain threshold.• Ardem Patapoutian used pressure  sensitive cells to discover a novel classof sensors that respond to mechanical stimuli in the skin and internal organs.• Patapoutian and his colleagues identified 72 potential genes that could encode an ion channel receptor and trigger sensitivity to mechanical force, and it emerged that one of them coded for a novel ion channel protein, called Piezo1. o Via Piezo1, a second gene was discovered and named Piezo2. Sensory neurons were found to express high levels of Piezo2 and further studies firmly established that Piezo1 and Piezo2 are ion channels that are directly activated by the exertion of pressure on cell membranes.o Later it was demonstrated that the Piezo2 ion channel is essential for the sense of touch. Moreover, Piezo2 was shown to play a key role in proprioception as well as regulate blood pressure, respiration, and urinary bladdercontrol.• Both David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian also identified another new receptor called TRPM8, a receptor that is activated by cold.Applications of these discoveries:• Treatment of diseases: The knowledge (of the TRPV1, TRPM8 and Piezo channels) is being used to develop treatments for a wide range of disease conditions, including chronic pain.• Molecular structure of sensors: Along with the discoveries of specific genes, proteins and pathways, the scientists pioneered experimental methods that allow insight into the structure of these pain and temperature sensors. • Increasing precision of drugs: The challenge for pain relieving drugs is to precisely target regions without causing imbalance in other necessary functions. These scientists’ work significantly helped towards reaching that goal.7.2.3. NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRYPrize awarded for: development of a precise new tool for molecular construction: organocatalysis. AwardeesThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021 was awarded to Benjamin List and David MacMillan.About Catalysts, catalysis and organocatalysis and the work of Nobel laurates• Catalysts are substances that control and accelerate chemical reactions, without becoming part of the final product. o For example, catalysts in catalytic converters of cars transform toxic substances in exhaust fumes to harmless molecules.93 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Researchers long believed that there were, in principle, just two types of catalysts available: metals, mainly heavier metals; and enzymes, naturally occurring heavy molecules that facilitate all life-supporting biochemical processes. Both these had limitations:o Heavier metals are expensive and toxic to humans and the environment. Also, metals required an environment free of water and oxygen, which was difficult to ensure on an industrial scale.o Enzymes on the other hand, work best when water is used as a medium for the chemical reaction. But that is not an environment suitable for all kinds of chemical reactions.• Benjamin List and David MacMillan, independent of each other, developed a third type of catalysis. It is called asymmetric organocatalysis and builds upon small organic molecules.Significance of these discoveries:• Eco-Friendly: Organic catalysts have a stable framework of carbon atoms and often contain common elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur or phosphorus. Thus these catalysts are both environmentally friendly and cheap to produce.• Efficient: Organic catalysts can be used to drive multitudes of chemical reactions. Using these reactions, researchers can now more efficiently construct anything from new pharmaceuticals to molecules that can capture light in solar cells.• Economic benefits: Catalysts help in production of varied products like pharmaceuticals, plastics, perfumes and food flavourings. It is estimated that 35 per cent of the world’s total GDP in some way involves chemical catalysis.Asymmetric CatalysisDuring chemical construction a situation often arises in which two molecules can form, which –just like our hands – are each other’s mirror image. Chemists often just want one of these mirror images, particularly when producing pharmaceuticals, but it has been difficult to find efficient methods for doing this.• List and MacMillan discovered that by using a natural compound like an amino acid as a catalyst, they were obtaining only one specific mirror image of the end-product. This was later named asymmetric catalysis.• They experimented with simple organic compounds. Organic compounds are mostly naturally-occurring substances, built around a framework of carbon atoms and usually containing hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, or phosphorus.o Life-supporting chemicals like proteins, which are long chains of amino acids (carbon compounds containing nitrogen and oxygen) are organic.94 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS 7.4.

ETHICS9.1. FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON SOCIAL MEDIA: UNDERSTANDING THE REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS IN THE VIRTUAL WORLDIntroduction ‘Social media creating virus of lies, says Nobel Prize winner Maria Ressa’, ‘As Indians turn to social media for COVID-19 help, online resources for smaller cities begin to grow’, ‘Don't believe in fake videos of Tirumala floods on social media: TTD’. These headlines highlight a paradoxical picture of how expression on social media acts as an enabler but at the same time acts as a conduit for abuse of freedom of speech. What is freedom of speech and expression and how it manifests on social media? Freedom of speech and expression can be broadly understood as the belief that every person has the natural right to freely express themselves through any media and frontier without outside interference, such as censorship, and without fear of reprisal, such as threats and persecutions. In the Indian context, Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution of India confers on the citizens of India the right “to freedom of speech and expression”. This freedom can be expressed by speech, writing, printing, pictures, or any other expression. The same translates to social media through-• Free sharing of information: Content can be shared on social media in the form of ‘posts’, ‘tweets’, ‘stories’ among other forms of expression. This enables the individual to express their feelings, issues, and problems. E.g., Use of rainbow profile filters on Facebook by LGBRQIA+ community. • Expression of opinion: Social media platforms encourage opinion formation and expression of opinion through features like ‘comment’, ‘like’ etc. Such form of communication fuels expression by making it interactive, motivating and acting as a feedback loop. • Building connections and conversations: Social networking services can help people connect. The nature of social media enables people to express themselves to a newer and larger audience. E.g., Social media has become a networking and marketing pathway for several start-ups. • Seeking and receiving information: Information is also shared among the users passively though ‘news feed’, ‘following’ option among others. E.g., Election commission of India conveys information through Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme on social media. • Group expression: It facilitates formation of groups, their interaction, and their collective expression. E.g., UN Women’s #HeForShe drew solidarity from all corners of the world taking forward a group sentiment. Prevalence of these forms of communication gives another dimension to free speech. But there have been some unintended consequences with growing usage of social media. What are the issues that have arisen due to abuse of this right on social media platforms? The characteristics of social media i.e., sense of anonymity and wider reach combined with misuse of freedom of speech has led to following issues-• Misinformation: For example, spread misinformation about important matters such as COVID-19 and vaccines. • Internet trolling and inflammatory content: Internet trolling can be understood as a malicious online behavior, characterized by aggressive and deliberate provocation of others. “Trolls” seek to provoke, upset, and harm othersvia inflammatory messages and posts.o For example, several instances of mob lynching have their source in inflammatory rumors spread by anti-social actors. • Defamatory or hateful content: The perception that there are ‘no consequences’ for what you say on social media encourages anti-social elements make false, hurtful and hateful comments in relation to people, religion, interests, nationalities among others. 99 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Unethical use by powerful actors: Being a commercial entity, social media can be at times used in a deceitful manner by powerful actors such as large corporations, political parties etc. For example, the tool of fake news was allegedly used by actors in the US elections of 2016. o Paid content on social media such as fake followers, planted reviews etc. also misguide the user. • Severe expression of already prevalent societal fault lines: The issues such as racism, casteism, communalism or regionalism among others tend to get expressed in a more aggravated form. How do these issues affect the society and people? • Element of trust: Increasing instances of misuse of social media and poor behavior on social media would remove the element of trust from the given ecosystem. • Discourages empathetic behavior: Aforementioned activities create a culture of insensitivity and indifference on social media. • Creates an atmosphere akin to bullying: Poor experiences on social media in terms of hurtful comments, unwelcoming atmosphere would make social media an unsafe space especially for vulnerable and impressionable participants. • Affecting Mental health: Social acceptance is a psychological need of the human mind. Being a victim of online trolling creates a perception of non-acceptance by one’s peers. This can drastically affect a person’s self-esteem and mental health. The misuse of freedom on social media demands reasonable restriction on freedom of speech on social media. What are the reasonable restrictions to freedom of speech and expression and how are they applied on social media? The freedom of speech and expression does not confer on the citizens the right to speak or publish without responsibility. As per Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India, the legislature may enact laws to impose restrictions on the right to speech and expression on the following grounds:Sovereignty and integrity of IndiaSecurity of the State Friendly relations with foreign States Incitement to an offenceDefamation Contempt of court Decency or morality Public orderThe same grounds apply to restricting freedom of speech and expression on social media. To enforce these restrictions, following tools have been used-• Source-selective censorship: Several websites, applications or groups which engage in activities which go beyond the purview of freedom of expression are banned from online platforms. For example, banning of several pornographic websites. • Content-selective censorship: Content of sensitive nature which has the potential to disturb public order or go into the above-mentioned restricted areas is identified and removed from online platforms. For example, removal of communally charged posts or videos. • Platform-controlled Censorship: Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube routinely remove posts deemed to violate standards on violence, sexual content, privacy, harassment, impersonation, self-harm, and other concerns. • Temporary bans: In certain situations, a platform or overall social media is subjected to a temporary ban in the light of a security threat, public order etc. For instance, in 2015, the Bangladesh government blocked six social media sites namely Facebook, WhatsApp, Line, Messenger, Tango and Viber due to a potential security threat. • Penalization: Commission of offences like defamatory remarks or inciting of violence via social media mode gets requisite punishment. The legal route adopted for enforcing this punishment is via the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology Rules, 2021. Limitations of the current framework• Subjective: The IT Act contains a lot of subjective terms like “grossly offensive” or “causing annoyance”, which instills fear and uncertainty in the users. This was highlighted in the Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India case. o According to a survey, 83% of people said that owing to past arrests made in the country, they think twice before posting anything on social media networks.100 www.visionias.in ©Vision IAS • Imposed not voluntary: The regulatory methods under which social media operates are imposed upon the users and are not voluntary in nature. • Jurisdiction issues: Most of the major social media platforms are multi-national companies, which creates ambiguity in adherence to national laws. For example, blasphemy is a crime in Saudi Arabia but not so in United States or Australia. • Lack of clarity on expectations from the users: There is no normative code of conduct or role clarity on what users are supposed to do or should they behave on these platforms. Where should the buck stop?: Creating an ethics of communication for social mediaBalancing freedom of speech and expression and effective enforcement of reasonable restrictions cannot be an ad-hoc and unilateral approach. To ensure that the communication on social media is ethical, it is important principled approach (refer infographics) towards its regulation. At the same time, these principles are to be adopted in a multi  stakeholder manner. In the light of these principles, all the stakeholders have the responsibility to make social media more ethical-• Users: Users have the responsibility adhere to these communication principles so as to make social media interaction safe, purposeful and constructive for everybody. o This includes exhibiting tolerance, maintaining decency, responsible sharing of content and practicing social media hygieneby ignoring hurtful and hateful content. • Platforms: Platforms have the duty to incorporate these principles in the design architecture of the platform itself. o This implies encouraging responsible, truthful, and respectful expression from its users. o Also, clarity on accountability of content, adoption of a democratic approach to post-censorship and protecting the privacy of its users need to be a part of the platform structure. • Government Authorities: Governmental authorities play a vital role in ensuring that the platforms are abiding by these principles and at the same time providing them legal and institutional support to fulfill this role effectively. o This would entail streamlining the legal and regulatory framework in the line of these principles and ensuring that the regulations are largely voluntary, multi-party and as objective as possible. ConclusionFreedom of speech and expression on social media like on other traditional media will organically grow only when the nature of communication is governed by moral and ethical principles and not by law.
