This era is the last in the classification.
It started about 65 million years ago.
The cenozoic era is made up of two periods: The tertiary period and the Quaternary period.
The Tertiary period contains the following five epochs: Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene.
The Quaternary period can be divided into two epochs: Pleistocene and Holocene. Hence, Statement 5 is not correct.
The main developments of this era include the formation of the Rockies, Himalayas, and the Alps, Australia splitting away from Antarctica, India colliding with Asia.
The current time can be put into the Cenozoic Era, Quaternary period and Holocene Epoch.
