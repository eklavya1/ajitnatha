arid soils range from red to brown in colour.
they are generally sandy in structure & saline in nature.
in some areas, salt content is so high that common salt is obtained by evaporating saline water.
due to dry climate, high temperature & accelerated evaporation, they lack moisture & humus.
nitrogen is insufficient & phosphate content is normal.
lower horizons of soil are occupied by 'kankar' layers  b/c of increasing calcium content downwards.
