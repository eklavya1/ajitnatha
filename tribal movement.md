**Imposition of Land revenue Settlement -**
Expansion of agriculture by the non-tribals to the tribal area or over forest coverlet to the erosion of tribal traditions of joint ownership and increased the socio-economic differentiation in the egalitarian structure of the tribal society.
**Work of Christian Missionaries -**
The work of Christian Missionaries brought about further changes in the socio-economic and cultural equation of the tribals and the mainstream society plus in turbulent times, the tendency of the missionaries to refuse to take up arms or in discouraging people from rising against the government made the missionaries to be viewed as an extension of colonialism and were often attacked by the rebels.
**Increasing demand for goods from the early nineteenth century -**
First for the royal navy and then railways, which led to increasing control of the government over forest land.
**Implementation of Various Act**
The establishment of the Forest department in 1864, the Government Forest Act(1865), and the Indian Forest Act in 1878 together established complete government monopoly over Indian forest land.
Shifting Agriculture, a widespread practice amongst the various tribal communities was banned from 1864 onwards on the reserved forest.
Restrictions were imposed on the previously sanctioned timber and grazing facilities.
The extension of settled agriculture led to the influx of non-tribals in the tribal areas.
These outsiders exploited them and the extension of settled agriculture led to the loss of land by the tribals which reduced them to agricultural laborers.
**Reaction against landlords, and Outsiders**
Some of the tribal uprisings took place in reaction to the effect of the landlords to impose taxes on the customary use of timber and grazing facilities, police exaction, new excise regulations, exploitation by low country traders and money lenders, and restrictions on shifting cultivation in the forest.
The rebellions by the non-frontier tribals were usually reactions against outsiders (dikus), local landlords, and rulers, the support provided to the latter by the British administration, and intervention by them in the life of the tribals.
The indigenous names for these tribal movements wereMeIi, Hool and UI-GuIan.
Introduction of the notion of private property-Land could be bought, sold, mortgaged which led to the loss of land by the tribals.
