radioactivity is phenomenon of spontaneous emission of particles or waves from unstable nuclei of some elements. there are 3 types of radioactive emissions: alpha, beta, & gamma-
a small amount of radiation is found in all types of water but extended amount of radiation is harmful to human health- radioactivity in drinking water can be determined by a gross alpha test

**sources**
## natural:
• radiotoxic elements in aquatic system: radium, a descendant of norm series, is 1 of radiotoxic elements found in aquatic systems & can be penetrated into groundwater
• aquifer rock dissolution
• decaying of 2380 & 232 th
• desorption processes.
• radium is a radionuclide formed by decay of uranium (u) & thorium (th) in environment
• magma: sometimes, magma also releases radioactive gases into environment. hence, 4 is correct.
• soil sediments: percolation of norm from soil sediments to aquifer causes groundwater contamination. hence, 2 is correct.

## anthropogenic
nuclear reactors & warheads:
• nuclear reactors & nuclear warhead experiments are key sources of human-induced radionuclides discharge. hence, 1 is correct
• nuclear reactors produce radioisotopes (cobalt-60, iridium-192, etc) that hand out as sources of gamma radiation in radiotherapy & numerous industrial appliances.
o dumping of radioactive waste:
• application of radioactive elements in nuclear weapons, x-rays, mr', & other medical equipment causes their exposure to human beings. dumping of these radioactive wastes in surface water bodies causes water pollution. hence, 3 is correct.

	- radioactivity- it's a natural emission of high energy radiations or nuclei from unstable elements or isotopes due to disintegration of their atomic nuclei.
	- phenomenon of radioactivity was discovered by _becquerel_
	- radioactivity is further characterized by 3 diff- 
		 - alpha decay - helium nucleus- helium nucleus comes out of parent nucleus. happens in a bigger nucleus. ex- uranium
		 - beta-decay - electron- electron comes out of parent nucleus. generally happens in isotopes. ex- carbon 14. its types- beta plus decay & beta minus decay
		 - beta plus decay- when a proton is converted into a neutron.
		 - beta minus decay - when a neutron is converted to a proton.
		 - gamma decay - gamma radiation - gamma radiation comes out of parent nucleus. it happens naturally. ex-barium
