The history of our species is the story of little errors and other changes that kept popping up in the reproduction process. — location: [91]()

We have a strong attraction to what we feel is natural, but our species is defined by our relentless efforts to tame nature. — location: [262]()

Our nomadic hunter-gatherer ancestors, for example, began noticing that some of the wolves picking through their garbage were friendlier than others. Starting around fifteen thousand years ago, probably in Central Asia, they started breeding those friendlier wolves with each other, eventually creating dogs. — location: [396]()

The ancient Chinese game of Go, considered by many the world’s most complicated board game, has long played a central role in China’s culture and strategic thinking. Invented more than 2,500 years ago, the Go board is made up of 361 squares onto which one player places black stones and the other white. Moving in turn, each player tries to encircle the other player’s stones to take them off the board. Whoever controls the most territory when the game ends is the winner. — location: [823]()

Today, however, most of our species is networked through the [[internet]]; we can glide past problems others have already solved and focus on the new challenges we ourselves are best able to address. — location: [851]()

When brilliant people like Edison died, much of their knowledge went with them to the grave. Today, far more of our information and knowledge is captured in our accessible digital records, and the data processing and knowledge-amassing tools we are developing will live in perpetuity. Human death remains an individual and familial tragedy (and just generally sucks), but it has far less impact on the advance of our collective knowledge and our species more generally than it used to. — location: [853]()

From the moment life emerged, our ancestors entered a never-ending arms race with each other and other species for advantage and survival. — location: [3877]()

In our nomadic, hunter-gatherer days, human groups in many places competed relentlessly with each other, often stealing each other’s resources. When the advent of agriculture, writing, and other technologies made it possible to organize ourselves into larger communities, we wasted no time translating each little technological advantage into individual and collective opportunities to rob, subjugate, and oppress each other. — location: [3879]()

genetic arms race. An agreement would need to neither offend the sensibilities of powerful constituencies deeply uncomfortable with the concept of human germline engineering nor impede the development of new generations of knowledge and its application on which trillions of dollars of commerce; the competitiveness of individuals, companies, and countries; and the well-being of [[future]] generations depends. Within these narrow bounds, any — location: [4545]()

how can each of us be better engaged in this process? After these issues are framed by the expert commission, easily understood multimedia background materials could be created for each question that could be a foundation for an extensive and ongoing series of dialogues to be held around the world. A global coalition of partner universities, school systems, think tanks, religious organizations, and civil society groups could then organize these dialogues — location: [4634]()

Early Western theologians referenced the Old Testament to justify human domination of nature. “Let us make man in our image,” god says in Genesis 1:26, “and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.” — location: [3386]()

Mao launched the Great Leap Forward in 1958. To build an agricultural surplus to support industrialization, peasant farmers were forced into communes and told to plant up to ten times more seeds in their fields than they had previously done. The crops died from over-density. Because sparrows were eating some of the crops that remained, Mao and party leaders called on children to search out and destroy sparrow nests and on farmers to bang pots and pans together to drive the sparrows to exhaustion. After millions of sparrows were killed, the insect populations predictably exploded, further devastating agricultural yields. — location: [3404]()
