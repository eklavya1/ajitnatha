The Centre approved the scheme for 'grant of ex-gratia payment of the difference between compound and simple interest to borrowers of specified loan accounts' from March 1 - August 31.
The 'ex-gratia payment' or the benefit will have to be routed through lending institutions.
The government would reimburse the claim amount to the lenders.
The benefit will be extended for loans availed across eight categories: micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), education, housing, consumer durables, credit card dues, automobile, personal and professional and consumption.
The scheme is valid for borrowers who availed the moratorium fully, partially or not at all, as mentioned in the circular.
