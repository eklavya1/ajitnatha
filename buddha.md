do not believe in anything (simply)
because you have heard it.
do not believe in traditions because they
have been handed down for many generations.
do not believe in anything because it is
spoken & rumoured by many.
do not believe in anything (simply) because
it is found written in your religious books.
do not believe in anything merely on authority
of your teachers & elders.
but after observation & analysis,
(üen you find anything that agrees with reason
and is conducive to good & benefit of one & all
then accept it & live up to it. ^e35a2e
