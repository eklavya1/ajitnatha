# summary	

thermohaline circulation

    deep ocean currents driven by difference in water density which is controlled by temperature & salinity is c/a thermohaline circulation.
    it begins near polar regions where ice forms leaving water saltier & denser leading to sinking.
    deepwater upwells in region of cold current upwelling.
    this underwater current moves slowly in a single & continuous belt across diff oceans.
    therefore these are also c/a great ocean conveyor current.

water mass

    it's a body of water with characteristic temperature & salinity conditions.
    types of water mass:
    surface water mass (exs antarctica surface water mass)
    intermediate water mass 
    deepwater mass (north atlantic deep water mass; circumpolar deepwater mass)
    significance of water mass:
    they help in generation & maintenance of thermohaline circulation.
    they help in distribution of oxygen, salinity, temperature across oceans.
    they help in generation of upwelling & downwelling.
    they help in growth of planktons.

walker circulation:

    in normal conditions:
    near south american coast, winds blow offshore & blows surface water away from continents.
    to replace this water, cool bottom water upwells.
    air above this cool water is stabilized & convection is suppressed.
    water flows westward as se trade winds blow towards western pacific region.
    it's heated & rises & flows eastward in upper troposphere & descends down along eastern pacific ocean to complete cell.
    resulting convective cell is c/a walker circulation.
    in normal condition, eastern pacific coast experiences drought.
    western pacific ocean experiences good rainfall.
    in el nino conditions:
    it occurs once in around 7 to 8 years.
    in this phenomenon, subsequent reduction of upwelling along south american coast causes warming of surface water of south & central america.
    appearance of el nino causes air pressure to drop over east pacific region & rise over western pacific.
    this see-saw variation pressure is c/a el nino southern oscillation (enso).
    this causes heavy precipitation along eastern pacific region.
    after 1 or 2 years, enhanced hadley circulation strengthens trade winds & increases upwelling & bringing back normal condition.
    elnino is followed by la nina
    in la nina conditions:
    it's intensified high pressure & low temperature along eastern pacific with low pressure & high temperature along western pacific ocean region.
    intensification of walker circulation causes heavy precipitation in india & australia.
    effects of el nino
    it causes global climatic imbalances.
    it results in droughts in india & australia.
    it results in heavy precipitation along coastal desert of peru & chile.
    warm water inhibits growth of algae & suppresses upwelling.
    this devastates marine ecosystem, killing fishes along with peruvian current.
    decomposition of dead fishes releases hydrogen sulfide which makes water toxic & dark in color.
    during el nino condition, high pressure near india, australia, & caribbean sea, suppresses cyclone formation.
    el nino modoki
    while el nino is characterized by strong warming in eastern pacific ocean,
    el nino modoki, on other hand, results in warming in central pacific ocean with cooling of eastern & western parts.
    it creates two-cell water circulation over tropical pacific region with precipitation in central part & dry conditions in eastern & western parts.
    el nino modoki results in increased incidents of hurricanes in caribbean sea  (unlike el nino)
    during this time, cyclones occur more in arabian sea than in bob.

madden julian oscillation (mjo)

    these are eastward-moving circulations of clouds, winds, pressure, & rainfall.
    they traverse planet in tropics & return to their initial starting point in 30 to 60 days, on average.

indian ocean dipole (iod)

    positive iod is good for indian monsoon.
    note: mjo & iod can decrease/ enhance el nino effect depending upon its types & characteristics
    ex for this :
    convective cell of mjo & positive iod can bring heavy precipitation despite year being el nino year

next class: dictation on iod & mjo; tides, biogeography & indian geography
