- Article 123 _[[a123 Power of President to promulgate Ordinances during recess of Parliament]]_ of the Indian constitution for president and article 213 _[[a213]]_ for governor of states.

- Article 123 of the Indian constitution:
- In chapter 3 of part 5 of the constitution, deal with the legislative power of the president.
- It deals with the power of the president to promulgate ordinances during recess of the parliament.
- This power can be used when only one house of the parliament is in session or none of the houses is in session.
- It can be used to deal with an emergency situation.

- This power of ordinance making is to be exercised on the aid and advice of the council of ministers.
- Article 123(2): the ordinance has the same effect and force as the law of the parliament.
	- The ordinance has the same effect as the law of the parliament.
	- The ordinance-making power cannot be exercised to amend the constitution as these powers are only for dealing with the emergency situation only.

## Safeguards against the issue of an ordinance making power:
- constitutional safeguards:
	- The ordinance has to be approved within the 6 weeks of the resemble of both the house of parliament otherwise the ordinance would lapse.
	- The 6 weeks time is counted from the moment both houses come into session.
	- The parliament also has the power to disapprove the ordinance through a resolution ([[simple majority]]) within 6 week's time.
	- The president can also revoke the ordinance at any point in time.
	- The [[judicial review]] of the ordinance is possible.

Parliamentary convention: when the ordinance is placed in front of tr parliament, the executive accompanies it with a statement of reasons.

[[D.C Wadhwa Vs sate of Bihar case]]:
- The [[bihar]] governments promulgated 256 ordinances and re-promulgated the ordinances 13 times.
- The supreme court said that there-promulgated of an ordinance to prevent the scrutiny of the legislature is fraud in the constitution. 
- Judicial review of an ordinance making power of executive:
	- An act of ordinance by the president or governor is within the same restrictions which are placed on the parliament with respect to any law.
	- Therefore the supreme court of India has held that the ordinance-making power of the president and governor is not immune from judicial review just like a parliamentary law.
	- The court has further held In [[RC cooper Vs UOI,1970]] that the president's decision the promulgate an ordinance can be challenged on the ground that immediate action was not required and the ordinance was issued primarily to by-pass the discussion and debate in the legislature.
	- The same ordinance-making power is available to the governor under _[[a213]]_ of the Indian [[constitution]].
