## AZE2
plant-based chewing gum that 'traps' coronavirus.
enzyme molecule that connects inside of our cells to outside via cell membrane.
in normal physiology, another enzyme c/a ace alters a chemical, angiotensin l, & converts it into angiotensin ii, which causes blood vessels to constrict. tightening of blood vessels leads to increase in blood pressure.
that's when ace2 molecule comes in to counteract effects of ace, causing blood vessels to dilate & lowering blood pressure.
spikes that make up 'crown' of coronavirus bind to ace2 enzymes to get into our cells
