Farrukhsiyar, (Persian pronunciation: [farʊx'sɪjar]) also known as Shahid-i-Mazlum (20 August 1683 – 9 April 1719), was the tenth Mughal emperor from 1713 to 1719, after he assassinated his Uncle and Emperor, Jahandar Shah. *Reportedly a handsome man who was easily swayed by his advisers, he lacked the ability, knowledge and character to rule independently.* Farrukhsiyar was the son of Azim-ush-Shan (the second son of emperor Bahadur Shah I) and Sahiba Nizwan. He *was assassinated by Ajit Singh of Marwar*.
