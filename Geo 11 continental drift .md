# continental drift theory
(01:39 pm).
- continental drift theory was proposed by german meteorologists to explain major variations in earth's climate.
- cause for such variations can be- 
- continents remained stationary, while climatic zones changed.
- climatic zones remained stationary & continental land might have displaced.
- as wegner did not find any evidence of changes in climatic zones, he proposed continental drift as reason.
- assumptions:
- he proposed 3 layers of earth with outer sial, intermediate sima, & inner nife. sial was continental mass, whereas, oceanic crust was sima. 
- sial masses were assumed to be floating on sima without any resistance.
# theory
250 mya, there was only 1 supercontinent c/a pangea & 1 superocean panthalassa.
panagea consisted of all present continents merged together. this supercontinent started to split during carboniferous period into angaraland/laurasia (north ) & gondwanaland (south).
northern portion i.e. angaraland consisted of north america, greenland, & eurasia without india & arabia.
gondwanaland consisted of africa with arabia, south america, india, australia, & antarctica.
gradually, a north-south rift separated north america from eurasia & south america from africa, which started to move towards west.
india started moving towards north, australia got separated from antarctica & moved towards north-east. around 20 mya, arabia got separated from africa & merged into asia.
# forces
forces suggested by alfred wegner as cause of continental motion-
equatorward or north-south movement caused by pole-fleeing force due to gravitational diffial force & force of buoyancy to adjust center of gravity & center of buoyancy.
westward movement caused by tidal forces of sun & moon.
# evidence
justafix of continents i.e. similarities in continents on opposite sides of oceans.
structural evidence- mountain belts of brazil terminates on south american east coast & same type of mountains reappeared again in africa.
stratigraphic evidence- eastern coast of brazil has same type of rock formations observed in western africa.
fossil evidence- mesasaurus, aquatic reptile whose fossil remains are found only in eastern south america & south africa. had it been able to swim across vast ocean, it should have been widely distributed. fossils of glossopteeris, a fern grown only in subpolar climate are now found in warm climatic regions separated by wide oceans.
glacial deposits- layers of tillites are found in warm tropical regions like south america, africa, australia, & india.
placer deposits- rich deposits of gold near western africa without any source of gold nearby but they are found in brazilian plateau.
# criticisms
rocks of continental crust & oceanic crust are very rigid & would not permit a smooth drifting of continents over oceanic floor.
geophysical mechanic envisaged for movement of continents i.e. forces suggested are inadequate.
theory did not describe situations of pre-carboniferous times.

# seafloor spreading theory
(03:07 pm).

mapping of oceanic floor revealed foll important characteristics of oceanic floor-
presence of mid-oceanic ridges (mor).
these ridges are active i.e. continuous volcanic eruptions happening over there.
rocks of oceanic floor are of same age, same composition, & similar magnetic properties on both sides of ridge.
age of rocks along oceanic floor increases away from ridge.
age of oceanic basin is lesser than that of continents.
oceanic crust is thinner than continental crust.
based on above evidence, harry hess in 1961, proposed theory of seafloor spreading, acc to which-
constant magnetic eruptions at oceanic ridges cause rupture of oceanic crust & new lava wedges onto oceanic crust.
this pushes oceanic crust on either side of ridge & therefore, oceanic floor spreads.
spreading crust sinks down at oceanic trench & gets consumed.

# mapping
(03:39 pm).

# asia:
west asia, south asia, south-east asia, east asia, siberia, central asia.
central asia:
made up of 5 countries- kazakhstan, uzbekistan, kyrgyzstan, turkmenistan, tajikistan.
uzbekistan has no access to world ocean directly- a doubly landlocked country.
5 capitals- astana/ nur sultan (kazakhstan), tashkent (uzbekistan), bishkek (kyrgyzstan), ashgabat (turkmenistan), dushanbe (tajikistan).
bishkek declaration on snow leopard, 2013.
ashgabat agreement= international transport & transit corridor agreement.

topic for next class= plate tectonics theory.
