These paintings were patronised by the rulers of the Mysore province and continued in the British period too.
The major theme of the Mysore paintings is the depiction of Hindu Gods and Goddesses.
The unique part of these paintings is that they had two or more figures in each painting and one figure was predominant in all the others in size and colour.
Furthermore, even the technique of making this painting is very different from the North Indian styles.
• They use the gesso paste which is a mixture of zinc oxide and Arabic gum.
• This gives a particular base to the painting that develops the sheen on the background.
They counter it with the use of muted colours that are not so bright as so as to counter at the background.
