## issues with urban governance in india
issues with urban governance in india (10:05:00 am)

financial paucity: chief sources of income for urban local bodies are varied types of taxes, most of which are levied by union & state govts and, taxes collected by urban bodies are not sufficient to cover expenses of services provided.
30% of tax revenue comes from property tax that is far lesser than world standard that is around 60%, due to so many exemptions provided, lack of land entitlements, & poor administration in collection of property tax.
corruption: administrative machinery, at disposal of these local bodies is insufficient & ineffective. staff which is often underpaid indulges in corrupt practices which lead to loss of income.
excessive state control over municipalities: state govts have power to supersede & dissolve municipal bodies under certain circumstances.
further, state govts have powers like:
they approve municipal budget (except that of a corporation).
even modified local tax structure needs govt’s prior approval & later ratification.
control through accounting & audit system, etc.
unplanned urbanization: municipal services have failed to cope with increasing needs of population, both qualitatively & quantitatively.
multiplicity of agencies: usually works are not well allocated among diff agencies which causes overlap of authority & responsibility. this further leads to diffused accountability.
ex of jal board in many of cities created by state legislature as separate body. jal board is administered by appointed members.
dilution of efforts: due to multiple layers of planning, administration, & resource allocation to tackle deprivations, efforts are often dispersed in time & space, leading to suboptimal results.
these urban local bodies are headed by bureaucrats: single-purpose agencies are all dominated by bureaucrats, which goes against basic philosophy of local govt.
people’s representatives have a secondary role to play.
substandard personnel: urban govt increasingly needs professional services of experts.
land titling in urban areas: a study has reported that most, over 90% by 1 estimate, of land titles in india are ‘unclear’, & land market distortions & unclear land titles cost india around 1.3% of gross domestic product.
low level of people’s participation: people’s apathy towards participating in governance system pushes such institutions into a state of complacency & irresponsibility.
ecological challenges: growth of population & industries presents unprecedented challenge of ecological degradation & pollution of water, air, & land.

## problems of grassroots planning bodies
problems of grassroots planning bodies

delay in setting up of district planning committees (dpc).
they don’t exist in states. even if exist then only on paper
no appointment of experts.
state-level cabinet ministers are chairpersons in many states. it defeats purpose of grassroots planning itself.
no fiscal decentralization, which makes planning exercise useless in nature
rural & urban linkages are not achieved on this matter.
district planning committees (dpcs) have been envisaged as a vital link in process of bottom-up planning. in this context, highlight factors that are hampering bottom-up planning process through dpcs. what measures can be taken to strengthen dpcs?  (250 words/15 marks)
various reasons that are hampering bottom-up planning process through dpcs are:
devolution report, 2015, published by ministry of panchayati raj says that several states have not constituted dpcs despite constitutional mandate.
even in states, dpcs are established, their autonomy & functioning are hampered by interference by state govts. few states like chhattisgarh, gujarat, punjab, etc. have ministers as chairpersons of dpcs which severely hampers participative nature of planning process.
pcs are functioning regularly in a few states only but with a lack of efficiency & capacity in terms of funds, expertise to sort out issues & deliver on time
in almost all states parallel bodies encroach on functional domain of dpcs.
inability of dpcs to consolidate plans of village panchayats into district perspective plans.
absence of powerful & politically accountable leadership in cities is considered as 1 of primary reasons for urban woes. do you think that direct election of mayor can help in overcoming this issue? what other alternatives can be explored for improving working of urban local bodies?

## position of mayor
position of mayor

constitution provides discretion to states in manner of election – direct or indirect of mayor. thus, in most states, mayors are appointed indirectly & not through direct elections.
mayor has been reduced to a figurehead while most powers reside with municipal commissioner appointed by state govt.

## necessity of direct elections
necessity of direct elections

direct elections of mayors will help to address these lacunae in foll ways:
responsiveness of a directly elected mayor will be greater than that of indirectly elected.
it will strengthen grass-root democracy.
direct elections combined with greater executive & financial powers to mayor will improve his performance.
since mayor is directly elected he can be held accountable by people.
mayor will be more attuned with problems of people.
it will reduce interference of local mps/mlas in municipal functioning.
however, it's also fraught with certain issues & this system has not been too encouraging in some states like tamil nadu, which are reverting to indirect elections. this is because of foll reasons:
fewer powers:  not only direct elections but devolving financial & executive powers municipalities is also needed which states are reluctant to do.
political deadlock:  if mayor is of a diff political party & majority of council members are from diff parties then it leads to a deadlock in decision making, which is often case.
due to party system, mayors are still more inclined towards party than being accountable to people.

## schedule v & schedule vi areas
schedule v & schedule vi areas(10:56:00 am)

president of india in consultation with govt of state may declare any area as schedule area under which schedule v will be applied.

criteria on which state is supposed to decide area as schedule area:

dominance of tribal population.
compactness of area.

challenges or issued associated with 5th scheduled
challenges or issued associated with 5th scheduled

in most states, tribal advisory councils have not been constituted. it defeats entire purpose of constitution vth schedule of indian constitution.
where tribal advisory councils has been constituted act as advisory body only.
governors in most of states have not utilized their powers to make regulation for good governance in these vth scheduled areas.
it has often has been seen that g failed to submit annual reports regarding governance of these vth scheduled areas.
tribal advisory councils do not have any support staff to help them in their functioning.
often relationship b/w governors & tac has been of lack of trust.

## schedule vi areas
schedule vi areas  (11:24:00 am)

provisions of schedule vi areas are applicable to areas under assam, meghalaya, tripura, & mizoram.
autonomous district councils are constituted under vith scheduled areas. autonomous district councils are popularly elected bodies. they are created to safeguard interest of tribals in areas.
powers: either district will be given as autonomous district or region can be given as autonomous region.
autonomous district councils has legislative powers to legislate laws on fisheries, money lending, various local customs & tradition of tribals, agriculture, public health,
autonomous district councils have been given financial power such as levy taxes & fees as well.
autonomous district councils in some areas have been given certain judicial functions as well.
act of parliament or state legislature may not apply or may apply with certain modifications in governance of vith scheduled area.

issues

vith schedule has created multiple power centres instead of bringing in a genuine process of providing autonomy in governance of region.
it's often noticed that conflict of interest arises b/w functioning of district councils & state legislatures.
for ex in meghalaya despite formation of state whole of state continues to be under vith schedule causing frequent conflicts with state govt.
granting sp. provisions to certain tribal groups has led to further demand by other groups, therefore, creating conflict b/w various ethnic groups.
autonomous district councils are often unable to perform their functions properly due to a lack of financial autonomy.
there exist a huge gap b/w approved budgets & funds received from state govt which has had a direct impact on function of these councils.
unlike 73rd & 74th caa, autonomous district councils do not have any constitution provisions related to reservation of women, therefore, affecting gender equality in these institutions.
there is a clear lack of interest on part of district councils in taking initiatives & monitoring developmental activities at micro-level.
vith schedule vest enormous power in governor of state where members of various atcs are opinion that governors are mere puppet in hands of ministers & do not allow autonomous functioning of councils.
