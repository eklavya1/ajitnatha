Lingayatism or Veera Saivism is a Hindu denomination based on Shaivism. Initially known as Veerashaivas, since the 12th-century adherents of this faith are known as Lingayats. The terms Lingayatism and Veerashaivism have been used synonymously, but Veerashaivism may refer to the broader Veerashaiva philosophy which predates Lingayatism, to the historical community now called Lingayats, and to a contemporary (sub)tradition within Lingayatism with Vedic influences.Veerashaiva Lingayatism was revived, by the 12th-century philosopher and statesman Basava in Karnataka. Lingayatism may refer to the whole Veerashaiva Lingayat community, but also to a contemporary sub-tradition dedicated to Basava's original thought, and to a movement within this community which strives toward recognition as an independent religion. Lingayat scholars thrived in northern Karnataka during the Vijayanagara Empire (14th-18th century). In the 21st century, some Lingayats have sought legal recognition as a religion distinct from Hinduism and Veerashaivas, a request which has gained political support from the Congress-led Karnataka government, but is opposed by others.Lingayatism is generally considered a Hindu sect because their beliefs include many Hindu elements. Worship is centered on Shiva as the universal god in the iconographic form of Ishtalinga. Lingayatism emphasizes qualified monism, with philosophical foundations similar to those of the 11thâ€“12th-century South Indian philosopher Ramanuja. *Lingayatism rejects any form of social discrimination including the caste system and authority of Vedas and Puranas (and rebirth)*.Contemporary Lingayatism is influential in South India, especially in the state of Karnataka. Lingayats celebrate anniversaries (jayanti) of major religious leaders of their sect, as well as Hindu festivals such as Shivaratri and Ganesh Chaturthi. Lingayatism has its own pilgrimage places, temples, shrines and religious poetry based on Shiva. Today, Lingayats, along with Shaiva Siddhanta followers, Naths, Pashupaths, Kapalikas and others constitute the Shaivite population.
