- in economics and consumer theory, a giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa—violating the basic law of demand in microeconomics. for any other sort of good, as the price of the good rises, the substitution effect makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of substitute goods; for most goods, the income effect (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the good. but a giffen good is so strongly an inferior good in the minds of consumers (being more in demand at lower incomes) that this contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect, and the net effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it. this phenomenon is known as the giffen paradox. a giffen good is considered to be the opposite of an ordinary good.
