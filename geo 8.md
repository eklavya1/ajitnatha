geography class 08

a brief revision of previous class

evolution of earth
geological time scale
direct & indirect sources of interior of earth

interior of earth

chemical divisions: crust, mantle, & core

crust

it's outermost layer & also lightest among all.
there are 2 types of crust: continental & oceanic.
differences b/w continental & oceanic crust:
continental 	oceanic
lighter (2.77gm/cm³) 	heavier (3 gm/cm³)
made of si & al (sial layer) 	si + ma (sima layer)
rocks are brighter in color 	darker in color
thicker (35-45 km) 	thinner (8-10 km)
older in age 	younger in age

mantle 

it's 2nd layer in earth's interior, which is heavier than crust but lighter than core.
it accounts for 83% of volume & 68% of mass of earth. 
depth of mantle: 2888 km.
2 parts: upper mantle & lower mantle.

core

it's innermost layer of earth's interior & heaviest in terms of density.
mainly made of nickle & iron-> nife layer.
density: 13 gm/cm³
2 divisions: outer core & inner core
outer core: liquid (pressure is a bit lower than inner core which results in lower melting point of rocks due to which there is a liquid layer in outer core).
inner core: solid

physical divisions: lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesosphere, barrysphere

lithosphere

it's outermost, solid layer made up of crust & upper part of upper mantle.
it's divided into diff plates. 
thickness of lithosphere is up to 100 km from surface.

asthenosphere

it's plastic & less viscous in nature.
depth: 100-400 km.
it's source of magma which is erupted on surface. 
it's also c/a a low-velocity zone due to slowing down of earthquake waves in this zone.

mesosphere

it includes rest of mantle.

barrysphere

it includes both outer & inner core. 

major elements of earth's crust

oxygen: 46.60%
silicon: 27.72%
aluminum: 8.13%
iron: 5%
calcium: 3.63%

elements in entire earth

iron: 35%
oxygen: 30%
silicon- 15%
magnesium: 13%

mapping exercise

importance of mapping
types of questions: 1. direct location-based 2.indirect but information type.
oceans- pacific, atlantic, indian, arctic, southern ocean. (as per international hydrographic organisation)-> location explained in class
continents- asia, africa, n.america, s.america, antarctica, europe, & oceania 

important locations

oceans

pacific ocean
bering strait: connects arctic ocean with pacific ocean
mariana trench: deepest part of earth (in pacific ocean); challenger deep: located in mariana trench
ring of fire: boundaries of pacific ocean
atlantic ocean
drake passage: connects atlantic & southern ocean (passage-> wide; strait-> narrow)
youngest ocean; s-shaped
mid-atlantic ridge: located in middle of atlantic ocean; longest chain of mountains.
indian ocean
only ocean named after a country 
boundaries: bounded by land in north-> not directly connected to arctic ocean
arctic ocean
smallest ocean
permanent frozen
arctic amplification: impact of global warming on arctic ocean 

continents

no fixed definition; they are major landmasses.
asia
ural mountains: boundary b/w europe & asia; is in russia. so russia is both in europe & asia. western russia is developed; eastern russia is cold-> siberia
sinai peninsula: connects asia & africa.
new guinea island: just above australia. it's boundary b/w asia & oceania. (western-> asia; eastern-> oceania)
highest point of asia: mt everest (boundary of nepal & china)
lowest point on earth's surface: dead sea 
europe
it's c/a peninsulas of peninsula
largest county in world: russia
smallest country in world: vatican city (within italy)
africa
it was c/a dark continent because it was discovered recently.
mediterranean sea: joins europe from africa
largest desert in world: sahara desert
longest river in world: nile river
north america
it includes usa, canada, mexico, central america, etc.
latin america: all north & south america, excluding usa & canada, which speak languages derived from latin.

topic for next class: geomorphology & mapping (continued)
