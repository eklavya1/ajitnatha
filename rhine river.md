- the rhine (german: rhein [ʁaɪ̯n], french: rhin, dutch: rijn, walloon: rén, limburgish: rien, sursilvan: rein, sutsilvan and surmiran: ragn, rumantsch grischun, vallader, and puter: rain, italian: reno, alemannic german: rhi(n) including alsatian/low alemannic german, ripuarian, low franconian: rhing, latin: rhenus [ˈr̥eːnʊs], hungarian: rajna) is one of the major european rivers. the river begins in the swiss canton of graubünden in the southeastern swiss alps, forms part of the swiss-liechtenstein, swiss-austrian, swiss-german and then the franco-german border, then flows in a mostly northerly direction through the german rhineland and the netherlands and eventually empties into the north sea.

- it is the second-longest river in central and western [[europe]] (after the [[danube river]]), at about 1,230 km (760 mi), with an average discharge of about 2,900 m3/s (100,000 cu ft/s).

- the rhine and the danube comprised much of the [[roman empire]]'s northern inland boundary, and the rhine has been a vital navigable waterway bringing trade and goods deep inland since those days.

- the various castles and defenses built along it attest to its prominence as a waterway in the holy roman empire.

- among the largest and most important cities on the rhine are cologne, düsseldorf, rotterdam, strasbourg and basel.
