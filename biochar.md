biochar is a high-carbon, fine-grained residue that is currently produced through modem pyrolysis processes (direct thermal decomposition of biomass in absence of oxygen& preventing combustion). 
it produces a mixture of solids (biochar proper), liquid (bio-oil),& gas (syngas) products.
biochar may increase soil ferülity of acidic soils (low ph soils), increase agricultural productivity,& provide protection against some foliar& soil-bome diseases.

## its benefits
**carbon sink:**
• buming& natural decomposition of biomass release large amounts of carbon dioxide& methane to earth's atmosphere-
• biochar production process also releases c02 (up to 50% of biomass); however, remaining carbon content is stable indefinitely.

**soil amendment:**
• biochar is recognized as offering a number of soil health benefits-
• extremely porous nature of biochar is found to be effective at retaining both water& water-soluble nutrients.
• its presence in earth can improve water quality, increase soil fertility, raise agricultural productivity,& reduce pressure on forests-

**water retention:**
• biochar is hygroscopic.
• thus it's a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract& retain water.
