## re[[capital]]isation of [[bank]]s
- re[[capital]]isation of [[bank]]s(1:42:00pm)
- re[[capital]]isation refers to raising [[money]] by owners of a [[business]] & giving it to [[business]] for purpose of utilisation by [[business]].
- owner can infuse [[capital]] in diff ways, most commonly by either diluting equity or raising [[debt]].
- for public sector [[bank]]s, govt provides some budgetary or extra-budgetary support as well.
- new way of re[[capital]]isation by issuing recap bonds was also taken recourse to in [[2017]].
- under this, govt borrows from [[bank]]s by issuing them these [[bond]]s, & then by virtue of being owner gives this [[money]] back to [[bank]] to be used as [[capital]].
- [[bank]] is able to lend to govt without any additional [[capital]] requirements b/c govt is theoretically a 0 risk entity. as such lending to it does not incr a [[bank]]'s risk-weighted assets & thus, minimum [[capital]] requirement as well as any provisioning against this lending.
- govt then simply gives this [[money]] back to [[bank]] in form of [[capital]]. essentially, in this transaction [[bank]]s liabilities are being converted into their [[capital]] via govt.
## reforms of [[bank]]ing sector

### reforms in context of PSBs
- reform is a dynamic & continuous process.
- in case of PSBs, it means that [[bank]]s should adjust to needs of market & do not remain stuck to old ways.
- to bring in reforms in PSBs, idea of a [[bank]] holding company was suggested. govt will transfer its ownership to BHC & now various appointments of PSBs at senior level will be taken up by bhc. 
- bhc is not set up as of now. currently, role of bhc is being taken up by bbb ([[bank]]s board bureau) & this BBB will be responsible for appointment of higher [[management]]/senior roles of [[bank]]s.
- vision of bbb is to search & select apposite personages for board of public sector [[bank]]s, public sector financial institutions & public sector insurance companies & recommend measures to improve corporate governance in these institutions.

- NBFCs can not take deposits like [[bank]]s. however, there are some exceptions. a handful of NBFCs can take deposits (only time deposits) after taking permission from rbi.
- no NBFC can take demand deposits (no exceptions).
- they usually raise [[money]] from other [[bank]]s or from investors.
- NBFC have also to comply with basel norms & crar has to be maintained which is 15% of their risk-weighted assets. [[basel convention]] [[basel committee on banking supervision]]
- NBFCs can lend [[money]] (regulated by [[rbi]]), NBFCs can invest [[money]](regulated by rbi & [[sebi]]). some NBFCs operating at smaller levels are regulated by state govts.
- multiple regulations lead to regulatory arbitrage which sometimes results in scams. for ex- rose valley scam.
- refer to handout- nabard & NBFCs.

## govt budgeting & fiscal policy
- govt budgeting & fiscal policy(3:22:00pm)

- a brief overview of chapter
### budgeting
- [[knowledge]] about your incomes & simultaneously planning for expenditure.
- govt budgeting involves knowledge of [[income]] sources of govt, timing of incomes to be received & planning for expenditure in indian [[economy]].
govt budgeting has primarily 3 objectives -
1. expenditure allocation function & achieve maximum welfare of [[society]].
2. redistribution function (taxation) by ensuring redistribution of [[wealth]] such that [[rich]] pay more & poor pay fewer taxes.
3. stabilisation function means bringing stability in [[economy]] & trying to achieve multiple macroeconomic objectives. there is a trade-off b/w [[growth]] & [[inflation]] & this also is maintained.
### various budgeting techniques
[[accounting]] is noting down income & expenses whereas budgeting involves planning part as well.
foll categorisation can be seen as evolution of budgeting process: #pneumonic *LPO*
#### 1. line item budgeting
it's a budgeting technique where you *write down line by line* how you are going to spend.
it's most primitive form of budgeting & involves more data than information. 
#### 2. program budgeting
when a *line-item budget is organised under various heads* (c/a programs) properly, it's k/a program budgeting.
3, performance budgeting
it focuses on *[[efficiency]] of expenditure*.
it sees whether your input is able to meet [[output]] at best efficient rate.
#### 4. outcome budgeting
it goes 1 step ahead of performance budgeting & *focuses on outcome*. it's diff from output.
for ex, output is creation of school infrastructure while educational attainment rate will come under outcome part.
*output is something tangible whereas outcome is a long term goal or objective.*
### specific ways of implementing outcome budgeting
1. zero-based budgeting
under this, *expenditure will be allocated to any scheme not b/c that scheme was allocated [[money]] in past, but only when demanding entity will justify previous allocation made to it.*
every scheme will be analysed from a 0 base, that is, as a fresh scheme for coming year.
2. gender-based budgeting
under this, expenditure done under a scheme will be analysed from perspective of diffial impact that scheme is going to have on gender situation in society.
for ex, more [[expenditure]] on [[law]] & order will result in improving situation of women's safety.
