bees are most prolific pollinators. they cn pollinate up to 20 million flowers a day in a swarm size of 20,000 bees. bee pollination is also k/a **melittophily**.
wasps are not as efficient as bees. they look like bees but unlike bees, they have no hairs on their body that pollen cn stick to when they hover over flower till they have drunk enough nectar.
black & white lemurs are esp fond of nectar & have sp noses that resemble beaks to dig deep within crevices of flowers. not solely, but certainly being 1 of big contributors to their propagation. they are esp responsible for spread of traveler's trees, whose fruits grow at a considerable height & no other animal travels that high up to inadvertently pollinate it.
using animals as vectors for pollination is quite energy-intensive for plants â€” like producing nectars to attract pollinators. but pay-off is that animal pollinators almost always result in pollination.
cows dont associate with process of pollination.
other animals that help in pollination are- ants, flies, birds, bats, hoverflies, moths, etc.
