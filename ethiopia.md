The World Food Programme (WFP) has suspended the distribution of food aid in two northern Ethiopian towns after gunmen looted its warehouses.

The United Nations said looters from rebel Tigrayan forces held aid staff at gunpoint in the town of Kombolcha. They 
stole large quantities of essential food supplies, including some for malnourished children.
Northern Ethiopia is facing mass starvation amid an ongoing civil war between Tigrayan and government forces. After more than a year of fighting, more than nine million people are in need of critical food supplies in the Tigray, Amhara and Afar regions, the UN says.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is the food-assistance branch of the United Nations. Founded in 1961 , it is headquartered in Rome.
