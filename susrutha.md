Sushruta, or Suśruta (Sanskrit: सुश्रुत, IAST: Suśruta, lit. 'well heard') was an ancient Indian physician and surgeon  known today as India's “Father of Surgery” and “Father of Plastic Surgery”  or "father of brain surgery" for inventing and developing surgical procedures. His work on the subject, the Sushruta Samhita (Sushruta's Compendium) is considered one of the oldest texts in the world on plastic surgery and is highly regarded as one of the Great Trilogy of Ayurvedic Medicine, the Brihat-Trayi; the other two being the Charaka Samhita, which preceded it, and the Astanga Hridaya, which followed it.The Sushruta Samhita is one of the most important surviving ancient treatises on medicine and is considered a foundational text of Ayurveda. The treatise addresses all aspects of general medicine, but the impressive chapters on surgery have led to the false impression that this is its main topic.  The translator G. D. Singhal dubbed Suśruta "the father of surgery" on account of these detailed accounts of surgery.The Compendium of Suśruta locates its author in Varanasi, India
