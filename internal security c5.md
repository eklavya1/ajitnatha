Security Class 05

1:07 PM: Cyber Security Continued...
1:07 PM: Cyber Security Continued...

## Cases of cyber breaches
Cases of cyber breaches:
The leak of personal information of 3.2 million debit cards in 2016
Data Theft At Zomato (2017), Wannacry Ransomware (2017), PETYA Ransomware (2017), etc.
In today's news, Russia's Space program is hacked 
Need for Cyber Security in India:
National Security Imperative- to build a resilient cyber-infrastructure that is hackproof
Increasing Importance of Digital Economy - entire transaction has started to move slowly towards digitization, UPI, NEFT, Payment Wallets, etc.
Securing Data- Oil for 21st-century economy = data is the new fuel, it's importance in the 21st century
The Internet penetration rate in India went up to nearly around 45% in 2021, from just about 4% percent in 2007.
Steps were taken by the Indian Government:
1) Legal/Policy Front:
IT Act, 2000 - Section 66D identity theft, Section 66F for cyber terrorism, Section 66E for denial of access, Section 67A deals with voyeurism, Section 66B for child pornography, etc.
Infosec awareness- The website provides over 1,000 workshops tailored to inform government, academic, and general internet users about software security, popular attacks, and computer terminology
National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP), 2013 - Needs to be revisited again as it is a decade-old policy and many new things have emerged that need to be dealt with.
The Policy proposes to:
Set up different bodies to tackle various levels of threats, along with a national nodal agency, to coordinate all matters related to cyber security. CERT-in is created which will provide a response, analyze and prevent cyber threats.
Create a National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC)
Create a workforce of around 500,000 trained in cyber security in five years.
Provide fiscal benefits to businesses to adopt best security practices.
Set up testing labs to regularly check the safety of equipment being used in the country.
Create a cyber ecosystem in the country, developing effective public-private partnerships and collaborative engagements through technical and operational cooperation.
Building indigenous security technologies through research
Recent threats evolved = IP Spoofing, a man in the middle attack (MITM), etc.
Limitations of the National Cyber Security Policy, 2013:
The poor manufacturing base of the electronic items
Lack of involvement and incentivizing private sector
Poor capacity in terms of human development, etc,
2) Institutional steps:
Cert-In (Computer Emergency Response Team- India)
Sectoral Certs have been developed by various ministries like the Ministry of Power, etc.
National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC)
Cyber Swachhta Kendra, etc.
2:10 PM: Challenges in Protecting Critical Infrastructure:
Internal Resources: Many organizations including those that help to maintain Critical Infrastructure do not have enough trained security professionals to meet their security needs.
Reluctance in Sharing Information: Fear of losing a competitive edge over rivals inhibits the private and public sector to share information about the vulnerability of their systems.
Lack of coordination among agencies: Some of the agencies report to the Ministry of Home Affairs, while others report to the Prime Minister’s Office, Defence ministry, MeitY, etc.
Capability Asymmetry: India lacks indigenization in hardware as well as software cybersecurity tools. This makes India’s cyberspace vulnerable to cyberattacks motivated by state and non-state actors
Challenges with respect to cyber-security:
Lack of awareness
Lack of adequately trained workforce
Lack of budget/investment
Lack of coordination between different agencies
Imported Telecom equipment-India imports around 70%
Data privacy: Absence of comprehensive data protection law
Overdependence of government agencies on the external server

## PM: Budapest Convention
2:21 PM: Budapest Convention

Proposed in 2001 by western countries and came into effect in 2004
It serves as a guideline for any country developing comprehensive national legislation against Cybercrime and as a framework for international cooperation between state parties to this treaty.
India has not signed the convention - India's concerns
a) it is not universally applicable and is applicable to member countries only, 
b) India was not involved in consultation during the framing stage
c) Highly biased towards the western world
d) Seen as a mode to sell expensive technologies by west
e) Sovereignty issues
Also lays down specific standards that are to be enforced for cybersecurity around the world
Technology and resources sharing to curb cybersecurity threat 
Arguments in favor of India joining the Convention:
a) India can influence the future of the treaty by becoming its member
b) Access to the latest and cheap technology as India will be designated as a priority country
c) Formulate comprehensive data protection act, so now apprehensions left regarding concern over data sovereignty

## Suggestions or Way Forward
Suggestions or Way Forward:

The articulation of a comprehensive national cyberspace strategy;
The technological development of cyber security capabilities;
The development of human resources and human capital at operational levels;
A synchronized governance/organizational structure;
Training and assimilating a cyber force for offensive and defensive operations. 

## Recommendations of Gulshan Rai Committee and Inderjeet Rao Committee
Recommendations of Gulshan Rai Committee and Inderjeet Rao Committee:

Creation of Cybercrimes cell in each state and district
Appropriate certification for the adoption of best practices
More research and development is required
Also, train manpower to enhance the capacity
Internet servers should be hosted within the country, eg RBI has imposed data localization for banks
Regular and consistent changes should be brought in the IT Act and other legislation to tackle cyber threat
A separate agency should be created to deal with the data breach
Stringent penalty provisions should be placed to deter individuals and agencies from misusing private data

Break 2:47 PM / Resumed at 2:58 PM

## Social Media
Social Media:

It helps in enhancing the reach for the govt agencies
It helps in seeking feedback from the citizens.
It is used for real-time engagement 
It can be used for managing perception
Social Media Labs = Prone to radicalization, detect the internal threats
National Face Recognition Software = to avert threats, to create a social database, 
Bust rumors and fake news
3:20 PM: Threats that social media is posing to India's Internal Security:
Fake news = threat to life, a threat to communal harmony (eg Muzaffarnagar Riots 2013), 
Used for organizing mob violent attack = London Riots 2012
Promotion of Pornography and Obscenity 
Used for cyberbullying and harassment at times leads to sexual crimes
Used as a tool to snoop on individuals and also determine and guide their behavior, eg. Cambridge Analytica Issue
Used by terrorist organizations
Social networking sites are the biggest threat in terms of malware, spyware, etc.
It is difficult to overcome these challenges:
Huge and expanding number of users
Ineffectiveness of censorship on content and impact on freedom of speech
Difficulty in prosecution and tracking of crime due to jurisdiction problems and anonymity offered by the internet.
Lack of geographical boundaries makes social media regulation an arduous task
Lack of digital literacy amongst people
Artificial Intelligence is still new and is in its early stages of development and cannot be used to regulate the sector.
Wayforward:
Responsible use of social media must be taught by increasing digital literacy
Strengthening of cyber security organizations and IT cells of law enforcement agencies
Data protection and privacy must be enhanced, etc.
Other things to be referred to from the handout
