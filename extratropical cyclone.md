systems developing in mid & high latitudes (350 latitude & 650 latitude in both hemispheres), beyond tropics, are called temperate cyclones or extra-tropical cyclones or mid-latitude cyclones or frontal cyclones or wave cyclones.
they develop when waveforms on a frontal surface separate a warm air mass from a cold air mass.
thus, extra-tropical cyclones form along polar front.
in northem hemisphere, warm air blows from south & cold air from north of front.
when pressure drops along front, warm air moves northwards & cold air move towards south setting in motion an anti-clockwise cyclonic circulation.
cyclonic circulation leads to a well-developed extratropical cyclone, with a warm front & a cold front.
they cover a larger area & can originate over land & sea.
wind velocity in a tropical cyclone is much higher & it is more destructive.
extra-tropical cyclones move from west to east in northern hemisphere.

Size and Shape
The temperate cyclones are asymmetrical and shaped like an inverted 'V'.
o They stretch over 500 to 600 km.
o They may spread over 2500 km over North America (Polar Vortex).
o They have a height of 8 to 11 km.

Wind Velocity And Strength
The wind strength is more in eastem and southem portions, more over North America compared to Europe.
The wind velocity increases with the approach but decreases after the cyclone has passed.

Associated Weather
o The approach of a temperate cyclone is marked by a fall in temperature, a fall in the mercury level, wind shifts and a halo around the sun and the moon, and a thin veil of cirrus clouds. Hence,
statement 3 is correct.
