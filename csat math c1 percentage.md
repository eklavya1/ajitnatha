PERCENTAGE

learn [[fractions]]
By a certain percent, we mean that many hundredths.
Thus, x percent means x hundredths, written as x%.
To express x% : We have, x% =x/100.Thus, 20% =20/100
X% of Y =x/y*100
To calculate percentage change in value
 Percentage change = {change/(initial value)} x 100 .
If A is x% more than B, then B is 100x/(100 + x) % more than A and vice versa.

PRACTICE QUESTIONS

some standard formulas
work = efficiency x time
expenditure = price x consumption
distance = speed x time
colume of cuboid = l x b x h
