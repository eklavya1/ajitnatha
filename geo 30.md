(10 marks)
# summary
geography class 30

**salinity of ocean**

-   [[number]] of grams of dissolved salts in 1000 gm of seawater.
-   amounts of salt dissolved in water.

**measure of salinity**

-   it's measured in parts per thousand (ppt)(symbol 0/00)
-   average salinity of earth’s ocean is equal to 35 ppt.

**sources of salinity**

-   continents (rocks), through dissolving action of rivers & [[geo 25|rainfall]].
-   [[evaporation]] at oceans: through which salts are left behind in water. this leads to increase in concentration of salts.
-   volcanic eruptions on ocean floor [[egypt|eg]]:  hotspots & mor etc.
-   salinity of oceans remains constant as factors adding up salts are balanced by factors reducing salinity. eg: precipitation, river water, ice  melting, precipitation of salts along on [[ocean]] floor
-   most saline water body in india is sambhar salt lake.
-   most saline water body in india is lake vaan of [[turkey]].

**factors affecting salinity**

-   [[temperature]] leads to more evaporation hence higher salinity.
-   wind leads to more evaporation hence higher salinity.
-   precipitation leads to inflow of freshwater leading to equatorial region will have lesser salinity than subtropics.
-   low salinity along deltas of ganga (suderban delta), amazon, etc.
-   formation of ice leads to increase in salinity eg polar regions along margins where ice is forming.
-   [[ocean]] currents help in distribution of salinity across world ocean.

**vertical distribution of salinity**

-   **along polar regions:** salinity is low near to surface due to lower rates of evaporation.
-   however, salinity increases with depth to become uniform after a certain depth.
-   **along subtropical regions:** higher [[evaporation]] leads to high salinity along surface & decreases sharply & becomes uniform after a certain depth.
-   **in equatorial regions:** high precipitation leads to low salinity in upper layer & it increases with depth & then decreases to some depth & finally becomes uniform.

**horizontal distribution of water**

-   subtropical waters>equatorial waters >polar waters (salinity in descending order)
-   water bodies with above normal salinity (reason: sub tropical regions & enclosed water body) [[egypt|eg]] mediterranean sea, red sea, [[persian]] gulf.
-   seas with below normal continuity, barent sea, north sea, gulf of st lawrence, arctic ocean 
-   lake vaan (330ppt), [[dead sea]] (240 ppt), [[great salt lake]] (220 ppt)

**ocean deposits**

-   **types of ocean deposits**
-   **lithogenus/ terrigenous** eg. sand, gravels, silt, mud, 
-   these are majorly found on [[continental shelf]].
-   **biogenous / organic deposits:** eg. shells, corals, ooze. 
-   skeletal remains of dead & decaying microscopic marine organisms are c/a ooze
-   types of [[ooze]]: silicious & calcareous
-   **inorganic/ hydrogenous deposits** eg.
-   minerals that are not dissolved gradually get precipitated & sink to bottom.
-   they are formed through precipitation of minerals in ocean water 
-   eg. pmn (polymetallic nodules), pms (poly metallic sulphides), red clay
-   pmn & pms are sources of metallic minerals.
-   **cosmogenous deposits**
-   these are depositions derived from space (outside earth)
-   ex meteoritic debris

**coral reefs**

-   corals are masses of limestone & dolomite accumulated by a lime secreting organism c/a coral polyps.
-   they are developed due to symbiotic relationship b/w coral polyps (provides habitat) & [[zooxanthellae]] algae (provides food).
-   coral reef provides habitat to zooxanthellaev (algae) nearly 31 phyla of animals leading to rich biodiversity. 
-   therefore, they are also c/a rainforests of oceans.

condition for survival of coral reefs\

-   [[temperature]] 20 degrees celsius
-   thus, they are not found on western coast of continent in tropical regions, due to presence of cold [[ocean currents]]. 
-   [[latitude]]: 30 n- 30 s
-   depth: 200-250 ft
-   average salinity
-   water should not consist of too much  sediment as it will clog mouth of coral polyps
-   submarine platforms

**types of coral reefs:**

-   fringing reef: these are narrow coral platforms lying close to coast eg coral reefs of caribbean sea & a&n islands of india.
-   barrier reef: it's a wide coral platform located far from coast & separated by [[lagoon]]. ex great barrier reef
-   note: both above types are found on continent shelves.
-   atoll: circular [[coral reefs]] developed surrounding islands or a sea mount or guyout [[egypt|eg]] lakshadweep & [[island]] of pacific ocean.

**distribution of corals**

-   corals are found in areas given below,
-   gulf of [[mexico]], caribbean sea, western atlantic region near south america, red sea, [[persian]] gulf, & western indian [[ocean]].
-   **coral triangle**: ne australia, indonesia philippines
-   majority of pacific islands have coral reefs.
-   in india, corals are found in a&n, lakshadweep, gulf mannar, gulf of kutch
-   eastern coast (high amount of river: n)

**coral bleaching:**

-   corals receive their coloration from algae living in a symbiotic relationship 
-   corals bleaching refers to loss of color of corals due to stress-induced expulsion of symbiotic algae.
-   **reasons behind coral bleaching**
-   global warming (causes changes in [[temperature]]),
-   oceanic acidification,
-   changes in salinity,
-   increased sedimentation,
-   water pollution,
-   dredging & trawling,
-   elnino,
-   increased storms & cyclones etc.
-   **exs**
-   b/w 2014-2017, due to  el nino, great barrier reef was bleached by 50 percent.
-   1997-1998: 90 % of north indian ocean lost its [[coral reefs]].

**next class: ocean current, el nino, la nina, [[tides]].**
