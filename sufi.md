Sufism was a mystical tradition of Islam that stressed self-realization, tolerance, righteousness, and universal love for all.
The Sufis were the Fakirs or the poor men who strived to attain the maximum form of purity called ikhlas.
Their ultimate objective was to be one with God and stressed that love for humanity was the love for God.
They strictly followed the concept of pir-murshid, which was the GuruShishya tradition.
The gurus were called the pirs or sheikhs and the shishyas were the murshids.
Sufi saints were revered by the rulers and were one of the recipients of Inam or the land grant
The Inam was transferred to their descendants and this provided them with an economic base and hence uplifted their status on the social ladder.
The Sufis were divided into Be-shara who did not believe in the Sharia law and the Ba-shara in favour of the Sharia Law
Hence, not all the Sufis were followers of sharia law.
The Ba-sharas were further organized into silsilahs with the important ones being Chisti, Suhrawardi, Firdausi, Qadariya, Naqshbandi, etc.
The Be-sharas were wanderers and generally referred to as Mast Kalandars or babas.

Fana: Spiritual merger of the devotee with Allah
Insan-e-kamil: Perfect human with all good virtues,
Zikr-tauba: a remembrance of god all the time(zikr),
Wahadatul-wazudi: one god for the entire universe; unity of god and being
Sama: spiritual dance and music to promote their concepts, though music is un-lslamic.

Sufism (Arabic: ٱلصُّوفِيَّة), also known as Tasawwuf (ٱلتَّصَوُّف), is a mystic body of religious practice within Islam characterized by a focus on Islamic spirituality, ritualism, asceticism and esotericism.It has been variously defined as "Islamic mysticism", "the mystical expression of Islamic faith", "the inward dimension of Islam", "the phenomenon of mysticism within Islam", the "main manifestation and the most important and central crystallization" of mystical practice in Islam, and "the interiorization and intensification of Islamic faith and practice".Practitioners of Sufism are referred to as "Sufis" (from صُوفِيّ, ṣūfīy), and historically typically belonged to "orders" known as tariqa (pl. ṭuruq) – congregations formed around a grand master wali who would be the last in a chain of successive teachers linking back to Muhammad.Sufism emerged early on in Islamic history, partly as a reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad Caliphate (661–750). Although Sufis were opposed to dry legalism, they strictly observed Islamic law and belonged to various schools of Islamic jurisprudence and theology. Although the overwhelming majority of Sufis, both pre-modern and modern, remain adherents of Sunni Islam, certain strands of Sufi practice developed within the ambit of Shia Islam during the late medieval period, particularly after the Safavid conversion of Iran. Important focuses of Sufi worship include dhikr, the practice of remembrance of God. Sufis also played an important role in Islamic history through their missionary and educational activities.Despite a relative decline of Sufi orders in the modern era, Sufism has continued to play an important role in the Islamic world, and has also influenced various forms of spirituality in the West.
