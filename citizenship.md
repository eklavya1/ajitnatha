Citizenship is listed in the [[Union List]] under the [[Constitution]]
Under the exclusive jurisdiction of [[Parliament]].
The Constitution does not define the term 'citizen' but details of various categories of persons who are entitled to citizenship are given in Part 2 (Articles 5 to 11).
These articles were enforced on November 26, 1949, when the Constitution was adopted.
