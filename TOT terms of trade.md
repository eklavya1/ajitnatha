- • Terms of trade (TOT) represent the ratio between a country's export prices and its import prices
 - ◦ The ratio is calculated by dividing the price of the exports by the price of the imports and multiplying the result by 100.
 - ◦ Therefore, when more capital is leaving the country then is entering into the country then the country’s TOT is less than 100%. When the TOT is greater than 100%, the country is accumulating more capital from exports than it is spending on imports.
 - ◦ An improvement or increase in a country's TOT generally indicates that export prices have gone up as import prices have either maintained or dropped.
 - ◦ An increase in the TOT can thus be beneficial because the country needs fewer exports to buy a given number of imports.
 - ◦ Exchange and inflation rates and prices affect the Terms of Trade as they impact the export and import of a country.  Hence option (a) is the correct answer.
 - • It is the most-favored-nation (MFN) clause under the World Trade Organization (WTO) which provides a level of treatment accorded by one state to another in international trade. Therefore, MFN
 - ◦  requires that a country act fairly with all WTO member countries, extending the same privileges and immunities granted to one country to all members.
 - ◦ MFN advocates for a non-discriminatory trade policy, ensuring equal trading among all WTO member nations.
