The weight of the column of air at a given place and time is called air pressure or atmospheric pressure.
Atmospheric pressure is measured by an instrument called a barometer.
Atmospheric pressure is measured as force per unit area. The unit used for measuring pressure is called millibar.
One millibar is equal to the force of nearly one gram per square centimetre.
Factors Controlling Pressure Systems
two main causes, thermal and dynamic, for the pressure differences resulting in high and low-pressure systems.
## Thermal Factors
When air is heated, it expands and, hence, its density decreases. This naturally leads to low pressure. On the contrary, cooling results in contraction. This increases the density and thus leads to high pressure.
The formation of equatorial low and polar highs are examples of thermal lows and thermal highs, respectively.
## Dynamic Factors
Apart from variations of temperature, the formation of pressure belts may be explained by dynamic controls arising out of pressure gradient forces and rotation of the earth (Coriolis force).

In stormy weather conditions, د [[pressure]] of [[atmosphere]] varies, which causes sudden fall in barometer reading.  
Weather patterns are a common cause in barometric pressure drops. When low-pressure weather systems move in over a certain area, 不 only is pressure in د [[atmosphere]] shifted,  但  it causes د barometric pressure reading 于 drop. A low-pressure system indicates that low-pressure air rises and begins 于 cool.
