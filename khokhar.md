Khokhar is a Jat community of Punjab region currently residing in adjoining areas of Pakistan and India. The word Khokhar itself means "Bloodthirsty" and its origin is from Persian language. Khokhars follow Islam and are predominantly Muslims. Khokhars converted to Islam after coming under the influence of Baba Fariduddin Ganjshakar. The Persian historian of the medieval period Firishta has mentioned Khokhars in his writings as, "A barbaric race without religion and morality". Khokhars were the most influential, powerful and dominant tribe of Punjab during the 13th, 14th and 15th century.
