It is the decrease in the aggregate supply of goods and services stemming from an increase in the cost of production.
Cost-push inflation occurs when overall prices increase (inflation) due to increases in the cost of wages and raw materials (inputs). Hence, Statement 3 is not correct.
Demand-pull inflation is the increase in aggregate demand, categorized by the four sections of the macroeconomy: households, businesses, governments, and foreign buyers.
An increase in the costs of raw materials or labor can contribute to cost-pull inflation.
Demand-pull inflation can be caused by an expanding economy, increased government spending, or overseas growth.
