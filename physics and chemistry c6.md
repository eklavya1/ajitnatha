# Higgs Boson Theory
(1:03 PM)
Satyendra Nath Bose:
	His theory indicated the existence of fundamental particles, which were later named as â€˜bosonsâ€™.
Quarks make up, amongst other things, the protons, and neutrons in the nucleus.
Leptons include electrons and neutrinos.
# Big Bang
At T= 13.7 billion years ago, Universe started (it was a tiny dense mass, having infinite density). 
T=10^-13 seconds (after the Big Bang), cosmic inflation started along with an explosion. This created space and time. 
After that, an interactive Higgs field emerged.
At this point in time, a hot soup of quarks and leptons was present.
Both Quarks and Leptons were chargeless and massless during this phase.
Electrons absorbed the light making the universe dark and opaque. This phase is called the â€˜Dark Agesâ€™ in the Universe.
Later the electrons released the light in form of Gamma Radiations making the universe transparent once again. 
Quarks interacted more with Higgs field than Leptons. 
Quarks started among them to give protons and neutrons.
Similarly, Leptons produced electrons and neutrinos.
When Proton and Electron come together Hydrogen is formed.
This will lead to nuclear fusion.
When stars die, the denser elements like Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, etc. are formed which are the basis of DNA or life.
# Theory of Relativity
(1:29 PM)
- E=mc2. _related_ [[movies#^76449e]] | [[interstellar movie]] | [[]] 
- Light always travels in a straight line.
- The speed of light is maximum and no object in the universe can match the speed of light.
- The entire universe is sitting on an imaginary space-time fabric.
- Any object in the universe having mass and acceleration warps or curves the space-time fabric.
- In the process of warping, they create ripples or disturbances in the universe known as gravitational waves. 
- These waves are too weak to be detected but some major events like the merger of two black holes etc. can create comparatively stronger gravitational waves that can be detected.
# Einstein-Rosen Bridge (Wormhole)
-  _related_ [[avengers]] | [[tony stark]]
Blackhole warp space-time infinitely, in the process of warping it can bring two points in the universe nearer to each other. I.e. it can act as a bridge that reduces the physical distance between two points.  
Wormholes can make intergalactic travel possible, but presently traveling through wormholes is not possible as they are very small.
# Gravitational Lensing
(2:03 PM)
A massive matter like Galaxy, black hole, etc. creates a stronger gravitational field which causes light waves to pass close to that matter.
In this process, light is slightly bent or refocused somewhere, this is called gravitational lensing. 
# Theory of Relativity
The universe is constantly expanding.
Galaxies appear to be red-shifted (Doppler shift).
Cosmic background radiations are found in the microwave range instead of the gamma range.
# Dark Energy
(2:28 PM)
After the Big bang, the matter was created and matter attract each other by the force of gravitation because of which the universe must have collapsed by now.
But we have evidence of expanding universe, which means there must be some hidden energy to counter the effect of gravitation.
This hidden energy is dark energy.
