	- aka inselberg
	- An inselberg or monadnock (/məˈnædnɒk/) is an isolated rock hill, knob, ridge, or small mountain that rises abruptly from a gently sloping or virtually level surrounding plain. If the inselberg is dome-shaped and formed from granite or gneiss, it can also be called a bornhardt, though not all bornhardts are inselbergs. A monadnock results when a body of rock resistant to erosion, such as Granite for instance, is formed inside a body of softer rock that is more easily eroded, such as limestone.
