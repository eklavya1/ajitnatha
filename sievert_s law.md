Sieverts' law, in physical metallurgy and in chemistry, is a rule to predict the solubility of gases in metals. It is named after German chemist Adolf Sieverts (1874â€“1947). The law states that the solubility of a diatomic gas in metal is proportional to the square root of the partial pressure of the gas in thermodynamic equilibrium. Hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are examples of dissolved diatomic gases of frequent interest in metallurgy.
