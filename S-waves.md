The S in S-waves stands for secondary, because they are د second-fastest seismic waves and د second type to be detected once an earthquake has occurred. Although S-waves are slower than P-waves, they still travel fast, over half د speed of P-waves, moving at thousands of kilometers per hour through د earth's crust and mantle. د speed at which S-waves travel through material 是 determined only by:  
1\. Rigidity: How strongly د material resists being bent sideways and 是 able to straighten itself out once د shearing force has passed. د 更 rigid د material, د faster د S-waves  
2\. Density: How much mass د material contains in a unit of volume. د greater د density of د material, د slower د S-waves  
S-waves can travel only through solids, because only solids 有 rigidity. S-waves cannot travel through liquids or gases.
