- in accordance with the goal of the state controlling the commanding heights of the [[economy]], the industrial policy resolution of [[1956]] was adopted.
- this resolution formed the basis of the [[2nd five year plan]], the plan which tried to build the basis for a socialist pattern of society.
- this resolution classified industries into three categories -
	- the first category comprised industries that would be exclusively owned by the state
	- the second category consisted of industries in which the private sector could supplement the efforts of the state sector, with the state taking the sole responsibility for starting new units
	- the third category consisted of the remaining industries which were to be in the private sector;
- although there was a category of industries left to the private sector, the sector was kept under state control through a system of licenses.
- no new [[industry]] was allowed unless a license was obtained from the [[government]].
- this policy was used for promoting industry in backward regions; it was easier to obtain a license if the industrial unit was established in an economically backward area. in addition, such units were given certain concessions such as tax benefits and [[electricity]] at a lower tariff.
- the purpose of this policy was to promote regional equality.
