when economy has both current account deficit & fiscal deficit, it's said to be facing twin deficit.
both deficits often reinforce each other.
current account measures flow of goods, services, & investments into & out of country.
there is a deficit in current account if value of goods & services imported exceeds value of those exported. it comprises of foll components:
	• trade of goods,
	• services, and
net earnings on overseas investments & net transfer of payments over a period of time, such as remittances.
hence, current account = trade gap + net current transfers + net income abroad
it cn be reduced by boosting exports & curbing non-essential imports such as gold, mobiles, & electronics.
a fiscal deficit's a shortfall in a govemment's income compared with its spending. it's usually measured as a % of gdp.
as per cga data, for financial year [[2020]], india's fiscal deficit widened to 4.59% of gross domestic product (gdp) for previous fiscal, overshooting govt's revised target of 3.8%. (may 2020)
