# assignment
- what are fluvial processes? explain landforms formed in its various stages. (150 words/10 marks)
- (10 marks)
# summary	

geography class 18

a brief revision of previous class

landforms

questions will be on 3 major things:
process 
erosional features (eg: valley)
depositional features (eg: delta)
diff types of landforms 
riverine topography - mainly because of rivers 
karst  topography - formed because of underground water
desert topography - formed because of wind 
marine topography- formed because of coastal waters 
glacial topography - formed because of glaciers 

landforms & features

riverine topography 
youth stage - where there are mountains, steep slope, therefore, energy very high & its velocity is also high 
river flows in a straight path, high degree of erosion
erosion is vertical, no deposition, no meandering
mature stage - once river enters plain 
they have just entered plain with some slope 
energy is moderate, velocity is also lesser 
this brings meanders, lateral erosion takes place no vertical erosion 
a deposition is also present, here both erosional & depositional feature is found here 
old stage
totally flat, no slope 
high degree of deposition, no erosion takes place here 
energy & speed decreases 
after this, it joins ocean 
high meandering
seven erosional processes which can be active in any kind of landform 
abrasion, attrition, corrosion, cavitation, deflation, hydraulic action, plucking 
geomorphic agent 	process 	erosional features 	depositional features
riverine or fluvial topography  	river 	

abrasion, attrition, corrosion, cavitation, hydraulic action
v-shaped valley –because of vertical erosion in youth stage, gorge, canyon, rapid, cataract, waterfalls, meanders-river cliff (erosional feature), river capture 	slip off-slope (depositional feature of meander), flood plains, ox-bow lake, alluvial fan, delta, estuary
karst  	

underground water.

(erstwhile yugoslavia, mexico, italy, etc)
abrasion, attrition, corrosion 	sinkhole, swallow hole,  uvala, blind valley 	stalactite, stalagmite, pillars
marine 	coastal water  	abrasion, attrition, corrosion, cavitation, hydraulic action  	cliff, wave-cut platform, bay, hanging valley, sea cave, sea stacks, stump, blowhole  	beach coastal lagoon, sand spit, sand bar, sand dunes, tombolo 
arid 	wind 	abrasion, attrition, deflation 	deflation hollow, ventifact, mushroom rock, zeugen, yardang, inselberg  	barchan, sand dunes, self, parabolic, transverse
glacial 	

glaciers


abrasion, plucking  	cirque, hanging valley, horn, cirque, combe, arete  	

lateral moraines, medial moraines, end moraine, tillite, drumlin, esker
