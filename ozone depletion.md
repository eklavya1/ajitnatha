[[ozone]] in the stratosphere is a product of uv radiations acting on dioxygen (02) molecules.
the uv radiations split apart molecular oxygen into free oxygen (o) atoms.
ozone is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to molecular oxygen. thus, a dynamic equilibrium exists between production & decomposition of ozone molecules.
in recent years, there have been reports of the depletion of this protective ozone layer because of the presence of certain chemicals in the stratosphere.
the main reason for ozone layer depletion is the release of chlorofluorocarbon compounds (cfcs), also known as freons.
these compounds are nonreactive, nonflammable, nontoxic organic molecules and therefore used in refrigerators, air conditioners, in the production of plastic foam, and by the electronic industry for cleaning computer parts, etc.
once cfcs are released into the atmosphere, they mix with the normal atmospheric gases and eventually reach the stratosphere. in the stratosphere, they get broken down by powerful uv radiations, releasing chlorine-free radicals.
the chlorine radicals then react with stratospheric ozone to form chlorine monoxide radicals and molecular oxygen.

the reaction of chlorine monoxide radical with atomic oxygen produces more chlorine radicals. the chlorine radicals are continuously regenerated and cause the breakdown of ozone. thus, cfcs are transporting agents for continuously generating chlorine radicals into the stratosphere and damaging the ozone layer.
in winter, a special type of cloud called polar stratospheric cloud is formed over antarctica.
these polar stratospheric clouds provide a surface on which chlorine nitrate formed gets hydrolyzed to form hypochlorous acid.
it also reacts with hydrogen chloride produced as per reaction (v) to give molecular chlorine.
when sunlight returns to antarctica in the spring, the sun's warmth breaks up the clouds, and hoci and c12 are photolyzed by sunlight.
the chlorine radicals thus formed, initiate the chain reaction for ozone depletion as described earlier.
