# Viscosity
- (5:24 PM)
- It is a resistance of a fluid to flow.
- By fluid we mean- Liquid or gas.
- [[honey]] is more viscous than water. Honey offers more resistance in flowing.
- If [[temperature]] increases, the Viscosity of gas     increases, and
						      the Viscosity of liquid decreases.  #doubt 
- If temperature decreases, the viscosity of [[blood]] increases, thereby the [[heart]] has to pump more blood, [[pressure]] on the heart increases, which might lead to heart failure.
- If temperature increases, the Viscosity of blood decreases, pressure on the heart decreases leading to a normal condition.
