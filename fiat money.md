it's a govemment-issued currency that is not backed by a commodity such as gold.
it gives central banks greater control over economy  b/c they cn control how
much money is printed.

hyperinflation.
fiat money, in a broad sense, is all kinds of money that are made legal tender by a
govemment decree or fiat. 
term is, however, usually reserved for legal-tender paper money or coins that have face
values far exceeding their commodity values & are not redeemable in gold or silver.
fiat currency or "real currency," "real money," or "national currency' is distinguished from
virtual currency or digital currency.
it's coin & paper money of a country that is designated as its legal tender.
while digital currency means a digital representation of either virtual currency (non-
fiat) or e-money (fiat) & thus is often used interchangeably with term "virtual
currency".
