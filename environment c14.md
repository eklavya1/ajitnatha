(4:02 PM)

Explained with the help of the handout.
Methods for Waste Management
Landfill 
Incineration - It is controlled high-temperature oxidation (burning/thermal treatment) of primarily organic compounds that produce thermal energy, CO2 and water. 
Pyrolysis - solid is converted into liquid state and liquid is converted into gas. 
Gasification - The material to be treated is directly converted into SynGas (synthetic gas) which has hydrogen and carbon dioxide as its components. 
Bioremediation
Hazardous Waste (Management & Handling Rules, 2019
Single permission for authorization pan India.
Stringent environmental compliance - SOP, and guidelines-based approach for permission.
