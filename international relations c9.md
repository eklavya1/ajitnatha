international relations class 09

class started at 1:35 pm

a brief review of last class (1:37 pm)

india - nepal relations(1:40 pm)
india - nepal relations(1:40 pm)

unprecedented closeness in india nepal relations is  b/c their relations are largely governed by people to people ties.

challenges in india -nepal relation -(2:15 pm)
challenges in india -nepal relation -(2:15 pm)

india doesn't have independent foreign policy wrt to nepal.
india's nepal policy is a subset of china's policy.
it's so  b/c of india's deep-seated insecurity viz a viz china.
india former pm jawahar lal nehru who emphasized principles of sovereign equality, non-interference in domestic affairs, even had no hesitation to declare in indian parliament on 6th december 1950 that india's security would enjoy primacy over nepal's sovereignty.
india,  b/c of its deep-seated insecurity against expansionist china cannot accept policy of equidistance of nepal.
nepal has to prioritize its relations with india.
thus india has sought to micromanage affairs in nepal.
following chinese annexation of tibet, india sought nepal to become its buffer state to prevent china's unimpeded access to india & its northern plains.
but nepal (1) is too large a country -45th in size; twice size of sri lanka - to become a vassal state.
(2) proud of its anti-colonial history to become any other country's vassal state.
vassal state- a state whose political sovereignty lies with some other state.
nepal is uniquely located b/w 2 asian giants china-india.
founder of nepal prithvi narayan shah described nepal as yam b/w 2 boulders.
nepal for long has tried to utilize its unique geostrategic position to pursue diversified foreign policy.
other reasons -
 political volatility-it has prevented india from developing a coherent nepal policy.
there have been 4 constitutions & 2 interim constitutions since 1950s.
nepal's polity has been polarised & consequently, india followed a multi-pillared policy as a result, india could not gain trust of any section within nepal's polity.
lack of professionalism in india's approach- most indian ambassadors to nepal have been from state of up & bihar.
 they have shared cross-border kinship relations & thus failed to present a neutral picture of ground realities in nepal.
 failure of india to follow diplomatic protocols for instance - treaty of peace & friendship b/w india & nepal was signed b/w nepali pm & indian ambassador hurting nepal's self-respect.
 india looks at 21st century nepal through 19th century colonial prism: as a buffer state with limited sovereignty.
india utilizes its resources to support individuals who can serve as indian stooges rather than build democratic institutions.
this generates ill-faith against india serve as indian stooges for micro-managing affairs in nepal & political instability does not augur well for india-nepal relations.

various bilateral issues (2:56 pm)
various bilateral issues (2:56 pm)

treaty of peace & friendship (1950) -since mid 19th century tibet has served as india's buffer against china.
role of buffer state passed on to nepal after chinese annexation of tibet.
it became imperative for new delhi to deny china direct access to india's vulnerable gangetic plains.
nepal had sought a continuance of sp relations it had with british india through this treaty which provide for open borders & right of nepali nationals to work in india.
break at 3:06 pm to 3:28 pm

treaty of peace & friendship - provisions (3:29 pm)
treaty of peace & friendship - provisions (3:29 pm)
india recognizes nepal as a sovereign state.
national treatment to each other's citizens in terms of employment including public employment.
india has relinquished its right to public sector employment.
nepal will give primacy to india in infrastructure development for instance - hydroelectric power projects.
problems are not a consequence of treaty rather with provisions of secret letters that were exchanged along with treaty.
1. both india & nepal shall not tolerate any act of aggression against 1 another.
2. nepal shall not import arms from any 3rd country without india's permission provided india is unable to fulfill nepal's requirement.
nepal's criticism-(3:35 pm)
1. it violates nepal's sovereignty.
2. it allows for new delhi interference in internal affairs of nepal esp with foreign & defense policy.
this treaty was signed by new delhi by nepal's ranas who didn't enjoy public support in nepal & therefore this treaty lacked legitimacy.
india gets disproportionate benefits from this treaty.

way  forward -(3:40 pm)
way  forward -(3:40 pm)
nepal wants revision of this treaty.
in 2014 during pm modi's visit to nepal, both india & nepal agreed to review, adjust & upgrade treaty.
subsequently, india- nepal eminent person group was established to look into issue.
it has finalized its report suggesting a revision of certain provisions of treaty.
however, report has not yet been officially adopted.
issue of revision of treaty was once again raised during 6th joint commission in 2021. (it's highest level mechanism to discuss bilateral issues b/w 2 countries.
it was established in 1987 & co-chaired by foreign ministers of 2 countries.
india & nepal should undertake necessary revision of treaty to build bilateral trust.

hydro-electric power issues- (3:51 pm)
hydro-electric power issues- (3:51 pm)
hep potential of nepal is 83000 mw.
at current level of technological developments, hep feasible is 4000 mw.
this is  b/c nepal is reluctant to work with india for hydro power generation.
as a result, nepal faces severe & long power cuts.(12-16 hours /day).
nepal grievances -(3:55 pm)
it alleges india plans large dams-based hep projects.
and such dams are geologically & ecologically harmful as nepal is located in seismically active zones.
india insists that nepal should give primacy to its over development of hep in line with 1950 treaty.
but nepal wants to issue open tenders for such projects so that other countries can participate & help in better price discovery.
failure of goi to complete hep power projects in time.
india-nepal hydropower cooperation stands in stark contrast to such cooperation b/w india & bhutan.
india & bhutan are eg of win-win economic diplomacy whereby through indian grants & soft loans bhutan develops its hep power plants.
power generated from these power plants after being utilized by bhutan is exported to india.
surplus power forms 1 of primary items in bhutan's export basket & is a major source of bhutan's revenue.
surplus power is sold to india at subsidized rates.
in fact, nepal under oli govt rejected usa's mcc grant which sought o upgrade nepal's electricity transmission system & connected it to indian power grid.

steps were taken (4:10 pm)
steps were taken (4:10 pm)
under modi govt, india & nepal have entered into a power trading agreement that allows joint investment in infrastructure building, marketing, & establishment of transmission lines.
pm modi's mantra for nepal is "hit" which stands for highways, information gateways, & transmission lines.
anti- india attitude is visible in lack of progress in game-changing 5000 mw pancheswar hep.

territorial dispute (4:15 pm)
territorial dispute (4:15 pm)
origin of dispute-it's traced to treaty of saugali b/w british india & nepal.
this treaty mentioned river kali to demarcate western borders of state of nepal.
therefore any territory to east of river kali will be part of nepal while any territory west of river kali will belong to india.
dispute b/w india - nepal is  b/c of a lack of consensus on origin of river kali.
acc to india river, kali originates in spring in lipulek.
while acc to nepal river's origin lies at limpiyadhura, northwest of lipulekh.

way forward (4:40 pm)
way forward (4:40 pm)
kala pani region is strategically vital since it's located at height of 20,000 feet & serves as a military observation post since 1962.
however, given importance of india- nepal relations & determination in india- china relations foll border clashes it has become all more essential to resolve bilateral territorial dispute at earliest.
political experts have cautioned that dispute is left unresolved will be sooner or later exploited by 3rd parties to their advantage (china).
kalapani dispute is almost a perfect mirror case of 2017 dokhlam crisis b/w china & bhutan in which india got involved.
therefore sooner india resolves this dispute with nepal lesser chances for china to get involved.
historical, technical, & cartographic claims will probably lead to competing interpretations & non-resolution of dispute.

suggestions - (4:49 pm)
suggestions - (4:49 pm)
1. in keeping with gujral, doctrine india should recognize region to be part of nepali territory on condition that nepal permanently leases out this territory to india for its military posts.
2. some form of co-management or shared sovereignty for dispute - joint deployment of military & police forces as during 1960s on nepal china border.
3. given trade potential both countries can consider establishing a sp economic zone.
conclusion -
driven by pragmatism, india & nepal should try & come out with out-of-box practical solution.
they could lead way to liberate sub-continent from territorial logic of sovereignty.

topic for next class - neighbourhood relations.
