# official notes
## bengal (01:00 pm).
it was a subah.
it included orissa, bengal, bihar.
### main actor=murshid quli khan (1717-27):
([[1717]]-27)
- diwan of bengal (collector of revenue administration) since [[1700]].
- known for efficient revenue administration.
- last governor of bengal who was appointed by mughal emperor i.e. mqushid quli khan established dynastic rule in bengal (post [[1717]]).
- he never declared independence from mughal empire b/c he wanted legitimacy.
- however, he continued to send revenue to delhi regularly.
- a regime of murshid quli khan-
- revenue administration of murshid quli khan- he relied on a limited number of intermediary zamindars for revenue collection (which will lead to ease of land revenue collection). these izs coerced primary zamindars to par revenue on time. over time these izs became very powerful i.e. by [[1727]], 50% of revenue was collected by only izs. mqk did detailed land surveys i.e. land revenue demand wasn't arbitrary & was based on parameters like productivity of soil, weather conditions, irrigation facilities, pat history of land revenue paid, etc.
- he punished zamindars to resisted land revenue demand.
- he took over jagirs of tankha jagirdars in bengal & shifted them to orissa i.e. he is removing political opposition.
- during mqk, there was a rise of strong bankers who helped in strengthening trade & revenue collection.
- trade= bankers gave loans to merchants allowing smooth conduct of trade. they secured transactions at each stage, ∴, enabled smooth conduct of trade. gave loans to zamindars so they cn pay land revenue in time, ∴, helped in timely collection of revenue. some bankers became so powerful, for ex, jagat seths, who got right to mint coins in bengal.
- agrarian productivity increased.
- trade also increased.
- hierarchy-
- murshid quli khan ([[1717]]-27)--> shuda-ud-din md. khan ([[1727]]-39)--> sarfaraz khan ([[1739]]-40)--> overthrown by alivardi khan ([[1740]]-56).
### alivardi khan-
- he was war commander of [[bengal]].
- he developed alliance with jagat seth & jagat seth supported coup de tat by alivardi khan.
- alivardi khan wrote to md. shah "allow me to overthrow sarfaraz khan & i will give you 1 crore rupees & all personal 
- wealth of sarfaraz" & md. shah agreed.
- it was during time of alivardi khan that virtual break of bengal with mughal empire happened as now officials were appointed by alivardi khan without reference/approval of mughal emperor. also, gradually money sent to delhi, money or revenue was now not sent to delhi regularly.
- from [[1745]]-[[1751]], marathas attacked bengal continuously. finally, in [[1751]], alivardi khan agreed to de facto control of marathas in orissa & marathas also got 'chauth' of bengal & bihar i.e. 1/4th share of revenue.
- maratha attacks decreased overland trade & this boosted oceanic trade conducted by european companies. thus, during time of alivardi khan, there was a massive increase in european trade.
- alivardi also benefited monetarily on account of this rise in european trade.

### consolidation of power-
- majority of population was hindu, so, he adopted a religiously tolerant policy.
- converted tankha jagirs into watan jagirs to win favors of imp sections. ∴, military aristocracy supported him.
- he also gave mansabs i.e. official role was given to men of finance like merchants, money lenders, bankers.
- ∴, character of bureaucracy changed in hyderabad- watan jagirs are not prominent in mansabdary system & rise of men of finance.
- no arbitrary taxes, ∴, merchants were happy & supported.
- war of succession after death of cqk b/w nasir jung ([[1748]]-50) & muzaffar jung (ruler for only 3 months i.e. [[1750]]-51)-->salabat jung ([[1751]]-62)--> nizam ali khan ([[1762]]- [[1806]]).
