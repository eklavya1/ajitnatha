	- Indian conception of the world ruler, derived from the Sanskrit chakra, “wheel,” and vartin, “one who turns.” Thus, a chakravartin [[may]] be understood as a ruler “whose chariot wheels roll everywhere,” or “whose movements are unobstructed.”
	- Buddhist and Jain sources distinguish three types of [[secular]] chakravartin: chakravala chakravartin, a king who rules over all four of the [[continents]] posited by ancient Indian cosmography (i.e., a universal monarch); dvipa chakravartin, a ruler who governs only one of those [[continents]] and is, therefore, less powerful than the first; and pradesha chakravartin, a monarch who leads the people of only a part of a continent, the equivalent of a local king. The first reference to a [[secular]] king who achieved the status of a chakravala chakravartin appears in texts and monuments from the Mauryan [[dynasty]] that praise the exploits of King [[Ashoka]] (3rd century bce). Buddhist and Jain philosophers of this period conflated the notion of the universal monarch with the idea of a king of righteousness and maintainer of moral law. In Buddhism, for example, the chakravartin was considered to be the [[secular]] counterpart of a buddha (“enlightened one”), with whom he shared many attributes.

- CAKRAVARTIN is a Sanskrit noun referring to an ideal universal king who rules ethically and benevolently over the entire world. Derived from the Sanskrit cakra, "wheel," and vartin, "one who turns," the term cakravartin (Pali, cakkavatti ) in classical [[Hindu]] texts signifies that all-powerful monarch "whose chariot wheels turn freely" or "whose travels are unobstructed." Such a ruler's unsurpassed and virtuous rule is described as sarvabhauma ; it pertains to all creatures everywhere.
- Buddhist and Jain literatures describe their enlightened founders (the Buddha or Buddhas and the tīrthaṅkaras, respectively) in similar terms, the notion being that religious truth transcends local or national limitations and applies to all people everywhere.
- This idea is particularly evident in Buddhist oral and scriptural traditions, which frequently refer to Gautama as a `cakravāla cakravartin`, an illuminator of dharma (life in adherence to compassionate truth) in all regions of the world. From the symbol of the turning wheel, a sign of universal sovereignty, comes the description of the Buddha as dharmacakrapravartayati, "he who sets the wheel of law in motion," and thus the name of his first sermon, Dharmacakrapravartana Sūtra [[sutra]](Pali, Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta ; The sūtra on the turning forth of the wheel of dharma), in which the Buddha presents his insights into the Four Noble Truths. After his death in 480 bce, Gautama's followers cremated his body and enshrined his relics in a stupa, just as they would have done with a universal monarch.
- The general South Asian notion that the king was to have extensive rule dates at least as far back as the high Vedic era (1200–800 bce) and possibly to the centuries preceding. The Vedic ritual coronation of the king (Rājasūya), for example, was preceded by a ceremony in which a wild stallion was left to wander at will throughout the land for an entire year, at which time it was sacrificed in the important rite known as the Aśvamedha, and all of the territory it had covered in that year was held to be the king's domain. The actual term _cakravartin_ was known in the late fifth and early fourth centuries bce by the compilers of the _Maitri Upaniṣad_, who used the noun when listing the names of several kings who had renounced their royal prerogatives in favor of the life of ascetic contemplation (_Maitri Upaniṣad_ 1.4).
- Direct discussions of the cakravartin as an imperial ideal appear as early as Kauṭilya's Artha Śāstra [[chanakaya]] (c. 300 bce), a court manual of polity, diplomacy, economy, and social behavior. In his descriptions of the range of an emperor's influence (cakravarti-kśetra ), Kauṭilya notes that the king should undertake any task he feels will bring him and his people prosperity and that he should have power "from the Himalayas to the [[ocean]]." Kauṭilya [[may]] have had in mind the prestige and hopes of the first Mauryan king, Candragupta, who reigned from about 321 to 297 bce and whom Kauṭilya reportedly served as chief minister. Candragupta was perhaps the first ruler to unify all of the lands from the shores of the southern tip of India to the Himalayas in the north and the Kabul Valley in the northwest. Edicts and other lessons inscribed on pillars and cliffs describe the last Mauryan king, Aśoka (d. 238 bce?) as a cakravartin under whose patronage the Buddhist Dharma spread throughout South and [[Southeast Asia]]. Chroniclers in the courts of the Śātavāhana [[satavahanas]] emperors (first to second centuries ce) similarly defined their kingdoms as that world extending from the eastern, southern, and western oceans to the mountains. The Guptas, too, viewed themselves as the rulers of empires. Skandha [[Gupta]] I, who reigned from 455 to 467 ce, for example, is depicted in the Janagadh inscriptions (dated mid-fifth century ce) as a [[leader]] whose rule was the entire earth bounded by the four oceans and within which thrive several smaller countries. The Western Cāḷlukyas (sixth to eighth and tenth to twelfth centuries) described themselves as the emperors of the lands between the three seas, while the Vijayanagara rulers (fourteenth to seventeenth centuries) labeled themselves the masters of the eastern, western, southern, and northern seas.
- Thus the South Asian political imagination up to the seventeenth century generally included the ideal of a unified rule, and various kings have identified themselves as universal monarchs: hence the common royal titles samrāj ("supreme monarch," i.e., the one who rules over all princes and principalities), rājādhirāja ("king above kings"), ekarāja ("the only king"), parama-bhaṭṭārka ("most venerable lord"), disampati ("lord of the lands"), and digvijayin ("conqueror of the regions").
- Buddhist and Jain literatures have distinguished three types of cakravartin. A pradeśa cakravartin is a monarch who leads the people of a specific region and [[may]] be thought of as a local king. A dvīipa cakravartin governs all of the people of any one of the four [[continents]] (dvīipas, literally "islands") posited by ancient Indian cosmologies and is, accordingly, more powerful in the [[secular]] realm than the pradeśa cakravartin. Superior even to a dvīipa cakravartin, however, is the cakravāla cakravartin, the monarch who rules over all of the [[continents]] of the world. It is the political paramountcy of the cakravāla cakravartin with which the Buddha's religious supremacy is compared.
