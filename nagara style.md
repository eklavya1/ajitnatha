Nagara style: The style of temple architecture that became popular in northern India is known as nagara.
o In North India it is common for an entire temple to be built on a stone platform with steps leading up to it.
o Further, unlike in South India it does not usually have elaborate boundary walls or gateways.
o While the earliest temples had just one tower, or shikhara, later temples had several.
o The garbhagriha is always located directly under the tallest tower
There are many subdivisions of nagara temples depending on the shape of the shikhara.
## latina
'Latina' or the rekha-prasada type of shikara:
	The most common name for the simple shikhara which is square at the base and whose walls curve or slope inward to a point on top is called the 'latina' or the rekha-prasada type of shikara.
## phamsana
Phamsana buildings tend to be broader and shorter than latina ones.
	Their roofs are composed of several slabs that gently rise to a single point over the centre of the building, unlike the latina ones which look like sharply rising tall towers.
• Phamsana roofs do not curve inward, instead they slope upwards on a straight incline.
• In many North Indian temples you will notice that the phamsana design is used for the mandapas while the main garbhagriha is housed in a latina building. 
## Valabhi
• These are rectangular buildings with a roof that rises into a vaulted chamber. T
• edge of this vaulted chamber is rounded, like the bamboo or wooden wagons that would have been drawn by bullocks in ancient times.
• They are usually called 'wagonvaulted buildings'.

it is palpable in different parts of india with varied elaborations in different localities has two particular features.
first is presence of several graduated projections or rathakas in centre of all sides of square temple, thus bearing a cross shape with several re-entrant angles on all sides.
second feature includes design of spire or shikhara that follow principles of concentric squares & circles & gradually taper in a convex curve while stretching upwards.
kandariya mahadeva temple in khajuraho in madhya pradesh is a fine example of this style.

in north india, it is common for an entire temple to be built on a stone platform with steps leading up to it.
further, unlike in south india, it does not usually have elaborate boundary walls or gateways.
while earliest temples had just one tower or shikhara, later temples had several.
garbhagriha is always located directly under tallest tower.
there are many subdivisions of nagara temples depending on shape of shikhara.

there are different names for various parts of temple in different parts of india; however, most common name for simple shikhara which is square at base & whose walls curve or slope inward to a point on top is called 'latina' or rekha-prasada type of shikhara.

their roofs are composed of several slabs that gently rise to a single point over centre of building, unlike latina ones which look like sharply rising tall towers.

# subdivisions
there are many subdivisions of nagara temples depending on shape of shikhara.
there are different names for various parts of temple in different parts of india; however, most common name for simple shikhara which is square at the
base & whose walls curve or slope inward to a point on top is called 'latina' or rekha-prasada type of shikhara.
second major type of architectural form in nagara order is phamsana.
phamsana buildings tend to be broader & shorter than latina ones.
their roofs are composed of several slabs that gently rise to a single point over center of building, unlike latina ones which look like sharply rising tall towers.
phamsana roofs do not curve inward, instead, they slope upwards on a straight incline.
in many north indian temples, you will notice that phamsana design is used for mandapas while main garbhagriha is housed in a latina building. later on, latina buildings grew complex, & instead of appearing like a single tall tower, temple began to support many smaller towers, which were clustered together like rising mountain- peaks with tallest one being in center, & this was one which was always above garbhagriha.
third main sub-type of nagara building is what is generally called valabhi type.
these are rectangular buildings with a roof that rises into a vaulted chamber.
edge of this vaulted chamber is rounded, like bamboo or wooden wagons that would have been drawn by bullocks in ancient times.
they are usually called 'wagon vaulted buildings'.
as mentioned above, form of temple is influenced by ancient building forms that were already in existence before fifth century ce.
valabhi type of building was one of them.
for instance, if you study ground plan of many of buddhist rock-cut chaitya caves, you will notice that they are shaped as long halls which end in a curved back.
from inside, roof of this portion also looks like a wagon-vaulted roof.
