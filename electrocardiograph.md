An electrocardiograph is used to obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG).
ECG is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle.
To obtain a standard ECG, a patient is connected to the machine with three electrical leads (one to each wrist and the left ankle) that continuously monitor the heart activity.
For a detailed evaluation of the heart's function, multiple leads are attached to the chest region.
Each peak in the ECG is identified with a letter from P to T that corresponds to a specific electrical activity of the heart.
The P-wave represents the electrical excitation (or depolarization) of the atria, which leads to the contraction of both the atria.
The QRS complex represents the depolarization of the ventricles, which initiates ventricular contraction.
The contraction starts shortly after Q and marks the beginning of the systole.
The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from an excited to a normal state (repolarization).
The end of the T-wave marks the end of the systole.
Obviously, by counting the number of QRS complexes that occur in a given time period, one can determine the heartbeat rate of an individual.
Since the ECGs obtained from different individuals have roughly the same shape for a given lead configuration, any deviation from this shape indicates a possible abnormality or disease. Hence, it is of great clinical significance.
