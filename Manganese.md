![[pic manganese ore deposits of india.png]]
Manganese is an important raw material for the [[smelting]] of iron ore and is also used for manufacturing ferroalloys.
Manganese deposits are found in almost all geological formations, however, it is mainly associated with the Dharwar system.
[[odisha]] has the largest reserves of Manganese, whereas [[Madhya Pradesh]] is the leading manganese ore producing State accounted for 27% of the total [[production]] in 2016-17
and 32% in 2017-18.
State-wise, Odisha tops the total reserves/resources with 44% share followed by Karnataka 22%, Madhya Pradesh 12%, Maharashtra & Goa 7% each, Andhra Pradesh 4% and
Jharkhand 2%, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Telangana, and West Bengal together shared the remaining about 2% resources.
Major mines in Odisha are located in the central part of the iron ore belt of India, particularly in Bonai, Kendujhar, Sundergarh, Gangpur, Koraput, Kalahandi, and Bolangir.
[[karnataka]] is another major producer and here the mines are located in Dharwar, Ballari, Belagavi, North Canara, Chikkmagaluru, Shivamogga, Chitradurga, and Tumakuru.
[[Maharashtra]] is also an important producer of manganese, which is mined in Nagpur, Bhandara, and Ratnagiri districts.
The disadvantage to these mines is that they are located far from steel plants.
The manganese belt of Madhya Pradesh extends in a belt in Balaghat-Chhindwara-Nimar-Mandla and Jhabua districts.
Telangana, Goa, and Jharkhand are other minor producers of manganese.
About 90 to 95% of the world's production of manganese ore is used in the metallurgy of iron and steel.
A high amount of phosphorous makes the manganese ore unsuitable for its metallurgical use, whereas, high phosphorous and high iron content makes it unsuitable for the battery industry.
