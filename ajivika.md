- Ajivikas is an ascetic sect founded by Makkali Gosala, a contemporary of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, and of Mahavira, the last and 24th Tirthankara of Jainism. Thus, Ajivika sect emerged in India about the same time as Buddhism and Jainism. 
- It advocates total determinism and rejects the doctrine of karma. It held that the affairs of the entire universe were ordered by a cosmic force called niyati that determined all events, including an individual’s fate, to the last detail and that barred personal efforts to change or accelerate improvement toward one’s spiritual destiny.
- The Barabar Caves are the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India, mostly dating from the Mauryan Empire (322–185 BCE), some with Ashokan inscriptions, located in the Bela Ganj Block of Gaya district Bihar, India, 24 km north of Gaya. The caves were gifted by Ashoka to ascetics from the Ajivika sect.
