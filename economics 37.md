## overview of import substitution & liberalization, privatization, globalization (LPG) reforms
9:23 am
- most of asian economies followed [[import substitution]] model by restricting foreign competition in mid-[[20th century]].
- by [[1960]]s & 70‘s, [[japan]], [[south korea]], [[china]], etc. had started to shift to [[export]] promotion model, wch [[india]] could start to shift to after [[1991]].
- we had followed strict import controls & [[government]]-controlled [[currency]] conversion rates.

## public-private partnerships (PPPs): explanation
- public-private partnerships (ppps): explanation 9:42 am
- it's [[investment]] strategy & contract b/w public & private sectors to provide public good.
- responsibility of providing public good is that of govt as private sector cannot provide public goods.
- private parties cn charge fr providing public services to consumers.
- ppp contracts are aka *concessional agreements*.

### build operate transfer (BOT) model: explanation
9:52 am
[[elon musk]] ??
- private partner brings all [[resource]]s (hence practically assumes all risks) & expertise fr project.
- govt will get timely clearances fm diff ministries & departments.
- land acquisition is biggest challenge of most [[infrastructure]] projects.
- even fr central gvt projects (DMIC, dfc, etc.), land acquisition is done by state gvts.
- pvt sector will operate & earn rev fr specified period, after wch built project will be transferred to gvt.

- some issues with bot contract
	- as govt has nt incurred any expense, it does nt bear any risk.
	- [[government]] cn hence be complacent fr its part of agreement- acquiring land fr non-agricultural use.
	- delays cause cost overruns through higher interest payments.
	- gvt is very less likely to seek revenue fm infrastructure fr public goods.
	- b/c of excessive litigations & [[dereliction]]s fm both gvt & private sides, BOT model is now discontinued.

### engineering procurement & construction (EPC)
- engineering procurement & construction (epc) :explanation(10:38 am):
- [[iron man]] [[=next 100 years book]]
- unlike BOT, in EPC entire expense is borne by govt.
- private partner collects contract fee & has responsibility of [[engineering]] project, procuring materials, & undertaking construction.
- due to budget constraints, nature of projects is usually smaller.
- big [[infrastructure]] companies usually don’t get involved with them as reward (contract fee) is nt very lucrative.

### hybrid annuity model (HAM)
- contribution is made by both private & public partners.
- it will be primary model in planned national [[investment]] pipeline.
- reward is given in parts- usually, govt brings initial 40% of costs.
- this results in commencement of operations & boosts confidence of private partners.
- rewards to private partner will be given on annualized/timely basis & it would've variable component as per performance of pvt partner (to ensure quality of work).

## investment models
[[investment]] models (11:00 am)

- *[[investment]] models are strategies of investing (utilizing) limited resources to maximize output that cn be generated fm them.*
- govt’s decisions on [[investment]]s are based on multiple considerations responsibilities & limitations, wch many times may even be in conflict with each other.
- for ex - decision to invest in space technology may be seen to be at odds with its duty to provide fr vulnerable sections.
- as such [[investment]] decisions are both necessary awa responsibility- present requirements & future challenges.
- nobel laureate economist lewis suggested that country that has unlimited supply of labor should invest in labor-intensive industries so that it cn remain competitive with respect to others.
- harrod-domar suggested increasing [[saving]]s by households so that easy money cn be made available to private sector fr [[investment]], & hence [[incremental capital output ratio]] (ICOR) will reduce & [[economy]] will become mr competitive. --> [[harrod-domar model]]
- it was modified to be implemented in india by [[pc mahalanobis]] & [[jawaharlal nehru]].
- since there were no household savings in [[india]], private [[investment]] would be limited, & thus responsibility of [[investment]] was assumed to be that to govt.
- govt would invest in heavy industry & produce [[capital]] goods, thereby making them available to consumer goods industry wch could meet domestic demands.

## public-private partnership (ppp)
- in modern times, [[investment]] is nt solely by govt, but by private sector as well.
- govt & private sector resources & expertise are leveraged in manner that public goods cn be provided mr efficiently.
- partnership contract is based on arrangement that allows user of public goods, to pay fr them & thus compensate private sector fr its [[investment]]s.

- any contract b/w 2 parties has 4 ingredients that are divided b/w each of them -

- **resources**
- contribution by each party- govt & private.
- risks to be borne by each party dur implementation of contracts.
- risks do nt end with completion & maybe there with operation as well.
- **responsibilities**
- each party is responsible fr some tasks wch are divided clearly b/w them in contract.
- **rewards**
- they are benefits arising out of successful completion b/w parties.
#doubt where is 4th point ?????????

### types of ppp contracts
#### build operate & transfer
- resources are contributed by private sector, while responsibilities are of both govt & private.
- since resources are brought by private, risk is essentially that of private sector only, & so is reward.
- *BOT contracts are lucrative, & thus private sector involvement is usually encouraging.*
- however, since risk is completely that of private sector whereas responsibilities are of both, there are frequent disputes.
- most commonly this pertains to non-performance of 1 or other responsibility & nt clearly defined risk.
- *as such these contracts have lot of litigation involved & thus are nt ultimately encouraging fr private sector participation.*

### engineering procurement & construction (EPC)
- ak/a *turnkey contracts*.
- entire resources are brought by govt, & thus their probability of successful completion is high.
- however, since govt resources are spread thin, nt much cn be allocated under such projects.
- further, private sector only gets contract fee & ∴ reward is nt that lucrative.

### hybrid annuity model (ham)
- [[military industrial complex]] [[youtube whatifalthist]] [[=The Pentagon's Brain - Annie Jacobsen]] [[department of defense]] [[=the department of mad scientists]]
- resources are contributed by both govt & private sector.
- govt contribution gives encouragement to private sector.
- reward is paid on fixed & variable basis in annualized manner.
- variable component is fr ensuring timely & quality completion of project.
- annualized payments are fr ensuring that private sector's involvement is continuous.
- in HAM, toll collection rights are with govt through NHAIMama Poster.

### swiss challenge model
11: 23 am
#doubt 
- method in wch unsolicited proposal fr govt project is received by private party.
- later allows 3rd party to challenge original proposal via open bidding, to eventually settle fr most advantageous/most competitive offer.
- will be commonly used fr mining projects after new mining policy.

### schumpeter's model
- seeks to identify where does growth comes fm in [[economy]] so that focus areas or resources (raw materials/manpower) cn be identified.
- nxt stage of [[growth]] will come fm mr efficient use of resources, & nt merely by mr quantity of resources, through technological impr. [[iron man]]
- in 3rd stage of growth, when technological barriers fr efficiency are experienced, [[innovation]] must [[power]] growth.
- driven by exporting technology, adding value to products, etc.
- *most of countries get stuck after 1st growth when advantage of natural resources starts waning off.* --> #wo_de like that undershirt advertisement of shah rukh khan, "*many reach top, few manage to stay there*"
