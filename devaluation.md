Select the correct answer using the code given below.
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3
ans - c
	- Devaluating a currency is decided by the government issuing the currency, and unlike depreciation, is not the result of non-governmental activities.
	-   **Increased Aggregate Demand ([[AD]]) -** Exports become cheaper and more competitive to foreign buyers. Higher exports relative to imports can increase aggregate demand as increased consumer spending on domestic goods and services.
	-   **Inflation is more likely to occur** because imports are more expensive causing cost push inflation, AD is increasing causing demand pull [[inflation]] and with exports becoming cheaper manufacturers may have less incentive to cut costs and become more efficient. Therefore over time, costs [[may]] increase.
	-   **Improvement in the current account balance.** With exports more competitive and imports more expensive, we may see higher exports and lower imports, which will reduce the current account deficit.
