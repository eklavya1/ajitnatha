[[latitude]]
- Countries having large longitudinal spread can adopt several time zones. Like [[mod his 26|Russia]] which extends through almost 1650 of [[latitude]] is divided into eleven time zones. Similarly, USA and Canada are divided into five time zones.
- Countries with large latitudinal spread but limited longitudinal spread may adopt single time zone. Like India, which spreads across almost 300 [[latitude]] has adopted a single time zone. It has adopted 82.50 east for the standard time which is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time.
- A country with very small latitudinal or longitudinal expanse may have large altitudinal variations.
- [[Location]] of a country with respect to [[equator]] does not have any correlation with adoption of multiple time zones. One country in the Arctic zone [[arctic 海洋]][[may]] adopt single time zone if its longitudinal spread is small.
