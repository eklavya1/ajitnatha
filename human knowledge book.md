This living hypertext is a systematic statement of what humanity does and does not know, and can and
cannot know, about the answers to these and hundreds of other such questions. It summarizes the
foundations and limits of what human civilization has learned, identifying for each subdivision of
human knowledge its fundamental concepts, principles, mysteries, and misunderstandings. It asserts a
worldview of naturalistic positivism and libertarian capitalism that it predicts will guide future human

0.1. Prologue / Definition
This living hypertext is a systematic summary of the knowledge attained by human civilization. For
each subdivision of human knowledge, the text identifies its fundamental concepts, principles,
mysteries, and misunderstandings.
Status. This draft contains
● a complete section on philosophy;
● a complete section on futurology;
● partially complete sections on logic and physics;
● a complete section on economics;
● some notes and tables on astronomy, biology, political science, linguistics, and history;
● over 1500 internal hypertext links.
A more detailed indication of what parts of the text have been completed is provided by the hypertext
links in the Questions Asked section.
Copyright. This text is the copyrighted property of the author. Certain forms of copying are permitted
and even encouraged; see the Copyright section for details.
0.2. Prologue / Assertions
Positions
This text aims to assert humanity's analyses and theories that are most valid (i.e. convincing and
defensible, as opposed to merely logically well-formed). These analyses and theories are not
necessarily the most widely-believed or well-known. Potentially contentious assertions are those
sympathetic to ontological materialism, epistemological empiricism and positivism, mental
functionalism, theological atheism, axiological extropianism, political libertarianism, economic
capitalism, constitutional federalism, biological evolutionism, and technological optimism.
Relatively uncontentious assertions appear as normal text. Potentially contentious assertions
appear like this. Denials of widely-held beliefs appear like
this.Questions whose answers lie outside human knowledge appear like this.
Innovations
Almost all of the facts and analyses asserted in this text have of course been asserted before by other
humans. Nevertheless, there are some things in this text that the author believes may be novel or at
least independently original.
Arrangements. The text places various unoriginal pieces of information into some arrangements that
might not have been presented elsewhere before. Among these are
● a list of humanity's most important questions;
● a list of humanity's most important unanswered questions;
● a taxonomy of paranormal phenomena;
● a summary of arguments against the Bible;
● a synopsis of where and how fast Earth is heading in space;
● lists of major biological and historical advances;
● summaries of the platforms of the major American political parties; and
● an extension of the classical Libertarian 2D map of political space.
Analyses. The text gives certain analyses and definitions that, while not wildly original, are
nevertheless believed by the author to be improvements on any he had seen before. Among these are
● a definition and taxonomy of living systems;
● a definition of property and the principles of rightful ownership;
● a stipulation of the conditions for the continuity of identity;
● a definition of natural monopoly;
● a self-referential definition of the universe; and
definitions of existence, time, meaning, consciousness, volition, intelligence, wisdom, and
person.
● 
Inventions. The text presents a few notions that may be wholly new. They are
● the idea of memeware;
● the idea that without quantum indeterminacy one could in principle store unlimited amounts of
information within a finite medium;
the idea that the question "why is there something rather than nothing?" might be answered by a
combination of anthropic reasoning and the observation that it is not possible for nothing to be
possible.
● 
Predictions. The section on Futurology collects, filters, and refines many predictions by other
humans, but also makes predictions that the author has never seen clearly stated by anyone else. They
are predictions of
● humanity's three remaining technological revolutions;
● heat pollution as any planet's ultimate limiter of population and development;
● asymptotic limits on the development of economic and military systems;
● limits preventing runaway intelligence and productivity; and
● technology allowing perfect forgery and invasion of physical privacy.
Judgments. The author naturally hopes that the most significant innovation of this text is the
judgments it makes and the worldview it synthesizes them into. The text asserts a worldview it calls
autocosmology that includes by endorsement the positions of positivism, empiricism, functionalism,
atheism, capitalism, federalism, evolutionism, and evolutionary psychology. The text also advances as
part of autocosmology some slightly customized versions of other positions. They are
● a materialist ontology that attempts to build from logic to events to causality to existence;
an extropian axiology that values life and intelligence and the autonomy needed to increase
them;
● 
a libertarian ethics that recognizes all persons' right to life and liberty, and all beings' right not to
suffer torture or extinction;
● 
a libertarian political philosophy that sharply defines the duties, powers, and limits of the state;
and
● 
a futuristic optimism that predicts increasing liberty and prosperity and decreasing ignorance and
superstition.
● 
0.3. Prologue / Scope
This text aims to survey the foundations and limits of the knowledge attained by humanity since the
dawn of civilization. It does not bother restating what Stone Age humans already knew or what now
constitutes common sense and folk wisdom. It does not include operational knowledge about using
humanity's technologies or natural faculties. It does not include parochial knowledge about human
practices and achievements in art, play, and subsistence. It does not include subjects (such as astrology
and psychoanalysis) that do not constitute valid knowledge. It does not simply enumerate facts and
ideas alphabetically. It is neither a compendium of trivia nor an almanac of ephemera. It does not
attempt to correct or improve the reader's command of any particular human language. It does not try
merely to fill the common or embarrassing gaps in people's knowledge. It is not a syllabus of cultural
literacy for some particular human society. It is not a guide to understanding but rather a survey of
what is to be understood. It does not give demonstrations but rather conclusions. It does not attempt to
persuade or teach but rather to assert and inform. It aims to systematically and assertively summarize
what humanity does and does not know.
0.4. Prologue / Organization
There are many equally valid ways to organize human knowledge. Knowledge can be organized
according to
● the time when it was attained;
● the place where it was attained;
● the techniques with which it was attained;
● the domain to which it applies;
● the purposes for which it is used;
● the names of its topics;
● the thinkers who created it;
● the writings that first recorded it.
This text organizes human knowledge according to the domain to which it applies, and orders these
domains roughly from the most universal to the most parochial. This text begins with philosophy,
because philosophy addresses the fundamental and ultimate questions about what exists, what we
know, and what we value. Philosophy is about the questions that would confront thinkers not only on
any world in the universe but on any world in any possible universe. If philosophy is about necessary
questions, then mathematics is about necessary answers: the rules of inference and the necessary
deductions that all thinkers in all possible universes must acknowledge.
Science is about truth that is not necessary but rather contingent, because it is based on actual
observations and inductions about regular or pattern-following phenomena in the universe. The truths
of science should be agreed upon by any thinkers in the universe that observe the same regular
phenomena. The most interesting known phenomena in the universe are those concerning persons, and
so science is divided accordingly. Natural science studies regular phenomena that do not necessarily
involve persons and thus are likely to be universal (although many details of terrestrial life science are
inevitably parochial). Technology applies mathematics and science toward accomplishing goals.
Technological principles are likely to coincide wherever in the universe there are thinkers dealing with
similar phenomena and desiring similar goals. Social sciences strive to induce truths that would apply
to any kind of person anywhere in the universe, but this is not always possible because humans know
of only one kind of person: humans. Most parochial of all would be topics relating to human arts and
leisure, which this text excludes as not involving fundamental knowledge.

0.6. Prologue / Audience
A summary of the knowledge and ignorance of human civilization could be useful to many.
Students could use it to gauge how much they have left to learn, and how a given piece of
knowledge fits in with all the rest.
● 
Teachers could use it to show the relationships among the various parts of human knowledge. It
could also help them audit how well their course plans cover fundamentals, and help them
prepare tests for achievement of basic understanding.
● 
● Colleges could use it as a model report required to be written by graduating students.
Educated people could use it to help correct any areas of forgetfulness, incompleteness, or
obsolescence in their education.
● 
People building systems of knowledge or opinion could use it as an example of how to address
the important and fundamental areas of human knowledge.
● 
Investigators could use its compilation of mysteries to choose a research area available for

0.8. Prologue / Authority
No statements should be believed or disbelieved simply because they are offered by a particular text or
author. The statements in this text are no exception. They should be judged only by whether they are
consistent with evidence, logic, parsimony, and other truth. Even if most of the assertions in this text
are valid (i.e. convincing and defensible), that is not strong evidence that none could be invalid.
The number of possible valid human knowledge summaries no longer than this text is immense but
finite. This text is certainly far from being the best possible such summary. If the goal of approaching
such an optimal summary is worthwhile, then an effective method might be to first produce a
suboptimal summary and then to continually correct it or replace it outright with better ones. Thus
corrections and replacements of this text are welcome.
At the end of this text is a list of some of the references used in writing it. Because this text attempts to
say so much, it contains few references for particular statements. The text tries to explain or justify
some of its statements, but most it merely asserts, due to space constraints.
Words in single-quotes are being mentioned rather than used. ('Ten' is a word, while ten is a number.)
Words in double-quotes are being used verbatim from some source. Words in italics are being used
with emphasis. Words in bold and used at the beginning of a sentence are being defined.
0.9. Prologue / Criticism
Many criticisms of this text are predictable.
Some will find parts of this compendium uninteresting. The author hopes the text will reawaken
their childhood curiosity about the big questions, and tap their adult capacity for marvel at what
humanity knows and does not know. Aristotle or Newton would probably each have given his
right eye for access to the knowledge that most modern humans choose to ignore.
● 
Some will note that while the author is known for his sense of humor, there is no humor in this
text. The author believes that humor would be inappropriate in what is essentially a reference
work. There are probably funny lexicographers, but you wouldn't know it by reading a
dictionary.
● 
Some will say this text has too many definitions and reads like a dictionary. A large part of
knowledge is indeed analysis: the carving of nature at the joints.
● 
Some will say this text has too few definitions, in that it uses too many academic or obscure
words. For the sake of brevity, this text indeed takes full advantage of the vocabulary of English.
● 
Some will regard the text as grandiose or presumptuous. An assertive summary of human
knowledge is necessarily grand in scope and must presume to make judgments. However, the
reader should not mistake terseness for any claim to authority or certitude.
● 
Some will not like the way the text organizes and partitions knowledge. There are many useful
ways to organize knowledge, but a linear text can only choose one.
● 
Some will quibble with the relative emphasis the text gives to certain subjects. A text this broad
must give incomplete treatment to any topic it covers.
● 
Some will argue that the text offers few new ideas. The text strives for truth and not mere
novelty. Few (if any) of the ideas in this text may be original, but their systematic assertion may
be unprecedented.
● 
Some will consider the text simplistic. As long as it is appropriately categorical and not false or
misleading, simplicity will be its virtue and not its vice.
● 
Some will note that the text does not justify many of its assertions. Indeed, this text necessarily
devotes its space to conclusions rather than demonstrations, describing the destination and not
the path.
● 
Some will disagree with the text's assertions. Reality and history will determine which assertions
are true and which are not. The truths advanced in this text may not find widespread
acknowledgment in the author's lifetime. But as these truths prevail over the third millennium's
first century or two, historians will have trouble (as did the author) finding a prior exposition of
the emerging worldview that the text identifies and summarizes.
● 
Some will claim that no valid summary of human knowledge is possible, and that knowledge is
subjective to the knower or relative to the context. Such mysticism and cynical relativism can be
refuted only by the objective regularity of the universe itself. This objective regularity is the
reason why science works.
● 
● Some will question the authority or motivation of the author. Indeed, the qualifications and
intentions of an author should never be exempt from questioning. However, the truth or falsity of
each (non-self-referential) statement in the text is nevertheless independent of who wrote it, no
matter how hard some might wish otherwise.
Some will say that this text, so full of second-hand facts and personal judgments, is and will be
of no importance. They likely are correct about the text, but not about the worldview it identifies
and summarizes.
● 
The most welcome way to criticize this text would be to offer an improved or alternative summary of
human knowledge, one just as comprehensive and just as assertive. Even more welcome would be
vigorous competition between knowledge-summarizing treatises representing humanity's various
contradictory schools of thought. These efforts would in effect "sequence" the most important human
memes and their alleles, constituting a sort of Human Memome Project. Such a competition would
preserve a fossil record of dying worldviews even as it hastens what the author believes will be the
inevitable ascendancy of naturalistic positivism and libertarian capitalism.
0.10. Prologue / Motivation
I began writing this text in order to add to, clarify and preserve what I know and believe. I had never
found a single writer with whom I agreed along all the major dimensions of human opinions. But I was
surprised I also could not find a single text that systematically summarizes what humanity knows.
Encyclopedias are too meek, seeking universal consensus and to alphabetize instead of analyze. 
Textbooks are too narrow, mapping individual trees and not the forest. Most treatises are too mystical
or canonical, substituting intuition or revelation for skeptical rationality. None of them seems to well
capture the worldview emerging from the revolutions in physics and biology and from the successes of
free markets and free minds. I believe that a worldview of scientific positivism and libertarian
capitalism will prevail in human thought and action in the new millennium. Such a future will be good,
and I hope to advance it in some small way with this text.

1. Metaphysics: the study of ultimate reality.
2. Epistemology: the study of knowledge.
3. Axiology: the study of values.
Necessary Questions
Philosophy asks the questions:
● What is existing?
● What is knowing?
● What is good?
The first two questions face anyone who cares to distinguish the real from the unreal and the true from
the false. The third question faces anyone who makes any decisions at all, and even not deciding is
itself a decision. Thus all persons practice philosophy whether they know it or not.
Autocosmic Answers
What is existing? Reality consists ultimately of matter and energy and their fundamentally
lawlike and unwilled relations in space-time. To exist is to have a causal relationship with the
rest of the universe. The universe is the maximal set of circumstancesthat includes this
statement and no subset of which is causally unrelated to the remainder. Humans do not
know why the universe exists or what it is for. The universe operates without supernatural
intervention and according to lawlike regularities that can be understood through empirical
investigation and without special intuition. Humans have no credible evidence of any
supernatural agency or unity. Humans have no credible evidence that any minds enjoy
eternal existence.
What is knowing? Knowledge is justified true belief. Truth is logical and parsimonious
consistency with evidence and with other truth. Meaning is the context-sensitive connotation
ultimately established by relevant denotation and use. All synthetic propositions (including
this one) can only be known from experience and are subject to doubt. A synthetic statement
is propositionally meaningless if it is in principle neither falsifiable nor verifiable. A mind is
any volitional conscious faculty for perception and cognition. Minds and ideas consist
ultimately of matter. Mental states are functional states consisting of causal relations among
components for processing information. Consciousness is awareness of self and
environment. Intelligence is the ability to make, test, and apply inductions about perceptions
of self and world. There are no forms of reasoning or kinds of knowledge that are in principle
inaccessible to regular intelligence.
What is good? As autonomous living intellects, we persons value intelligence and life and the
autonomy they need to flourish. A person is any intelligent being with significant volitional
control over how it affects other beings. All persons have the right to life and liberty. All beings
have the right not to suffer torture or extinction. Liberty is volition in the absence of
aggression. Aggression consists essentially of 1) coercion or 2) damage to a person's body,
property, or rightful resources. Coercion is compulsion of one person by another through
force or threat of aggression. Justice is the minimization, reversal and punishment of
aggression. The purpose of the state is to effect justice, provide aid and sustenance to
persons in mortal danger, protect species in danger of extinction, and prevent torture.
Autocosmology is a synthesis of metaphysical naturalism, ontological materialism, epistemological
empiricism and positivism, mental functionalism, theological atheism, axiological extropianism,
political libertarianism, economic capitalism, constitutional federalism, biological evolutionism,
evolutionary psychology, and technological optimism. Autocosmology is the worldview asserted by
this text.
Human Answers
Most humans justify their answers to philosophy's questions using one of four methods.
● Faith is belief based on revelation and exempt from doubt.
● Mysticism is belief based on private and direct experience of ultimate reality.
● Skepticism is belief that is always subject to doubt and justified through objective verification.
● Cynicism is the absence of belief.
Faith is the most common mode of belief in the Western world, where the Abrahamic religions are
prevalent. Mysticism is the most common mode of belief in the Eastern world. Skepticism is practiced
worldwide (with varying amounts of rigor) by the minority of thinkers who have been influenced more
by science than by tradition. Cynicism too is practiced by a worldwide minority, often as a simplistic
reaction to the rigidity of faith, the emptiness of mysticism, or the relativism of skepticism.
A skeptic believes what he sees. A mystic believes what he feels. A
fideist believes what he hears. A cynic believes nothing. Thus
faith fails in not questioning others, and mysticism fails in not
questioning the self. Skepticism succeeds by exempting nothing from
questioning, while cynicism fails by exempting no answer from
disbelief.
Darwin made faith essentially indefensible among Western philosophers. Modern Western philosophy
is broadly divided into two traditions, each of which starts with skepticism and takes it to a certain
extreme.
Analytic philosophy is popular in English-speaking nations and focuses on logical and linguistic
clarification. The Analytic tradition has spawned two major schools:
Logical Positivism is an analytic school holding that meaningful propositions must be
either logically provable or empirically verifiable, and that propositions about metaphysics
and ethics are therefore nonsensical or at best emotional.
❍ 
Ordinary Language Analysis (or Oxford philosophy) is an analytic school holding that
the meaning of propositions lies in how their constituent terms are used in ordinary
language.
❍ 
● 
Continental philosophy is popular in France and Germany and attempts to directly confront
human existence and ethical freedom without any preconceived notions or categories. The
Continental tradition has spawned several major schools:
Phenomenology is a Continental school emphasizing intuition and raw sensory
experience.
❍ 
Existentialism is a Continental school emphasizing that the ethical freedom of raw human
existence precedes and undermines any attempt to define the essence or nature of
humanity.
❍ 
Deconstructionism (or Post-Structuralism) is a Continental school that questions even
the basic notions of objectivity and rationality.
❍ 
Critical Theory (or the Frankfurt School) is a Continental school that uses Marxist and
Hegelian theory to question the social structures underlying traditional rationality.
❍ 
● 
Analytic philosophy takes skepticism to an extreme by saying that
philosophy is only about necessary answers (logic and mathematics)
and not necessary questions (metaphysics and axiology). Continental
philosophy fails by turning methodological skepticism into mysticism
(Phenomenology, Existentialism) and cynical relativism
(Deconstructionism, Critical Theory).

Reality
Reality is everything that exists. Reality consists ultimately of matter and energy and their
fundamentally lawlike and unwilled relations in space-time.
Theories of Reality
The primary distinction in theories of reality is between Nature and Spirit.
● Nature is the aspects of the universe governed by lawlike and nonvolitional regularity.
● Spirit is anything mysteriously volitional or otherwise not governed by lawlike regularity.
Human theories of reality differ primarily according to how they analyze Spirit.
Supernaturalism is the thesis that the fundamental laws of physics make irreducible reference
to, or were created by, some agency's volition.
Theism is the thesis that the universe is affected by supernatural agency.
■ Polytheism is the thesis that the universe is affected by supernatural agencies.
Monotheism is the thesis that the universe is affected by a single supernatural
agent, God.
■ 
❍ 
❍ Pantheism is the thesis that the universe constitutes a supernatural agency.
Deism is the thesis that a supernatural agency created the universe and lets its laws operate
without interference.
❍ 
● 
Naturalism is the thesis that reality exists and operates without supernatural intervention and
according to lawlike regularities that can be understood through empirical investigation and
without special intuition.
❍ Atheism is the thesis that supernatural agency does not exist.
Agnosticism is the thesis that one does not or cannot know whether supernatural agency
exists.
❍ 
● 
Fideists usually believe in theism or deism.Theism stems from the human propensity
to take any mysterious phenomenon as an indication of supernatural
intentionality. Primitive humans invented supernatural explanations
for:
● the daily cycle of the Sun; the motions of the Moon and planets;
the seasons; rivers, currents, winds, thunder, lightning,
precipitation and drought;
● 
the genesis, design, and diversity of life; success in farming
and hunting;
● 
the human mind; evil, misfortune, disease, pestilence, war, and
death.
● 
However, the Scientific Revolution had established by the middle
1800s that physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and physiology
could be understood in naturalistic terms. Supernatural explanations
still seemed necessary for the origin and mechanism of life and mind,
and for the origin of the universe itself. In the subsequent century,
science outlined the basic answers for these questions, and theism
began to be abandoned by serious thinkers. Always hoping that the
gaps in scientific knowledge are about to miraculously stop
shrinking, most fideists have retreated into a theism based on an
increasingly irrelevant "God of the gaps".
Deists retreat directly to the last trench, and use God only to
answer the question of why there is something rather than nothing.
Deism is unparsimonious, because it cannot answer the question of why
there is God rather than not God.
Mystics usually believe in pantheism or outright idealism.Pantheism and Idealism are
incorrect because they too are unparsimonious. They infer spiritual
aspects of reality from psychological phenomena that can be explained
more parsimoniously in materialist terms.
Skeptics usually believe in naturalism. The varieties of naturalism differ primarily according to their
explanation of how matter relates to mind. While naturalists do not know why the universe exists,
there is no credible evidence or convincing argument that its existence implies supernatural agency. 
Parsimony demands that supernatural agency be held not to exist until shown otherwise.
Agnosticism constitutes either ignorance of this demand, or a
redundant restatement of the principle that synthetic propositions
are subject to doubt.
Paranormality
Many humans believe in the existence of phenomena which lie outside the materialist reality of natural
science. The phenomena alleged include:

1.1.1. Philosophy / Metaphysics / Ontology
Ontology: the study of being.
Understanding of reality and existence is built up according to experience from elements
provided by logic: terms, their properties and relations, and the attributions and inferences
that can be made among them. From these can be derived the ontological notions of
causality, existence, time, identity, and space.
Causality
A circumstance is a set of terms and their fixed properties and relations that as a whole can
be distinguished from other such sets and identified with itself. A change is a relation
between an ordered pair of distinguishable circumstances and is defined by the two
circumstances that it relates. An effect is a change that can be attributed. A cause is that to
which an effect can be attributed in whole or in part. An influence is that to which an effect
can be only partly attributed. Attribution is a fundamental concept that underlies the notions of
both ontological causality and logical properties.
A necessary cause is one which can be inferred from the effect. A sufficient cause is one from which
the corresponding effect can be inferred. To determine is to be the necessary and sufficient cause
for. Possibility is the property of not being contradicted by any inference. Logical possibility is the
property of not contradicting the laws of logic. Physical possibility is the property of not contradicting
the laws of nature.
Is causality an illusion? Does every effect have a cause, or do some effects have
no cause? Can there be a cycle of causality, in which an effect both precedes
and contributes to its cause? Can one know the answers to these questions?
Existence
The universe is the maximal set of circumstances that includes this statement and no subset
of which is causally unrelated to the remainder. To exist is to have a causal relationship with
the rest of the universe. An entity is any term that exists. Two circumstances are causally
unrelated if neither could ever influence the other.
It is unparsimonious to say other universes exist. One could imagine
a set of circumstances causally unrelated to the maximal set that
includes this sentence, and could choose to consider it a separate
universe. But to say those imagined circumstances "exist" is to
cheapen existence from causal reality to mere imaginability. An
imagining does not establish the existence of the thing imagined.
Why is there something rather than nothing? Is there an objective purpose for
that which exists? How could one recognize an answer to these questions? Are
these questions meaningless?
Humans do not know why there is something rather than nothing, or if the question is even
meaningful. If this question has a parsimonious answer, it must consist in a self-explaining fact or
cycle of facts. A candidate for such a fact would be the concept of God in the Ontological Proof, but
that proof is not convincing. Humans do not know any such fact(s), or even if they could possibly
exist. If it is asserted that non-existence is more likely or natural than existence, one could ask why this
asserted tendency (toward non-existence) itself exists.
A possibly meaningful (but unparsimonious) answer to the Ultimate Why is that the universe
exists (more precisely, is perceived to exist) roughly because it is possible. The reasoning
would be as follows. Absolute impossibility -- the state of affairs in which nothing is possible --
is itself not possible, because if nothing truly were possible, then absolute impossibility would
not be possible, implying that at least something must be possible. But if at least one thing is
possible, then it seems the universe we perceive should be no less possible than anything
else. Now, assuming that physicalism is right and that qualia and consciousness are
epiphenomena, then the phenomenology of a mind and its perfect simulation are identical. So
whether the universe we perceive existed or not, it as a merely possible universe would be
perceived by its merely possible inhabitants no differently than our actual universe is
perceived by its actual inhabitants. By analogy, the thoughts and perceptions of a particular
artificial intelligence in a simulated universe would be the same across identical "runs" of the
simulation, regardless of whether we bothered to initiate such a "run" once, twice -- or never.
Thus, the universe might merely be the undreamed possible dream of no particular dreamer.
Time
An event is a change that cannot interestingly be subdivided into constituent changes. Time
is the ordering of events according to the potential of some events to causally influence other
events. If (as in this universe) causal influence propagates through space only at finite speed,
then some events can be far enough apart in space as to be in principle unable to influence
each other. In this case time is a partial order on events instead of a total order.
An instant is a point on a linear continuum onto which events have been associated in a
particular reference frame according to their order in time. Duration is a measure of the
separation between two instants in time determined by counting intervening events of the kind
that recur in proportional numbers to each other. Examples of such events are the swings of
a pendulum or the vibrations of an atom.
Eternity is an entire linear continuum of instants. Thus by definition there is between any two
instants another instant. However, it is not necessary that between any two events there is
another event. Nor is it necessary that there be a first event, even if the past is of finite
duration. Just as there is no smallest positive real number, there might be no first event,
because there might be no event associated with a first instant (t=0). Instants are
mathematical constructs that do not always have an associated actual event.
The future is, from the perspective of a particular event, the set of all events that the event
potentially influences. The past is, from the perspective of a particular event, the set of all
events by which the event is potentially influenced. The present is, from the perspective of a
particular event, the set of all events simultaneous with it. Simultaneity is a relation enjoyed
by two events if and only if they share identical sets of past and future events.
Hypertime. Time is often said to pass or flow or to be moved through.
This metaphor of motion is misleading, because motion is spatial
displacement over time, measured for example in meters per second.
But a 'motion of time' measured in seconds per second is nonsensical,
and so temporal displacement 'over time' requires a notion of
hypertime, measured in seconds per hyper-second. This is no help,
because hypertime too will be said to flow -- through
hyper-hypertime. There is no reason to posit an absolute or universal
or extra-temporal or distinguished present that flows or passes or
marches and continuously turns absolutely future events into
absolutely past ones. Past, present, and future are relations with a
particular event and are not absolute properties in themselves.
Changing the future. The present can affect a future event, but it
cannot "change" a future event. An event is itself a change and time
is no more than an ordering of these changes. If changes themselves
can change, these hyper-changes are hyper-events that can be ordered
into hypertime. Events cannot change over time because events are
defined by their pre- and post-conditions. To talk of different
post-conditions for an event is really to talk of a different event,
just as to talk of different cardinality for a number is really to
talk of a different number. This does not imply determinism, because
determinism is a statement about inference and not about
inevitability.
Determinism is the thesis that a sufficient knowledge of any particular set of circumstances could be
used to completely infer any subsequent circumstance. Some humans take determinism to be the thesis
that the future is already decided, that the present was always going to be the way it is, that statements
about probability and possibility are merely statements about one's incomplete knowledge, and that
only actual possibility is that which is already inevitable.
Such a notion of ontological determinism is different from epistemic
determinism only if there is a hypertime in which different points of
normal time can "already" coexist. A notion of ontological
determinism that is strictly different from epistemic determinism can
have no practical consequences. As a difference that makes no
difference, ontological determinism is a thesis that parsimony
demands be rejected. Adopting the thesis makes as much sense as
adopting the thesis that the universe is five minutes old. It is
inconsequential -- and thus meaningless -- to say the future is
already decided.
Some humans argue that if determinism is true, then no argument is to
be considered valid as it is simply a train of statements following a
predestined track. First, this misconceived argument applies as well
to itself as it does to any other argument. Second, even in a
deterministic system there can arise processes that tend to produce
certain results. If viable organisms can arise, reproduce, and evolve
due to natural selection in a deterministic universe, then surely
viable arguments can arise, reproduce, and evolve due to competition
in a marketplace of ideas. The viability of an idea or argument is
closely related to its epistemological validity, and so the opposite
misconception could occur: an argument might be considered more valid
merely because it is at the end of so many predestined tracks.
Time Travel. Time travel would imply the existence of either
hypertime or circular causality. Humans have no reason to think
either exists.
Temporal Anisotropy. In a short video clip showing two billiard balls bouncing off each other,
forward and backward in time are indistinguishable if one ignores friction and inelasticity. In a longer
video of a billiards break, the future is the end in which the balls are no longer in a nicely ordered
triangle. If causes can be attributed to effects as easily as effects can be attributed to causes, then causal
laws do not distinguish past and future, and the future for an event is the direction of increasing
disorder in the system. Traces and memories of the past are a localized increase in order at the expense
of an increase in system-wide disorder. Due to statistical considerations, some systems can cycle
between order and disorder. In such systems the direction locally considered to be future can vary over
the timeline of the system.
Temporal anisotropy is not determined by the expansion of the
universe, nor by the direction of electromagnetic radiation. For
electromagnetism, the attribution of influence works equally well in
both time directions. There is no inherent difference between the
absorption and emission of a photon. Boundary conditions are
logically possible in which photons are set in motion without having
been emitted from anything, and which converge in shrinking spheres
on an anti-emitter.
Identity
Identity is the relation that obtains between two entities (or terms) that are the same instance, i.e., that
could never be counted as two. Leibniz's Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles states that if there is
no possible way to distinguish two entities then they really are the same entity.
A given entity is identified through time with its closest close-enough continuous-enough
continuer. A continuer is an entity which is similar to a previous entity and exists because of
it. A continuer is close enough if it retains enough of the original entity's properties. A
continuer is closest if it retains more of the original entity's properties than any other
continuer. A continuer is continuous enough if there is no extraordinary discontinuity in its
relationship to the original entity.
Space
Space is the seemingly boundless and continuous three-dimensional extent in which all matter is
located and all events occur. It seems logically possible that space could be not only boundless (like the
surface of a sphere) but infinite (like an infinite plane). It even seems logically possible that space
could be locally discontinuous.
Do space and time have absolute existence independent of their contents? Or are
they simply a system of relations among entities and events? Is there a way to
answer these questions, or would any answer not make a difference?
1.1.2. Philosophy / Metaphysics / Theology
Theology: the study of universal being and knowing.
God
God is supernatural agency or unity, often considered necessary, perfect, timeless, omniscient,
omnipotent, benevolent, and personal. A deity is a supernatural person, usually considered immortal,
that demands or deserves human worship or reverence and that wields supernatural influence over
human affairs.Divinity is the property of being supernatural and sacred. Sacredness is the property of
being worthy of reverence or worship.
Humans have no credible evidence or convincing proof of any deities,
including a God, Creator, First Cause, Perfect or Necessary Being.
Humans have proposed philosophical proofs of God as an alternative or supplement to historical
revelation of God's existence.
Ontological Proof. God is the most perfect idea. If God did not exist, then the idea of god
would be imperfect in its existence, and would not be the most perfect idea.
● 
Cosmological Proof. All effects must have a cause, and an infinite regress of causes is
impossible. Therefore, God is the First Cause.
● 
Teleological Proof. The universe (or its set of physical parameters) is evidently designed, and
therefore must have a Designer.
● 
Anthropological Proof. Humans have a universal sense of morality and spirituality, and the
cause of this effect is God.
● 
● Mystical Proof. God can be experienced directly.
Pascal's Wager. Blaise Pascal argued that it is a safer bet to incorrectly believe in God than to
incorrectly disbelieve in God.
● 
None of the proofs of God is generally accepted as convincing, due to various counter-arguments.
The Ontological proof assumes without evidence that ideas can
exist independently of minds, or that universals can exist
independently of instances, or in general that logical necessity
is the same thing as ontological necessity.

The Cosmological proof is unparsimonious. If God can be
self-caused, then so can the universe. Also, an infinite regress
of causes is as logically possible as an infinite progress of
effects.
● 
The Teleological proof is undermined by unrelenting progress in
reducing the number of those initial parameters and by anthropic
arguments for why they should allow the development of life and
intelligence.
● 
The Anthropological proof is undermined by other, more plausible
naturalistic explanations for the origin of human nature.
● 
The Mystical proof is undermined by other, more plausible
naturalistic explanations of mystical experiences.
● 
Pascal's Wager provides no method for choosing among conflicting
actual and possible religions, and invites one to follow false
hope and blind fear rather than clear reason. Some religions
might offer some hopes (e.g. that good behavior will be
reciprocated) that may in fact be justified (even if on grounds
other than those the religion offers). But the primary hopes
offered by all major religions -- of afterlife, or communion
with a consequential ultimate reality -- are false.
● 
Many humans claim to have evidence of revelation from their god(s). Any god could trivially inscribe
or authenticate its revealed message through supernatural patterns (in cosmological or quantum
phenomena) or ongoing miracles (such as prophecy or communication with a spirit world). There is
no credible evidence that any such revelation has been competently
attempted by any god(s).
Afterlife
Most humans believe that some form of reincarnation or immortality awaits them after death. Humans
have no credible evidence of reincarnation or any kind of afterlife.
Faith
Faith is belief based on revelation and exempt from doubt. Skepticism involves zero faith because it
holds not even a single belief that is based on revelation and exempt from doubt. Skepticism holds that
truth is not simply revealed but instead must always be subject to doubt, demonstration, and
rederivation. This belief about truth is itself neither revealed nor exempt from doubt, but is instead
subject to continual test.
It is possible (but unlikely) that this epistemological belief could one day stop yielding
satisfactory results. For example, if God appeared and started violating physical laws,
predicting the future, punishing infidels, and rewarding believers, then faith would suddenly be
more satisfactory than skepticism. Until such a development, skepticism continues to be more
satisfactory than faith.
Faith is not simply an absence of doubt, because tautologies are
beyond doubt and yet are recognized not revealed. Faith is not
simply any confident reliance on authority, because an authority can
be relied upon even confidently without being held exempt from all
doubt. Faith is not simply any provisional hypothesis believed
without complete evidence, because a proposition can be provisionally
believed without being held exempt from all doubt. Faith is not
simply any affirmation of values, because to affirm a value is not to
posit a proposition but to make a valuation. Faith is belief based on
revelation and exempt from doubt. Fideists often say skeptics too
have "faith" in science or reason, but this corrupts the definition
of 'faith'. Faith must be embarrassing if its only defense is the
claim that everybody is guilty of it.
Origin of faith. Humans' propensity for faith derives perhaps from their dependence on
teaching by parents and society. In the absence of a biological mechanism for offspring to
inherit knowledge directly, a predisposition for unquestioning belief in authority might help
spare each generation from having to rediscover or verify everything.
Mysticism
Mysticism is belief base on private and direct experience of ultimate reality. Mysticism holds that
belief can be justified simply by the intensity or directness of an experience, and without a showing
that the experience has any objective basis or consequences.
Rejecting objectivity and the distinction between the experiencer and the experienced,
mysticism thus mistakes feeling for knowing. Mystics are forever free to claim that anyone
who doesn't feel what they feel is somehow "doing it wrong". The conclusions of mysticism
are usually unfalsifiable or inconsequential and thus propositionally meaningless.
Some mystics compare meditation to advanced mathematics and claim
that both yield conclusions that can only be verified by adept
practitioners. This claim is misleading. It is true that creating and
even comprehending advanced mathematical conclusions usually requires
specialized training. But all mathematical demonstration is by
definition subject to verification through mechanical symbol
manipulation. This symbol manipulation is not necessarily private or
"interior" like the experience of a mystic, but is expressly public
and exterior.
Origin of mysticism. Humans' propensity for mysticism derives perhaps from their nature as
intelligent social animals who survive by detecting patterns and especially intentions in an
environment dominated by their social interactions. Humans appear biased to see
intentionality not only in friends, foes, predators, and prey, but also in weather, the heavens,
or the universe itself. This bias is perhaps related to the general human tendency (known in
psychology as the Fundamental Attribution Error) to incorrectly emphasize intentional
explanations over situational or circumstantial ones.
Religion
Religion is any system of belief based on faith or mysticism, or involving worship of or reverence for
some deity.
Science and Religion. A common misconception is that science might
be an alternative to religion for answering questions about meaning
and value. Those questions are the domain of philosophy, whereas
science deals with objective phenomena. Science depends on the
epistemological principle of skepticism, and any "conflict" between
science and religion is really a conflict between skepticism and
faith (or mysticism). Religion can be made superficially compatible
with science by restricting itself to questions that are a)
scientific but unanswered or b) philosophical. However, faith- or
mysticism-based religion can never be compatible with the skepticism
on which science -- and all epistemologically valid philosophy -- is
built.
Belief Systems
Most humans attempt to understand the world through faith or mysticism. Of the major groups of
believers, only agnostics and atheists avoid both faith and mysticism. This table summarizes the major
human belief systems. Statistics on adherents are assembled from various sources, including
Encyclopedia Britannica and adherents.com. The 'Deity' column identifies each system's type of
supernaturalism , except that for monotheisms it instead names the deity. The 'Fate' column tells what
each system believes happens to a person after death.
● death: personality ceases at death.
● judged: the quality of an eternal afterlife is determined by a judgment of one's mortal behavior.
rebirth: personality is after death recycled into a new organism, usually according to one's mortal
behavior and with a loss of memory, and sometimes with the possibility that with good enough
behavior or insight the cycle can be broken into communion.
● 
commun: personality ascends after death to a higher plane of (perhaps non-personal) communion
with the universe.
● 
● immort: personality graduates after death to (usually disembodied but conscious) immortality.

Fideisms
Judaism is the Semitic monotheistic fideist religion based on the Old Testament's (1000-600 BCE)
rules for the worship of Yahweh by his chosen people, the children of Abraham's son Isaac (c1800
BCE).
Zoroastrianism is the Persian monotheistic fideist religion founded by Zarathustra (c628-c551 BCE)
and which teaches that good must be chosen over evil in order to achieve salvation.
Christianity is the West Eurasian monotheistic fideist religion professing that Jesus of Nazareth (c6
BCE - c30 AD) is the descendent of Abraham and the Son of God whose sacrifice for humanity's sins
was recorded in the New Testament (c100), and who fulfilled the prophecies of the divinely inspired
Old Testament.
Islam is the Middle Eastern monotheistic fideist religion professing surrender to the will of Allah
(God), whose revelations in the Old and New Testaments were superseded by the Koran revealed to
Muhammad (c570 - 632-06) for his chosen people, the children of Abraham's son Ishmael (c1800
BCE).
Sikhism is the Punjab monotheistic fideist religion founded by Guru Nanak (1469-1539) and whose
sacred Adi Granth (1604) overlays a spartan righteousness onto Hindu cyclical cosmology.
These religions place unwarranted faith in purported revelations for
which there is no credible evidence of authenticity or validity.
Mysticisms
Hinduism is the South Asian polytheistic mystical religion based on the Veda scriptures (c1000 BCE)
and professing a cyclical cosmology, an ultimate reality called brahman, gods Vishnu and Shiva, and
reincarnation of atman (soul) under the influence of karma.
Taoism is the Chinese polytheistic mystical religion based on the Tao-Te-Ching ascribed to Lao Tzu
(c550 BCE) and which advocates a path (tao) of minimalist serenity and reverence for various deities.
Shintoism is the Japanese polytheistic mystical religion involving mainly the observance of customs
and festivals honoring various deities.
Jainism is the Indian pantheist mystical religion founded by Mahavira (599-527 BCE) and which
blends monastic asceticism with Buddhist cyclical cosmology.
Buddhism is the East Asian pantheist mystical religion founded in India c525 BCE by the Buddha, who
taught that existence is cyclical suffering caused by desiring and can be overcome by the "eightfold
path" of right thought and deed.
Confucianism is the Chinese nontheistic mystical religion based on the sayings of Confucius (c500
BCE) recorded in the Analects, and which teaches social order, scholarship, filial reverence for family
and ancestors, and divination.
These religions posit entities (such as gods or spirits or forces) to
explain subjective mystical experiences which have simpler
naturalistic explanations. These religions allege phenomena (such as
rebirth and divination) for which there is no credible evidence.
Evidence For Christianity
Since Christianity is the most prevalent belief system among humans,
it deserves special attention. The best evidence for the Christian
doctrine of a divine Jesus is:
Epistles c.50-60CE
Paul's letters broadly confirm the teachings and miracles of
Jesus, and specifically his resurrection [1 Cor 15].
❍ 
● 
Gospels c.60-90CE
The veracity of the gospel accounts is supported by their
mutual aggreement and their inclusion of embarrassing and
vivid details.
❍ 
The gospels are unanimously persuasive that Jesus died, and
report many vivid accounts of encounters with the risen
Jesus.
❍ 
The gospels describe in vivid detail Jesus' miracles (many
healings, three reanimations, etc.) and their acceptance
throughout Judea and Galilee.
❍ 
● 
Extra-biblical evidence
The 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus confirms the
historicity of Jesus by mentioning him as the brother of the
martyred James.
❍ 
Non-Christian writers like Josephus and Celsus agree that
Jesus was known for his "feats" and "wonders".
❍ 
Christianity as a movement survived even in Palestine among
the people who would have had the best available opportunity
for refuting its claims.
❍ 
● 
Arguments Against Christianity
The main reasons not to believe the Christian doctrine of a divine
Jesus are:
the alternative naturalistic explanations of the existing
evidence;
● 
● the missing evidence needed to prove such divinity;
● the implausibility of such divine activity; and
● the cascading implications of accepting such evidence.
In addition, the Christian gospels themselves are suspect because of
their sources, contradictions, and apologetics.
Naturalistic explanations. Jesus of Nazareth was a faith healer and
self-proclaimed divine savior who tried to reform his native Jewish
religion. However, the evidence about Jesus is less likely to have
resulted from divinity than from misinterpretation, exaggeration,
rationalization, delusion, deception, and mythologizing. Indeed,
perhaps the greatest weakness of the claims for Jesus' divinity is
the gospels' reliance on and vouching for the Old Testament, a
patchwork of folklore, legends and myths about a tribe whose
patriarch Abraham turned to monotheism because of fertility problems.
Jesus was a Jewish prophet who affirmed Jewish law [Mt 5:17-18; Lk
2:27,39; Jn 10:35], observed the Jewish calendar [Lk 4:16, Mt 24:20],
and preached in Jewish synagogues [Mk 1:21, 1:39, 6:2; Mt 4:23, 9:35,
13:54; Lk 4:15, 4:44, 6:6, 13:10, 19:47; Jn 6:59, 18:20] exclusively
to Jews [Mt 10:5, Mt 15:24] about the God of Israel [e.g. Mk 12:29]
Miracles. In the gospels Jesus heals the sick (blindness, skin
disorder, bleeding, fever, paralysis, withered hand), revives the
recently deceased, calms a storm, multiplies food, and walks on
water. The miracles ascribed to Jesus seem not to have been very
convincing [Mt 11:20, Lk 10:13, Jn 6:66, 10:32, 12:37, 15:24], and
seem explainable by a combination of conventional faith healing,
exaggeration, and mythologizing. The three people Jesus allegedly
reanimates [Mk 5/Lk 8; Lk 7; Jn 11] might not actually have been
clinically dead, and the gospels report not a single indication
supporting such a diagnosis. Any cases of blindness, paralysis, or
demonic possession cured by Jesus could have been psychogenic. The
one case of congenital blindness is recorded as disputed, and only in
the latest gospel [Jn 9].
God? The Christian doctrine of the "trinity", attempting to reconcile
Jewish monotheism with Jesus' self-revelation, holds that Jesus 1) is
both fully human and fully divine, and 2) is God (in a different
"person"). The former is a contradiction, and the latter has no
scriptural basis. In the gospels Jesus never claims identity with God
or even explicit divinity, but rather a divinely special status as
"the Son of God" and the "Anointed One" (Hebrew: messiah; Greek:
christos). Jesus repeatedly distinguishes himself from God:
Why do you call me good? No one is good--except God alone. [Mk
10:18, Lk 18:17]
● 
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in
heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. [Mk 13:32]
● 
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be
forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will
not be forgiven. [Lk 12:10]
● 
Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my
will, but yours be done. [Lk 22:42-43]
● 
● Father, into your hands I commit my spirit. [Lk 23:46]
the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the
Son [Jn 5:22]
● 
By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my
judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who
sent me. [Jn 5:30]
● 
I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught
me. [Jn 8:28]
● 
● I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but
he sent me. [Jn 8:42]
If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who is
glorifying me, of whom ye say that He is your God. [Jn 8:54]
● 
I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me
commanded me what to say and how to say it. [Jn 12:49]
● 
The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the
Father, living in me, who is doing his work [Jn 14:10]
● 
If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the
Father, for the Father is greater than I. [Jn 14:28]
● 
'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
God. [Jn 20:17]
● 
● As the Father has sent me, I am sending you. [Jn 20:21]
When Jesus' opponents say his assumption of authority could be
interpreted as a claim of divinity, all three synoptics agree [Mk
2:10, Mt 9:6, Lk 5:24] that Jesus merely asserted "authority on
earth", and none intimates that his accusers concluded he was
affirming their accusation. In the one instance in the gospels [Jn
10:33ff] in which Jesus' identity with God is explicitly discussed,
Jesus cites a Psalm [82:6] as a precedent for his metaphor, and
hastily retreats to his formulation of being "God's Son", adding
vaguely that "the Father is in me, and I in the Father" (which 1 Jn
2:15 says is true of anyone who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of
God). When at another time [Jn 5:18ff] the Jews characterized the
"Son of Man" title as "making himself equal with God", Jesus
answered not by claiming identity but by drawing distinctions:
● the Son can do nothing by himself
● the Father loves the Son
the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the
Son
● 
● the Father sent the Son
● the Father has granted the Son to have life in him
● the Father has given him authority to judge
● I seek not to please myself but him who sent me
Thus Jesus retreats the only two times he is accused of claiming
identity or equality with God. In the Passion story, Jesus was mocked
or accused as a faith healer, prophet, king of the Jews, Messiah, and
"Son of God" [Jn 19:7] -- but never as divine or as a god. When Jesus
died, onlookers are said to have exclaimed not that Jesus was God,
but rather the "Son of God" [Mat 27:54].
The title of 'God' is never reliably applied to Jesus anywhere in the
New Testament. (In many translations of 2 Pet 1:1 and Titus 2:13, the
description "God and Saviour" is seemingly applied to Jesus, but the
scholarly consensus regards these two letters as late and
pseudoepigraphic.) Acts quotes [2:22, 2:36, 3:13, 10:38, 17:31] Peter
and Paul describing Jesus in terms of a man appointed to an office,
but never calling him God. The gospel authors never explicitly claim
Jesus to be God, and the closest they come is the vague language of
Jn 1: "the Word was God" and "became flesh". John quotes Thomas
exclaiming [Jn 20] "my Lord and my God", but immediately states
[20:31] as a creed merely "that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God".
The "mystery" of Jesus' nature was hardly clarified by the Apostles
[e.g. Phil 2:6, Rom 1:4, Col 1:15, Col 2:9], whose epistles never
claim Jesus has any kind of identity with God. (Christian scribes
tried to change that; cf. the differing manuscripts for Rom 9:5, Acts
20:28, and 1 Tim 3:16.)
Thus, just as Jesus failed to leave clear teachings about salvation,
hell, divorce, circumcision, and diet, he also did not effect a
competent revelation of who precisely he was. Depending on e.g.
various 4th-century Roman emperors, there waxed and waned such
christological heresies as Ebionism, Docetism, Adoptionism, Dynamic
Monarchianism, Sabellianism, Arianism, Marcionism, Apollonarianism,
Nestorianism, Monophysitism, and Monothelitism. The doublethink of
the "trinity" is not found in the Bible, but instead was invented to
reconcile Jewish monotheism with Jesus' idiosyncratic Sonship claims.
"Son of God". Jesus seems to have been illegitmate, and to have been
known to be such in his community [Mt 1:18-24, Jn 8:41]. His only
recorded words before his ministry concern his disobedience [Lk
2:48,51] at age 12 to his mother and stepfather, whom he denied [cf.
Mt 23:9] by calling the Temple "my Father's house". He spurned his
stepfather's trade of carpentry to take up a ministry proclaiming
himself the son not of Joseph but of God. Despite alleged angelic
revelations [Lk 1:32, Mt 1:20, Mt 2:13, Mt 2:20] to Mary and Joseph,
they (and Jesus' siblings) did not believe in him [Jn 7:5, Mt 13:57]
and thought him "out of his mind" [Mk 3:21], leading Jesus to
repeatedly stress [Mk 3:33, 10:29; Mt 10:37, 12:48, 19:29; Lk
11:27-28, 14:26] that one should choose God over one's biological
family. Only on the day of his death do the gospels record a single
friendly word [Jn 19:26] from Jesus to his family.
Delusional Schizophrenic? Jesus began his (apparently one-year)
ministry as a follower of John the Baptist (whose embarrassing
baptism of Jesus is played down or not mentioned in the later
gospels). In the earliest gospel (Mark), Jesus never calls himself
Christ/Messiah, is reluctant for his special nature to be known, and
(as he does in Matthew) despairs on the cross. (By contrast, in the
later Luke and John, Jesus asserts he is Christ, and confidently
assures a co-crucified convict of their impending ascension.) Jesus
"could not do many miracles" in his hometown [Mk 6:5, Mt 13:58, Lk
4:24], and he at times was considered mad by other Jews [Jn 10:20].
Jesus' ministry seems not to have been joined by a single family
member or prior acquaintance, but only by strangers. Jesus satisifed
the diagnostic criteria of paranoid schizophrenia:
hallucinations: hearing or seeing God, Satan, demons, and
angels;
● 
deslusions of grandiosity: belief that he is the salvific
Christ/Messiah with miraculous powers and apocalyptic
foreknowledge;
● 
delusions of persecution: temptation by Satan; opposition by
demons;
● 
an insidious reduction in external relations and interests:
nomadic asceticism; estrangement from his family.
● 
However, Jesus was not so mentally ill as to believe he was
omnipotent. The gospels say repeatedly [Jn 7:1, 8:59, 11:53-54,
12:36; Mt 12:14-15, Mk 3:6-7, Lk 13:31,33] that Jesus retreated from
or avoided danger. He was secretive and evasive about his special
nature [Mk 3:12, 8:30, 4:41; Lk 9:21, 10:22-24; Mt 16:20; Jn 2:24,
8:25-29, 10:24-38, 12:34], and reluctant to have his powers tested
[Mk 8:12; Lk 11:29, 23:8; Mt 4:7, 12:39, 16:4; Jn 2:18]. He was
likely neither liar nor lunatic, but rather a preacher, faith-healer,
and apocalyptic prophet who in the months leading up to his
anticipated execution came to believe he was the Jewish Messiah and
even the divinely-special savior of mankind.
Resurrection. At his death the apostles abandoned Jesus in panic,
even though they should have been expecting his resurrection if they
had indeed witnessed his miracles, heard his divinity claims, and
heard him say at least four times [Mk 8:31, 10:34; Mat 16:21, 17:23,
20:19; Lk 9:22, 18:33, 24:7, 24:46] that he would "rise from the
dead" or be "raised to life" "on the third day". The New Testament
accounts of the resurrection appearances develop over time from
silent to vague to contradictory to fantastic. The Empty Tomb story
could have resulted from a discreet reburial or removal -- perhaps by
a disciple, as in a rumor reported in Mt 28. Possible conspirators
were Joseph of Arimathea and Mary Magdalene, a longtime disciple [Lk
8:2] "out of whom [Jesus] had driven seven demons" [Mk 16:9, Lk 8:2]
and who (unlike any apostle) attended both the crucifixion and
entombment. She was the first to visit the tomb on Easter [Mt 28:1,
Jn 20:1], and the possibility of removal [Jn 20:2,14,15] was not
unimaginable to her. She weepingly lingered [Jn 20:11] after the
apostles left the empty tomb, and thereupon was the first [Mk 16:9,
Mt 28:9, Jn 20:14] to claim seeing an appearance. The appearances
were suspiciously exclusive: "God raised him on the third day and
caused him to be seen. He was not seen by all the people, but by
witnesses whom God had already chosen" [Acts 10:40-41]. Many of the
"appearances" seem to have been unimpressive to the disciples who
heard about them and even to those who witnessed them:
But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed
to them like idle tales. [Lk 24:11]
● 
● When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him,
they did not believe it. Afterward Jesus appeared in a different
form to two of them [Mk 16:11-12]
These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not
believe them either. [Mk 16:13]
● 
When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. [Mt
28:17]
● 
Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were
kept from recognizing him. [Lk 24:15-16]
● 
she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not
realize that it was Jesus. Thinking he was the gardener, she
said ... [Jn 20:14-15]
● 
Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that
it was Jesus. [Jn 21:4]
● 
Early Christians probably combined the idea of spiritual resurrection
or an empty tomb with these cases of "idle tales" and hallucinatory
mistaken identity, and embellished the result with stories ("written
that you may believe" [Jn 20:31]) like the wound examination by
Thomas [Jn 20:19-29].
Missing evidence. A divine Jesus could trivially create new miracles
to unambiguously vouch for some modern school of Christianity. For
the gospel accounts of Jesus to be believable, two kinds of evidence
would have to surface:
Textual discoveries that Jesus did not believe in the literal
truth of the entire Old Testament, and that the unjust Christian
notion of eternal damnation is a misunderstanding.
● 
Compelling corroboration of gospel miracles through physical
artifacts (e.g. the Shroud of Turin) or historical records (e.g.
of the three-hour darkness on Good Friday).
● 
However, available extra-scriptural records do not corroborate the
gospel miracles. Christian apologists often claim that if false, the
gospel traditions would have been refuted and discredited by
skeptics in 1st-century Palestine. However, there is no indication
that the Jesus movement was important enough then to merit the sort
of early written debunking that would have been preserved despite
skeptical apathy and Christian hostility. Except for the stolen-body
rumor denied in Mat 28, the earliest records of anti-Christian
skepticism date after the first century and are preserved mainly as
excerpts in Christian rebuttals. Celsus (quoted by Origen) dismissed
the miracles as the "tricks of jugglers" that he said are "feats
performed by those who have been taught by Egyptians", and the Jewish
slander reported by Tertullian claimed the empty tomb was faked.
The 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus is hard to count as
anti-Christian, even after discounting his affirmation (unnoticed by
all of his earliest Christian commentators) of the resurrection as an
interpolation. Josephus may have written that Jesus "performed
surprising works" and even that he was believed to have been
resurrected, but the (possibly interpolated) mention is only in
passing. Josephus devotes more space each to John the Baptist and
James, and while reporting much minutiae over the entire period
during which Jesus lived, does not mention:
● the Christmas Star that disturbed Herod and "all
Jerusalem" [Mt 2:3],
● Herod's massacre [Mt 2:16],
● the Good Friday earthquake [Mt 27:51],
● the Good Friday resurrectees that "appeared to many
people" in Jerusalem [Mt 27:53], or
● the Good Friday 3-hour darkness "over all the land" [Mk
15:33, Lk 23:44, Mt 27:45].
These events in fact went unnoticed by every non-Christian writer,
including the historians Seneca and Pliny the Elder. (Syncellus
quotes a lost text of the Christian historian Julius Africanus which
itself cites a lost text by Thallus: "Thallus calls this darkness an
eclipse". The identification of Thallus' eclipse with "this darkness"
might just be in the mind of Julius Africanus, and Thallus at any
rate cannot be reliably dated as writing independently of the
gospels.) The Alexandrian philosopher and commentator Philo outlived
Jesus by 15 or 20 years, and as a visitor to Jerusalem should have
met witnesses to the Easter miracles. His silence suggests that Jesus
and his followers did not make the early impression that they should
have if the gospels were true.
Implausibility. The gospel story of a Hebrew faith healer in the
backward Roman province of Palestine seems an unlikely
self-revelation for the omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent
Creator of the universe:
● Why such ambiguous and picayune miracles? Why not raise a
new mountain in the desert, or install a new star in the
heavens?
● Why such vague and equivocal claims of divinity?
● Why after his resurrection appear so ambiguously, so
briefly, and to only his disciples? Why not -- after
perhaps a more convincing execution, e.g. beheading -- march
back to Pilate and Herod and ascend in front of Jerusalem
assembled?
● Why not write his revelation himself, and ensure that it
survive in perfect copies? Why not include in it
indisputible authentication, e.g. by predicting a
fundamental physical constant?
The God of the Bible is far too pedestrian in his works, parochial in
his concerns, petty in his decisions, and primitive in his policies.
Works. In the gospels Jesus heals the sick, revives the recently
deceased, calms a storm, walks on water, and multiplies food. The god
of the Torah makes appearances, speeches, promises, and predictions;
raises the dead; and takes credit for various plagues, fires, floods,
astronomical events, victories, healings, and deaths. It is
implausible that the Creator's works would be so confined to ancient
times and so apparently constrained by ancient imaginations.
Concerns. After creating billions of galaxies in Genesis, the god of
the Torah is implausibly obsessed with the family of Abraham and the
Jordan valley where they live. It seems implausible that an
omnibenevolent, omniscient, infallible deity would entrust a few
fallible men in a backward corner of the world with such paltry
evidence and then demand that everyone else either hear and believe
them or suffer eternal damnation.
Decisions. In the gospels Jesus damns entire towns [Mt 11:23],
compares non-Israelites to dogs [Mt 15:26], and affirms even "the
smallest letter" [Mt 5:18, Jn 10:35] of the Torah. The god of the
Torah tests and torments his followers, commits mass murders of e.g.
Noah's flood victims and the firstborn sons of Egypt [Ex 12:29],
creates linguistic division for fear of an ancient construction
project [Gen 11:6], and curses mankind because Adam dared to "become
like one of us, knowing good and evil" [Gen 3:22]. It is implausible
that the Creator of the universe would be so petty and wicked.
Policies. The god of the Torah promotes or demands extravagant
worship, dietary taboos, animal sacrifice, repressive sexual codes,
human mutilation, monarchy, subjugation of women, slavery, human
sacrifice [Lev 27:29, Jud 11:30-39], and mass murder of even infants
[Ex 11:5, 1 Sam 15:3]. In the gospels Jesus affirms the Torah and
promises sinners not a thousand years' torture, nor a million or a
billion, but an eternity of excruciating torture by fire [Mt 18:8].
It is implausible that the Creator of the universe would promote such
primitive and evil policies.
Cascading implications. If the existing evidence about Jesus of
Nazareth is considered a convincing proof of his divinity, then many
other things can be proven with similar evidence.
Miracles were reported commonly in ancient times and are
attested in many other religions. Christians might argue that
competing miracles were wrought by demons, but those very
miracles could be used by a competing religion to justify the
same claim about Jesus' miracles.
● 
Martyrs have been common throughout human history. If dying for
a belief can show the belief is true, then the kamikazes of
Japan showed that Emperor Hirohito was divine. Note that Peter
and James are the only resurrection witnesses who the New
Testament names (John 21:18,19, Acts 12:2) as martyrs, but there
is no evidence that recanting their presumed belief in physical
resurrection could have saved them. All other Christian martyrs
● 
died, like the kamikazes, for what they were told and not for
what they witnessed.
Prophecies. No non-trivial prophecy in the Bible has both a)
been documented as having been made before the predicted event
and b) had its fulfillment documented independently of the Bible
itself. If self-fulfilling prophecy is considered valid, then
for example the Book of Mormon is a valid prophetic text.
● 
Gospel sources. The gospels were stitched together decades after the
crucifixion by non-eyewitness zealots freely borrowing from oral
traditions and now-lost earlier texts.
Other gospels. At least a dozen other gospels (e.g. of Thomas
and Peter) are known from whole texts, fragments, and ancient
references, but were not deemed by the early Christians to be
divinely inspired.
● 
Differing manuscripts show that the gospels have undergone
insertions, deletions, additions, and revisions.
● 
Copying. Matthew and Luke are based in part on copying from Mark
and in part apparently on a now-lost earlier compilation of
Jesus sayings.
● 
Anonymity, Contemporaneity. The gospels were written 35-60 years
after Jesus' death, and (unlike every other intact work of
classical nonfiction) no authors are identified in the earliest
copies. Only about a century later did the gospels become
associated with the names of their alleged authors. Writing
extensively twenty years after Jesus' death, Paul gives no hint
that any gospel had yet been written down.
● 
Mark was written c.65-70 by an unknown author who later church
tradition said was an associate of the apostle Peter. The
earliest copies of this gospel end abruptly at 16:8 before any
visions of the risen Jesus, which were added later in various
differing endings.
● 
Matthew was written c.70-80 by an unknown author who later
church tradition identified with the apostle Matthew, but the
text heavily quotes the non-eyewitness Mark rather than
providing an independent eyewitness account. Matthew changes
(21:5 vs. Mk 11:7) or embellishes (2:15, 2:23) its narrative to
make it fulfill Old Testament prophecies.
● 
Luke was written c.80 by a supposed companion of Paul. Luke is
confused (4:23, 31, 44; 24:12) about Palestinian geography.
Writing after the fall of Jerusalem, Luke in 21:8 modifies Mark
13:6 to say the end is not necessarily near.
● 
John was written c.90 by an unknown author who is ambiguously
identified (in the third person: 21:24) with the apostle John
only in the final chapter, which is itself an apparent addendum.
● 
Gospel contradictions. Among the many minor contradictions and
inconsistencies in the gospels are several that cast significant
doubt on the gospels' central message of a divine messiah foretold by
the prophets.
Genealogy. Wildly contradictory genealogies for Jesus are given
in Mt 1 and Lk 3, which cannot even agree on the father of
Joseph.
● 
Birthplace. Lk 2:4 and 2:39 say Joseph and Mary lived in
Nazareth before Jesus' birth, but Mt 2:23 says Joseph only later
moved his family to "a town called Nazareth".
● 
Birthdate. Luke says Jesus was born during [2:2] the census of
Quirinius and before [1:5] the death of Herod. The census was in
6 CE, but Herod died in 4 BCE.
● 
Chronology. John indicates Jesus' ministry lasted two or three
years, while the earlier Synoptic gospels indicate one. John
says Jesus cast out the money changers at the beginning of his
ministry, while the Synoptics say it was right before his
crucifixion.
● 
Second coming. Jesus said [Mt 16:28, Lk 9:27] some "standing
here" would live to see "the kingdom of God". Jesus also said
[Mk 13:30, Lk 21:32, Mt 24:34] that "this generation" would not
pass away before the "see[ing] the Son of Man coming in clouds
with great power and glory" as well as a "distress" "never to be
equalled". Jesus' audience of course saw no such "kingdom" or
"coming", and no "distress" like e.g. the Black Death or
Holocaust.
● 
Appearances. The poor geographer Luke places resurrection
appearances only around Jerusalem [Lk 24:33,49], while the other
three gospels [Mk 16:7, Mt 28:10-16, Jn 21:1] report Galilee
appearances.
● 
Gospel apologetics. Certain assertions and omissions in the gospels
seem to either suspiciously deny or unwittingly create embarrassing
alternative explanations for the claims therein.
Self-fulfilling prophecy. The gospels repeatedly relate [Lk 2:4,
Mt 2:15, 21:4, 27:9, Jn 19:23, 36] hard-to-verify (and
easy-to-fabricate) details and then cite them as fulfillment of
prophecy. Each of these details is in only one gospel.
● 
Vouching. The author(s) of John protest (19:35 and 21:24) that
the testimony quoted in this gospel is true, and admit (20:31)
it has "been written so that you may believe". The 2nd letter of
Peter claims [1:16] the gospels are not "cleverly invented
stories", then warns [2:3] that "false prophets" will employ
"stories they have made up".
● 
John dies. John 21:23 (in the appended final chapter) makes an
excuse for Jesus' apparent promise that John would not die
before the second coming.
● 
Empty tomb. Alone among the gospels, Matthew [27:64] alleges an
order by Pilate that Jesus' tomb be guarded to prevent his
● 
disciples from secretly removing his body. Matthew 28 reports a
widespread story of such a secret removal and attempts to
discredit it by saying Pilate's guards were bribed. In the other
gospels the first disciples to check the tomb encounter no
guards.
Appearances. In order of writing, the gospel accounts of Jesus'
resurrected appearances become increasingly elaborate. None of
the alleged (and almost certainly pseudepigraphic) letters of
Peter, James, Jude, and John mention an empty tomb or a physical
resurrection, even in contexts [1 Pet 3:18, 1 Pet 5:1, 2 Pet
1:16] where one might expect them to. The first written account
of appearances (1 Cor 15) vaguely lumps them together with
post-ascension manifestations to Paul in a discussion of
spiritual resurrection, making them suspect as accounts of
bodily resurrection. Original Mark claims an empty tomb but
describes no appearances. Matthew says simply that the two Marys
and later the Eleven "saw him" but "some were dubious". The
Longer Ending of Mark says Jesus appeared "in a different form"
[Mk 16:12] to two disciples, and simply "appeared" to the
Eleven. Luke elaborates on both of these episodes, building the
latter into an account that approaches the full Doubting Thomas
story finally told in John. Thus, reports of the resurrection
become more assertive as the accounts grow more removed from the
actual events.
● 
Eyewitnesses. There is no reliably first-hand testimony to the
physical resurrection of Jesus. Paul does not claim to be such a
witness. Original Mark contains no appearances at all. Matthew
is anonymous and contains no assertions of first-hand witness by
the author. The anonymous author of Luke admits he was not an
eyewitness. In what appears to be an addendum, the anonymous
author of John vaguely refers to "the beloved disciple" in the
third person as "the disciple who testifies to these things and
who wrote them down" [21:24], and otherwise makes no assertions
of his own eyewitness.
● 
1.2. Philosophy / Epistemology
Epistemology: the study of knowledge.
1. Philosophy Of Mind: the study of the faculty for thinking and knowing.
2. Philosophy Of Science: the study of scientific knowledge.
Knowledge
Knowledge is justified true belief. Belief in a proposition p is justified if 1) it is developed
though a process that reliably yields truth, 2) it is appropriately caused by the fact that p is
true, and 3) it would generally not be held if p were false. The reliability criterion entails that
synthetic (i.e. inductive) knowledge is always provisional. The causal and counterfactual
criteria entail that whether a true belief counts as knowledge depends on inherently imprecise
judgments concerning whether the believer is accidentally right. Operationally, a belief is
justified if and only if it is convincing and defensible.
Truth
Truth is logical and parsimonious consistency with evidence and with other truth. Evidence is
any and all perceived circumstances.
The Principle of Parsimony (or Occam's Razor) is that the simpler of two explanations is to be
preferred when they are otherwise equivalent.
Humans have proposed several criteria for truth.
The Correspondence Theory of Truth is that the terms of true propositions map to elements of
reality in a way that validates the proposition.
● 
The Coherence Theory of Truth is that true propositions are those in the system of mutually
coherent propositions that is more complete than any rival system.
● 
The Pragmatic Theory of Truth is that true propositions are those that are most useful to
believe and that are thus "fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate".
● 
The Correspondence Theory begs the question by assuming that reality
can be known directly and certainly. Depending on the meaning of
'complete', the Coherence Theory either reduces to the Correspondence
Theory, or it makes truth a purely social (or divine) construct. The
Pragmatic Theory either underdetermines the truth of certain
propositions, or it reduces to a variant of the social version of the
Coherence Theory. The proper notion of truth is coherence grounded
in correspondence.
Origins of Knowledge
Propositions can classified according to the dependence of their truth value on their terms:
Analytic propositions are those whose truth value can be deduced from only the definitions of
their terms.
● 
Synthetic propositions are those whose truth value cannot be deduced from only the definitions
of their terms.
● 
Epistemic Provisionality. All synthetic propositions (including this one) can only be known
from experience and are subject to doubt. It is logically possible that all experience is
deceptive and that the world is illusory. The only absolutely certain truths are true analytic
propositions and the synthetic proposition that something exists.
Cogito Ergo Sum. Descartes argued "I think, therefore I am". However,
"I" could be illusory, and the fact of my thinking only warrants the
certainty that something exists: cogito ergo est.
Meaning
The denotation (or extension) of a term is the set of entities it refers to. Theconnotation
(or intension) of a term is the properties and concept(s) associated with it.
The meaningof a term is the context-sensitive connotation ultimately established by its
relevant denotation and use.
The Verifiability Principle holds that a statement is propositionally meaningless (i.e. states no
proposition) if it is neither logically decidable nor empirically verifiable. Positivism is a stricter form
of Empiricism that asserts the Verifiability Principle.
Theories of Meaning
Humans have proposed three sorts of explanation for meaning:
The Referential Theory of Meaning is that the meaning of a term is the things in the world it
refers to.
● 
The Conceptual Theory of Meaning is that the meaning of a term is the properties and
concepts associated with it.
● 
The Behavioral Theory of Meaning is that the meaning of a term consists of the behaviors and
dispositions associated with it.
● 
The Referential Theory is confounded by terms that have the same
referent but different meaning, such as 'morning star' and 'evening
star'. The Conceptual Theory reduces to dictionary-like circularity
for many concepts that can only be described by the word(s) to which
they help give meaning. The Behavioral Theory is undermined by
behaviors and dispositions that underspecify the meanings they are
supposed to impart.
Theories of Knowledge
Humans fall into two camps depending on whether they believe synthetic a priori knowledge is
possible:
Rationalism is the thesis that some synthetic propositions can be known from reason alone and
independent of any experience.
● 
● Empiricism is the thesis that all synthetic propositions can only be known from experience.
Rationalism incorrectly assumes that existence arranges for reason to
discover the nature of reality through introspection alone.
1.2.1. Philosophy / Epistemology / Philosophy Of Mind
Philosophy Of Mind: the study of the faculty for thinking and knowing.
1. Essence of Mind.
2. Accidence of Mind.
3. Relations of Mind.
Minds and ideas, like all of reality, consist ultimately of matter. Mental states are functional
states consisting of causal relations among components for processing information.
Theories of Mind
 Philosophers often divide all phenomena into three kinds:
● mind (or spirit or soul): that which can think and perceive;
● ideas (or universals or forms): that which can be thought; and
● matter (or substance): that which can be perceived.
Human theories of mind differ according to how they explain these phenomena in general and the
Mind-Body Problem in particular. The Mind-Body Problem is the problem of explaining how
mindless unconscious matter can give rise to or interact with mind and consciousness. Human theories
of mind include:
● Idealism is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of mind and ideas rather than matter.
Dualism is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of both the material or physical and the ideal
or mental.
Substance Dualism is the thesis that the material and the ideal or mental constitute two
different and fundamental kinds of objects.
❍ 
Property Dualism is the thesis that the material or physical and the ideal or mental
constitute two different and fundamental kinds of properties. Property dualism can be a
form of materialism if it says that mental properties are nevertheless fundamental material
properties (analogous to mass or charge).
❍ 
● 
Materialism is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of matter.
Logical Behaviorism is the thesis that mental states can be fully and best explained in
terms of behaviors and behavioral dispositions.
❍ 
❍ Identity Theory is the thesis that mental states and brain states are identical.
Functionalism is the thesis that mental states are functional states consisting of causal
relations among components for processing information.
❍ 
● 
Idealism is incorrect because its explanation of matter is either
inadequate or unparsimonious. Dualism is incorrect because it
unparsimoniously posits a realm of the ideal. Logical Behaviorism is
unsatisfactory because behavioral explanations are too unwieldy. 
Identity Theory is incorrect because it holds that the essence of
mind is its construction instead of its function.
1.2.1.1. Philosophy / Epistemology / Philosophy Of Mind / Essence of Mind
A mind is any volitional conscious faculty for perception and cognition.
Cognition
Cognition is the process of learning, reasoning, and knowing. Learning is the processing of
experience into an increase in knowledge or behavioral effectiveness. Reasoning is the process of
making and evaluating valid inferences.
Perception
Perception is the process of organizing sensation into experience. Sensation is the process of external
influence on a monitoring or control system. Experience is any relatively unified and coherent
interpretation of related contemporaneous sensations.
Consciousness
Consciousness is awareness of self and environment. Awareness is the direct and central
availability of information in a monitoring or control system.
Volition
Volition is the power or act of making decisions about an agent's own actions. A decision is the
causing by a system of events which were not physically determined from outside the system but rather
were at least somewhat contingent on the internals of the system, and which were not predictable
except perhaps by modeling the internals of the system.
Free will is either of the doctrines that human choices are a) determined internally rather than
externally (volitional free will) or b) not pre-determined at all (indeterminate free will). Determinism
is incompatible with indeterminate free will, but is compatible with volitional free will if agents have
internal state that influences (and thus helps determines) their actions. Volitional free will is also
compatible with forms of indeterminism in which the acausality is not so rampant as to undermine
agent self-influence. Indeterminate free will requires indeterminism, but degenerates into uncaused
chance if acausality confounds not only prediction of effect but also attribution of cause.
Since most effects seem caused rather than uncaused, and since the complexity of minds
makes them hard to predict, minds appear to have at least weak free will. Weak free will is
sufficient for assigning ethical responsibility to decision-making systems even in the face of
complete determinism.
Do minds have strong free will, or can their decisions in principle be inferred
from sufficient knowledge of prior circumstances?
Anti-materialists posit an immaterial soul or will that is free from
both deterministic causality and random acausality. This notion
violates the law of the excluded middle. Either the immaterial will
is subject to (perhaps probabilistic but nonetheless causal) causes,
or it is not. The same is true of material minds. The actions of an
immaterial will could be said to be caused by its own internal causal
processes, but the same can be said of material minds.
1.2.1.2. Philosophy / Epistemology / Philosophy Of Mind / Accidence of Mind
Non-essential but perhaps inevitable aspects of mind include subjectivity, intentionality, and affect.
Subjectivity
Objectivity is independence from a point of view or perspective that is inherently private. Subjectivity
is dependency on a point of view or perspective that is inherently private. Subjective experience is the
private phenomenal aspect of experience, the vivid feeling of what an experience is "like".
Subjective experience consists of complex associations among perceptions, and necessarily
occurs in systems having such associations. If a subjective experience is not "like" anything
(i.e. not associated with any other perceptions), it is not a subjective experience at all.
Physicalism is the thesis that all facts can be described in physical (and thus non-subjective) terms.
Some humans have what they call a "natural belief that collections of cells do not generate minds"
[McGinn 1999] and that therefore physicalism must be false.
Such a belief seems only as "natural" as the belief that collections
of atoms do not generate life, and just as unjustified. The operation
of e.g. the human brain does not mysteriously causeconsciousness, but
rather it simplyconstitutes consciousness.
Qualia are ineffable intrinsic subjective qualities of perception, such as the redness of red, beyond the
functional or dispositional properties of perception. Qualia are taken by opponents of physicalism to be
a mysterious phenomenon that physicalism cannot explain.
However, qualia do not exist, because the functional and
dispositional properties of perception can, in fact, explain the
subjective qualities of perception. The functional role of certain
sorts of perceptions in a conscious system necessarily and
understandably entails that the system will report qualia. Thus there
are no ineffable intrinsic subjective qualities of perception beyond
its functional qualities.
The Knowledge Argument is an argument made by Frank Jackson in 1982 purporting to show that
physicalism is false because knowledge of all the relevant physical facts does not include, for certain
experiences such as the redness of red, knowledge of what it is like to have them before they are had.
Jackson hypothesizes in the distant future a brilliant neuroscientist Mary spending her whole life in a
colorless room learning all the physical facts about seeing the color red. Jackson claims that only when
Mary sees something red can she learns the new fact of what redness is like, and that therefore
physicalism is false.
Jackson's argument fails because it ignores the difference between
memorizing an algorithm and executing it. The experience of the
redness of red consists in the operation of a complex set of
functional components for processing information. While we can
conceive of Mary having serial access to arbitrarily many memorized
facts about such components, we cannot conceive of her having a large
enough working memory or a fast enough mind to "manually" perform the
operations "in her head" in order to recreate the experience of
redness. Similarly, Mary could memorize the sequence of pixels in a
monochrome bitmap and yet still not be able to mentally visualize
what the bitmap will look like -- even if it is an image of a
favorite drawing which she had already memorized in arbitrary detail.
A zombie is a hypothetical creature that is stipulated to lack subjective experience but is behaviorally
and physically indistinguishable from a human. The conceivability or logical possibility of zombies is
taken by opponents of physicalism to show that physicalism is false.
It seems impossible to conceive of a creature that lacks subjective
experience but nevertheless exhibits all the self-reporting behaviors
of humans that help us to ascribe subjective experience to them. 
Therefore, zombies are inconceivable and do not show physicalism to
be false.
Intentionality
Intentionality is aboutness -- the property of being about, directed at, or suited for.
A system has intentionality by virtue of its potential and actual causal relations with the world.
The Chinese Room is a thought experiment devised by John Searle in 1980 to show that there cannot
be intentionality or understanding in a formal symbol manipulation system such as a room in which a
speaker of English manually executes an algorithm allowing the room to pass the Turing Test in
Chinese. Searle claims that intentionality "is a biological phenomenon, and it is as likely to be as
causally dependent on the specific biochemistry of its origins as lactation [or] photosynthesis". Searle
charges that functionalism is a form of dualism because it says mind is in principle independent of the
specific biochemistry of the brain.
The human in the Chinese Room does not understand Chinese, but the
human running the algorithm implements a system that does indeed
understand Chinese. The system has intentionality by virtue of the
causal relations that allow it to correctly answer questions posed to
it in Chinese. Intentionality is a formal or informational property,
whereas lactation and photosynthesis involve chemistry and energy.
Simulated thinking can indeed produce understanding, just as
simulated musical composition can indeed produce a sonata. If a
functional explanation of mind is "dualistic", then so is a
functional explanation of long division or carburetion.
Affect
Affect is a general and often undirected negative or positive attitude, beyond overall sensory or
cognitive state, that influences motive and colors perception. Is affect indeed an inevitable
property of any volitional system with complex motives?
1.2.1.3. Philosophy / Epistemology / Philosophy Of Mind / Relations of Mind
Mind and Object
Concepts are abstractions induced by minds from instances. Concepts are the products of
the not-fully-understood facility by which a mind induces general properties from instances, and are
themselves the not-fully-understood facility by which a mind recognizes those general properties in
other similar instances.Ideas are concepts. Universals are kinds or categories of terms that are related
according to shared properties. Human theories about universals are of three general kinds:
Realism is the thesis that universals are essences that have existence independent of any
instances.
● 
● Conceptualism is the thesis that universals exist only as mental concepts.
● Nominalism is the thesis that universals are merely names given to groups of similar instances.
Universals do not exist independently of the instances that instantiate them and the minds
that conceptualize them.
Mind and Minds
The Other Minds Problem is the problem of ascertaining whether external realty and other minds
actually exist or merely appear to exist. Solipsism is the thesis that external reality and other minds do
not actually exist. Solipsism incorrectly concludes not-X simply because X cannot be known with
absolute certainty, and thus ignores the preferred conclusion of probably-X.
Mind and Identity
A mind is identical with its closest close-enough continuous-enough continuer. Processes that
preserve mental (and thus personal) identity include:
● Deciding
● Incremental or continuous learning or forgetting
● Sleeping
● Locally continuous displacement through space, including e.g. teleportation via a portal
● Incremental transformation, e.g. through neuron-by-neuron replacement with computer chips
By contrast, the following processes do not preserve identity, usually because of being not
continuous or not continuous-enough:
● Sudden irreversible complete amnesia
● Discontinuous teleportation, e.g. through disassembly and reassembly
● Discontinuous transformation, e.g. through mind uploading or restoration
● Reincarnation
● Duplication
● Simulation
It is perhaps logically possible for a single mind to fission continuously into more than one, or for more
than one to continuously fuse into one, with identity being preserved in both cases. Chaotic or quantum
effects probably make such fission or fusion physically impossible, since they might make it
impossible to precisely synchronize the functioning of the duplicate components during the transition.
Mind and Spacetime
As noted by Dennett, the subjective sense of here -- the observer's spatial location -- is fixed by the
content of mental events, and not by their spatial location. The subjective sense of now -- the observer's
temporal location -- is similarly fixed by the content of mental events, and not by their temporal
location.
Materialism implies that consciousness is distributed over space and time in a material substrate of
mind such as the human brain. Thus there is no moment in time or point in
space at which a thought enters consciousness. Asking when precisely
did a material mind become conscious of an event is like asking when
precisely did the British Empire learn of the signing of the treaty
that ended the War of 1812. (The Battle of New Orleans was fought
two weeks after the treaty was signed, by soldiers that had not yet
heard of the signing.)
Mind and Artifact
Functionalism implies that, in principle, an artificial mind is possible, and that therefore a machine
could think.
TheTuring Test is an assay for intelligence in which an interrogator using teletyped queries attempts
to distinguish between a certified intelligence and a candidate intelligence. A rigorous interrogator
can pose lines of questioning that can only be answered by use of the perceptive inductions
that are the essence of intelligence. Not every intelligence could pass such a rigorous Turing
Test, but everything that passes such a Turing Test is an intelligence.
Roger Penrose argues that the human mind is not computable because, given a formalization of one's
mind and the Godel sentence for one's mind, a human mind allegedly could recognize the sentence as
true whereas the formalized computation could not. Penrose errs in assuming one could
know a formalization of one's mind and correctly believe in its
consistency. Godel's Theorem merely shows that any formalizable reasoning faculty
could not correctly believe in its own consistency.
Mind and Supermind
These are some of the levels of information-processing ability:
● Sentience is the capacity for sensation.
● Cognition is the process of learning, reasoning, and knowing.
● Consciousness is awareness of self and environment.
Intelligence is the ability to make, test, and apply inductions about perceptions of self
and world.
● 
Automentation is the ability of a mind to engineer all of its internal and external
information storage and processing.
● 
Automentation can be superior to regular intelligence in efficiency, flexibility, speed, capacity,
bandwidth, and network associativity, but not in cognition. There are no forms of reasoning or
kinds of knowledge that are in principle inaccessible to regular intelligence.
Mind and Limits
There are several ways in which minds are limited in theory and in practice.
Logical Limits
The Principle of Non-contradiction requires that no mind can correctly believe both a
proposition and its negation. Indeed, all of the conclusions of logic are binding on all possible
minds, as logic is in fact the study of valid inference.
● 
Computational Limits
If functionalism implies (as seems likely) that the logical limits on computability apply also to
all physically possible minds, then several implications follow.
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem would then imply that no mind with a formalizable
reasoning system can be both consistent and complete.
❍ 
Neither the Decision Problem for the predicate calculus nor the (equivalent) Halting
Problemcould be solved by any physically possible mind.
❍ 
Certain computational problems (such as sorting a list of N elements) could not be solved
by any physically possible mind in less than an amount of time that is a function (such as
log N) of the size of the problem.
❍ 
● 
Epistemological Limits
It seems likely that no mind could ever achieve
❍ apodictic certainty about synthetic knowledge; or
❍ a proof of God's existence.

Physical Limits
Bremermann's Limit is the maximum processing speed (2×1047 bits per second per
gram) of a self-contained material system. Bremermann's Limit derives from the
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and Einstein's principle of mass-energy equivalency.
The finite age and mass of the universe combine with Bremermann's Limit to constrain the
amount of thinking that any material mind can have done.
❍ 
❍ The Bekenstein Bound is the physical limit of information density.
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle implies that no mind can completely know the
momentum of a particle at a particular position in space, or the energy of a particle at a
particular moment in time.
❍ 
The finiteness of the speed of light limits how big and nimble a material mind can be, as
well as how far it can sense or influence circumstances.
❍ 
The laws of thermodynamics require that no material mind in a closed system can create
energy, decrease entropy, or indefinitely sustain a given level of operation.
❍ 
No material mind can travel backwards in time. The ability to do so would eliminate the
mind's computational limits and physical limits.
❍ 
● 
Biological Limits
Biological minds necessarily inherit a powerful drive to sustain self and kind. However,
● 
intelligence and volition can in principle allow a mind to overcome any such biological
imperative.
Psychological Limits
Human minds are subject to many psychological limits in the areas of memory, perception,
attention, concentration, volition, and cognition.

1.2.2. Philosophy / Epistemology / Philosophy Of Science
Philosophy Of Science: the study of scientific knowledge.
Definition of Science
Science is the study of regular objective phenomena through empirical induction and logical
deduction. The scientific method consists of observation and measurement, induction of hypotheses
and deduction of consequences, experimental or empirical testing of those consequences,
reproducibility of results, and competition for agreement in the marketplace of ideas.
Discovery is the learning of a principle or fact that was already in effect. Invention is the creation of a
method or mechanism that was not already in operation. A hypothesis is a rigorous explanation that
has not already been proven. 'Theory' can mean either a proven or unproven hypothesis. A fact is a
synthetic proposition that is demonstrably true. Principles and facts are discovered (not invented)
because they were already in effect. Theories are invented (not discovered) because the explaining that
they constitute was not already happening, even though the principle they describe might have been. 
Thus, Darwin can be said both to have invented the theory of evolution and to have discovered the
principle of evolution.
Scientific Provisionality
The propositions of science are mainly synthetic ones, and the truth of any synthetic
proposition is provisional and subject to revision according to new evidence or better
interpretation of evidence. Science tends to converge asymptotically and almost
monotonically on truth.
Critics of skepticism point to the scientific revolutions in the past
to question the validity of what science asserts in the present. 
They cite Kuhn's theory of paradigms, Einstein's transcendence of
Newton, discoveries of unforeseen physical forces and particles,
various premature announcements of the end of physics, and various
incorrect predictions of technological barriers.
First, technology and science are different. Those who incorrectly
denied the technological possibility of powered or supersonic flight
did not deny the scientific reality of birds or gunshots.
Second, science in the past left vast swaths of phenomena
unexplained. The darkness of infinite star-filled space was
considered Olber's Paradox until well into the 20th century. The Sun
was a marvel of inexplicable energy as recently as 1900. Disease and
heredity and the blueness of the sky were still unexplained in 1850.
Electricity and magnetism were spooky curiosities as recently as
1800. In 2000 there were still big mysteries about purposes and
origins, but fewer marvels about what some phenomenon might possibly
be. Perhaps humanity's biggest marvel in 2000 was quantum action at
a distance, followed distantly by minor marvels like dark matter,
gamma ray bursters, and high-temperature superconductivity. Even a
phenomenon as marvelous as mind has been demonstrated to be
neurological -- although diehard dualists insist that consciousness
is a true marvel.
Third, science converges toward truth even across some paradigm
shifts. The Earth is still spheroid and still moves around the Sun,
even though the Sun is now known to not be the center of the
universe. Gravity still obeys Newton's inverse square law, even
though relativity now explains gravity as geometry instead of as
force. Momentum is still conserved, even though mass and energy are
interconvertible. Since roughly the time of Darwin, there have been
very few big questions for which science gave answers that were not
even approximately correct. Perhaps the biggest mistakes in this time
were the underestimations of the age and size of the universe.
Finally, humanity is now clearly converging on answers to the biggest
scientific questions.
Science's Big Questions
The most interesting phenomena in nature are mind, life, and the universe itself. The big questions of
natural science seek the origin, mechanism and fate of mind, life, and the universe. Before the 1860's,
humans had only the beginnings of an answer to only one of these questions. Newton and a few others
had figured out part of the mechanism of the universe, but the other eight questions were answered
with a combination of biblical myths and wild guesses. By the end of the 1960's, humanity had, for all
nine questions, outlined answers that will probably still be considered correct in two hundred, two
thousand, and two million years.
What is the origin of the universe? Spacetime itself and all the mass-energy in it were created
in the Big Bang some 15 billion years ago. Humans are beginning to understand how the laws of
physics allowed for the Big Bang to happen, and are even proposing reasons why the laws of
physics have to be as they are. However, it may not be knowable why the laws of physics exist
at all.
● 
What is the mechanism of the universe? The universe consists of fermions and bosons
interacting through gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Humans
can accurately model those interactions using General Relativity and the Standard Model of
particle physics, and may be close to combining these two theories into a unified theory of the
universe.
● 
What is the fate of the universe? There appears not to be enough mass in the universe to halt
its (perhaps asymptotic) expansion into a vast emptiness growing steadily colder and darker.
Humans will soon know whether, on the other hand, there is enough mass to eventually reverse
the expansion and collapse the universe in a hot Big Crunch.
● 
What is the origin of life? Life based on ribonucleic and amino acids arose on Earth four
billion years ago as a result of auto-catalytic chemical processes of increasing complexity. 
Humans are only beginning to understand the details of these processes and how improbable
they might have been.
● 
● What is the mechanism of life? Life on earth operates according to the basic principles of 
biochemistry and develops through evolution by natural selection. Humans will long be filling
in the details of molecular and cellular biology and tracing the history of evolution.
What is the fate of life? Due to senescence or chance, individual organisms eventually die; and
due to environment or chance, species usually evolve or become extinct. Humans are beginning
to understand and protect the ecosystem of Earth, and are investigating possible ecosystems
elsewhere.
● 
What is the origin of mind? Intelligence developed slowly over the last million or two years
among social post-arboreal omnivorous tool-using bipedal primates, resulting in language by 50
Kya or 100 Kya. Humans are investigating precisely how intelligence evolved on earth, how
improbable it was, and whether it has arisen elsewhere. Humans may never develop definitive
answers to these questions.
● 
What is the mechanism of mind? The human mind is the result of electrochemical neural
processes in the human brain, and artificial minds seem producible from simpler functional
components. Detailed understanding of mental mechanisms will require lots of engineering and
even more reverse-engineering.
● 
What is the fate of mind? The human mind and personality cease to exist when the human
brain ceases to function. Humans may someday be able to extend the function of the brain
indefinitely.
● 
Why Science Works
Humans sometimes ask: why does science work so well? The answer has two parts. First, the universe
turns out to consist fundamentally of Nature and not Spirit: of lawlike and unwilled objective
regularity, as opposed to randomness or mysterious volition. Second, science's method of skeptical
empiricism and competition between ideas is better at elucidating the universe's regularity than are
alternative methods like faith and mysticism. If the universe were in fact fundamentally controlled by
volition, then faith would work better than science. If the universe were in fact fundamentally
subjective (at the level of understanding and not merely observation), then mysticism would work
better than science. Note that a very important aspect of the universe is in fact mysteriously volitional:
the behavior of living and conscious systems. However, the volition of these systems is now
confidently believed to be not a fundamental aspect of the universe, but rather an epiphenomenon of
fundamental lawlike and unwilled regularities. While science can show that life and mind arose as
epiphenomena, science must work hard to find regularities in the complex behaviors of such systems. 
The complexity appears irreducible, and there is no prospect that faith or mysticism will in these areas
ever work better than science.
Science has been so spectacularly successful in the last 150 years
that people tend to consider it to be a self-contained worldview
independent or inclusive of its entire philosophical foundation.
Science as a method would still work quite well if naturalism and
materialism were false in the ways proposed by their opponents. The
success of science is not a completely dispositive argument against
supernaturalism or anti-materialism, though it of course provides
much of the raw materials for attempting such an argument. We should
resist the urge to say that some philosophical positions are more
scientific than others, because philosophy is more fundamental than
science and deals with issues that are almost entirely outside
science's domain.
1.3. Philosophy / Axiology
Axiology: the study of values.
1. Ethics: the study of how individual persons should affect other persons and other beings.
2. Political Philosophy: the study of how groups of persons should affect persons and other beings.
3. Virtue Philosophy: the study of how individual persons should conduct themselves.
4. Aesthetics: the study of beauty.
Definition of Values
A value is, in Philosophy, a principle or standard for considering something good or bad. Good is
being pleasant or fit for a chosen purpose. Bad is being unpleasant or unfit for a chosen purpose. Right
is accordance of a decision or outcome with ultimate (and not just proximate) goodness. Wrongis
discordance of a decision or outcome with ultimate (and not just proximate) goodness.
Origin of Values
Values derive from intentions and appetites. Appetites are desires arising from capacities for pleasure
and pain. Innate appetites are usually the result of evolutionary pressure for inclusive reproductive
fitness. However, appetites can conflict with each other, with long-term inclusive fitness, and with
intentions. An intention is a desire for a chosen goal. Happiness is the tendency of a being to have its
appetites satisfied and intentions fulfilled.
The ultimate goal of most humans is self-preservation in any of three ways:
● personal survival: continuation of one's body, mind, and "soul"
● genetic survival: continuation of one's family
● memetic survival: continuation of one's memory and creations
A minority of humans choose alternative goals, such as pleasure, pain, knowledge, beauty, compassion,
justice, ecosystemic survival, capability, serenity, or annihilation
An intrinsic value is a value which derives from an intention or appetite that is an end in itself, and is
not purely instrumental to other intentions and appetites. An ultimate value is an intrinsic value the
pursuit of which is not compromised by the pursuit of any other value.
Justification of Values
Humans have no evidence that the universe has an inherent objective purpose, and so the
universe has no goal whose desiring could be the basis of a value. The universe is not
inherently either good or bad, and neither are the appetites of humans and other known
beings in it.
In the absence of objective purpose or inherently good or bad appetites, humans seem free to
choose their own purposes and values. Can there be an objective rational basis for
values? It does not seem impossible, but no human choice of values has been shown to be
justifiable through objective reason alone. Instead, such choices must ultimately be based at
least in part on appeal to appetites rather than to reason. This resort to arational appeal can
be minimized by using it just to choose fundamental values, or better yet the criteria for
choosing fundamental values. Several criteria for choosing fundamental values seem
appealing:
Universality is, in Axiology, the principle that to hold a fundamental value is to
advocate it being held by all relevantly similar valuers.
● 
Impartiality is, in Axiology, the principle that a fundamental value cannot favor a
particular thing over other relevantly similar things.
● 
Maximality is, in Axiology, the principle that if a value is fundamental then there being
too much of it is impossible.
● 
Compatibility is, in Axiology, the principle that fundamental values must be relatively
compatible with the natural appetites and desires of the valuer.
● 
Humans divide into several schools of thought regarding the justification of values.
Cognitivism is, in Axiology, the thesis that propositions about values can be objectively true or
false.
Naturalism is, in Axiology, the thesis that the truth of propositions about values can be
derived from facts about nature.
❍ 
Intuitionism is, in Axiology, the thesis that the truth of propositions about values can only
be derived from self-evident intuitions.
❍ 
● 
Noncognitivism is, in Axiology, the thesis that propositions about values cannot be objectively
true or false.
Emotivism is, in Axiology, the thesis that propositions about values reduce to emotional
expressions of approval and disapproval.
❍ 
Prescriptivism is, in Axiology, the thesis that propositions about values reduce to
exhortations and prohibitions.
❍ 
● 
Naturalism is incorrect because there is no compelling way to argue
from 'is' to 'ought'. Intuitionism is incorrect because the axioms
about values are not self-evident in the way that are, say, the
axioms of mathematics. Both Emotivism and Prescriptivism are
partially correct, because assertions of values indeed have emotive
and prescriptive force, and are not objectively descriptive.
Asserted Values
In a universe condemned to inexorably increasing entropy, we value extropy. Extropy is the
amount of a system's intelligence, vitality, and capability for increasing its intelligence, vitality,
and capability. As autonomous living intellects, we persons value intelligence and life and the
autonomy they need to flourish.
Intelligence. We value not just information and knowledge. We value understanding and
wisdom and especially the intelligence that both produces and includes
them. Understanding is knowledge that is fundamental, recursive, and reflexive: it is central
and irreducible, it supports and implies much other derivative knowledge, and it fixes itself
and its knower in the landscape of other knowledge. Wisdom is the understanding of both
one's purpose and how best to pursue it.
Life. We value the complexity and organized diversity that lies between rigid order and
random chaos. Systems like life that undergo evolution by natural selection are the best
source of such complexity and organized diversity.
Autonomy. We value the autonomy that is required by life and intelligence in order for them
to flourish. Life needs autonomy to pursue the self-interest necessary for preservation of self
and kind. Intelligence needs autonomy to question assumptions and authority. We value
justice, which allows each agent to enjoy the reasonably expectable results of its decisions
and non-coercive actions.
Value Systems
The major human value systems are:
● Pietism is the thesis that the ultimate value is devotion to supernatural agency.
● Collectivism is the thesis that the ultimate value is the good of persons in groups.
Individualism is the thesis that the ultimate value is the good of persons as individuals.
Eudaimonism is the thesis that ultimate value lies in individual happiness.
Utilitarianism is the thesis that the ultimate value is the greatest happiness for the
greatest number.
■ 
■ Hedonism is the thesis that the ultimate value is pleasure.
■ Asceticism is the thesis that the ultimate value is serenity.
■ Egoism is the thesis that the ultimate value is one's own happiness.
❍ 
❍ Stoicism is the thesis that the ultimate value is virtue.
❍ Existentialism is the thesis that ultimate values are created only by individual choices.
● 
● Survivalism is the thesis that the ultimate value is inclusive reproductive fitness.
● Pessimism is the thesis that ultimate values are irrelevant.
● Deontologism is the thesis that ultimate value derives from rational imperative.
● Altruism is the thesis that the ultimate value is the happiness of others.
● Extropianism is the thesis that the ultimate value is extropy.
Pietism fails because there is no credible evidence of any
supernatural agency. Collectivism fails because it is incompatible
with the rights and incentives of individuals. Utilitarianism
underdefines goodness as happiness. Hedonism fails because simple
sensual pleasure eventually conflicts with more complex goals.
Asceticism fails because it attempts to suppress natural appetites
and intentions. Egoism fails because the inviolability of personal
liberty eventually conflicts with its maximal protection. Stoicism
underdefines goodness as virtuousness. Existentialism and Pessimism
mistake important insights to be the last word. Survivalism commits
the Naturalist Fallacy that the way things are naturally is the way
one should want things to be. Deontologism too is a form of
Naturalism that wrongly concludes 'ought' from 'is'. Altruism both
conflicts with and fails to harness natural appetites and intentions.
If the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics didn't guarantee that entropy effectively always increases,
then life would perhaps evolve runaway godlike powers, and those gods might not value
extropy so much. What would an omnipotent omniscience value? worship?
companionship? beauty? serenity? forgetfulness? oblivion?
1.3.1. Philosophy / Axiology / Ethics
Ethics: the study of how individual persons should affect other persons and other beings.
Nature of Ethics
Ethics consists in identifying the rights that each kind of entity has. A right is an entitlement of a being
that persons will or will not affect it in a specified way.
Extropian Ethics
A being is any entity possessing life, sentience, or intelligent volition, and are the only entities
that have rights. There are two classes of beings: persons and organisms. A person is any
intelligent being with significant volitional control over how it affects other beings.
● All persons have the right to life and liberty.
● All beings have the right not to suffer torture or extinction.
Thus persons are obligated to minimize the incidence of
● deaths of persons;
● extinctions of species;
● aggression; and
● torture.
Subjects of Ethics
Groups. Groups of individual beings do not have volition or sentience, and cannot be subject
to coercion or torture except insofar as their individual members are so subject. Thus groups
per se have no separate right against coercion or torture. There is a sense in which some
groups -- species -- are alive, and so species have the right not to suffer extinction.
Sub-Persons? A dependent person is a person who has less than the normal amount of
intelligence, volition, or physiological independence. A guardian is a person who is
responsible for the well-being of a dependent person and to that end may coerce that
dependent person. Minor children are dependent persons, and their parents are usually their
guardians. The other major group of dependent persons are the mentally disabled.
Cetaceans and apes are not intelligent enough to be considered even dependent persons.
Super-Persons? No amount of mental or physical power makes any entity deserve more
rights than persons. Bioengineered and artificial beings are fully persons if they meet the tests
of intelligence and volition.
Pre-Persons. A being is also a person if it is of a kind that ordinarily are or become persons
and has either significant cognition or both sentience and physiological independence. Viable
human fetuses thus are dependent persons, in the same sense that minor children are.
Genotypes of persons are not themselves persons, and have no right not to be modified.
Post-Persons. A person ceases to be a person when it permanently loses its life,
intelligence, or volition. A person must be considered a dependent person if he does not want
personal responsibility for any intermittent loss of intelligence or volition.
Personal Identity. A person is identified through time with its closest close-enough
continuous-enough continuer. A person P1 constituted from the description and even
materials of a person P0 is not identified with P0 if the constitution process is discontinuous. It
is logically possible to duplicate a person, even though the duplicate would not share in the
identity of the person and would have the ethical status of a child of the original's age. It is
also logically possible to split a person such that all continuers are equally close and all are
close and continuous enough to preserve identity. In this case the continuers would share
equally the predecessor's identity, and would have to assign among themselves all of the
predecessor's unsharable personal and property relations. Similar reasoning applies to joined
persons.
Organisms. Impersonal organisms may be owned by persons, and may be coerced or killed
by their owning person or (if unowned and unaccessed) by any person. Genotypes of
organisms are not themselves alive, and thus have no independent right against extinction.
Bioengineered and artificial beings have the full rights of organisms if they meet the test of
being alive.
Objects of Ethics
Property is anything that an agency has the exclusive right to possess, use, and assign.
Property can be anything that is not a person and that can be created or controlled by a
person.
● 
A person has a right to access any unowned resource to which they have been
exercising continuing access.
● 
● A person owns any unowned unaccessed thing over which he exerts original control.
● A person owns anything he creates from his property and resources rights.
A person owns any property, property right, or resource right consensually assigned by
its rightful owner.
● 
Each property, property right, and resource right of a person, upon his death, either
goes to a chosen assignee or reverts to being unowned.
● 
A resource is any physical or logical supply or space which exists without intelligent
sustenance and is easy to use in part but hard to control as a whole, such as air, land, water,
pollution sinks, sunlight, wind, views, fish, game, minerals, meteorites, space, orbits,
bandwidth, public namespaces, etc. Polluting or monopolizing a resource is aggression
against the persons who have been exercising continuing access to it. A possessable
resource is one, such as land or sunlight, of which a part may be controlled such that any
outsider's use of it is easily detectable by the controller. Even privatized property interests in
unpossessable resources are subject to the tragedy of the commons, because the owner
cannot readily identify who is violating his interest.
Property can consist only of possessable resources, artifacts, and intellectual property.
An artifact is any material thing created by an intelligence. Intellectual property is property
consisting of an original creation of information, including expressions (but not facts),
inventions (but not discoveries), and reputations. Copyright is the right to reproduce an
original expression such as text, images, audio, video, sculpture, or dance. Apatent is the
property right over an original invention. A reputation is the public or commercial esteem or
identity of a person or a person's property. Defamation is damage to a reputation through
deceptive expression.
Original expressions are the intellectual property of their creator or his assignee, but should
not be granted full copyright. When media reproduction and distribution was expensive and its
ownership concentrated, copyright had the primary effect of ensuring commercial exclusivity
rather than preventing non-competing or "fair" use. Digital technologies have made media
reproduction and distribution asymptotically free, and so archaic copyright doctrine finds itself
opposed to uses which cannot be prevented. (Although not protected by copyright, there
seems to be no shortage of expressions such as fashions, jokes, and bumper stickers.)
Ownership of expression should give only the right to prevent its reproduction in cases of a)
competition that diverts commercial benefit from the owner to the competitor, b) attributed use
with unattributed defamatory modification, and c) unattributed use of any kind. Intellectual
property in reputations should be recognized for as long as the commercial utility of those
reputations. Anti-competition rights in expressions should be recognized for only as long as it
might have taken before someone else created the same original expression. (For most
expressions, this duration would be indefinite.) Intellectual property in an invention should be
recognized for only as long as it might have taken before someone else invented it, or for as
long as the ordinary product lifecycle in the relevant industry, whichever is longer.
Ethical Relations
Persons have no right to inflict negative externalities impacting property and resource rights,
and no right to demand compensation for positive externalities.
Cooperation is the interaction among persons for mutual benefit. Cooperation is usually
positive-sum even for direct and reversible exchanges, because the exchanging persons
have differing needs or values. The right of association is the right of persons, except in
cases of anti-competitive monopoly, to cooperate or decline to cooperate with whom they
choose. Cooperation can take many forms. A contract is an explicit understanding among
consenting agents to exchange with or affect each other in a specified way. Marriage is a
form of contract that unites many of the property rights and liabilities of the marrying persons.
Aggression is the violation by a person of another person's rights, and consists only of:
personal injury, damage to property, infringement of resource rights, coercion, fraud,
anti-competitive monopoly, or inducement or deceptive incitement of third parties to any of
these. Coercion is compulsion of one person by another through force or threat of
aggression. Fraud is any attempt to profit by deceiving a person into making a choice
intended to cause him economic harm relative to what would have been his undeceived
choice. Deception is the statement of demonstrable falsehoods or the omission of relevant
truths that has the intentional effect of encouraging a false belief in another person. Theft is
the unjust and non-consensual taking of property from its rightful owner. Anti-competitive
monopoly is the intentional control or denial of a person's participation in an industry by the
coordinated action of the person(s) controlling that industry. Torture is the infliction of pain on
any being as a result of the sadistic intention or callous negligence of a person.
Competition is the contrary efforts of persons to win the consent of some other person(s) to
associate in some way. The infliction of opportunity costs through non-monopolistic
competition does not by itself constitute aggression. Expression is only aggression if it
involves deception that intentionally or negligently causes actual harm or serious risk thereof,
for example by yelling "fire!" in a crowded (but not burning) theater. Non-deceptive incitement
to aggression is not itself aggression.
Justice is the minimization, reversal and punishment of aggression. Injustice is
unminimized, unreversed, or unpunished aggression. The minimization of coercion can itself
justify a minimal amount of coercion. Coercion should be reversed by payment of damages
or, if possible, reparation of the original property or access rights to the coerced persons.
Serious coercion should be punished by loss of freedom, personal interaction, and even life.
Liberty is volition in the absence of aggression. Thus justice can also be defined as the most
liberty for the most persons. Freedom is significant volition: the power of making significant
decisions about an agent's own actions. The freedoms of two persons can be in complete
conflict, but their liberties by definition cannot.
1.3.2. Philosophy / Axiology / Political Philosophy
Political Philosophy: the study of how groups of persons should affect persons and other beings.
The State
A state is an organization of persons that has control and sovereignty over a particular region and the
persons in it.
Purpose of the state
To meet their obligation to minimize death, extinction, aggression, and torture, the persons in
a region join together in a social contract to create or authorize the state. The purpose of the
state is to
● Effect justice (the minimization, reversal, and punishment of aggression);
● Provide aid and sustenance to persons in mortal danger;
● Protect species in danger of extinction;
● Prevent torture;
● Regulate natural monopolies; and
● Provide public goods.
Duties of the state
The specific duties of the state are therefore to
Minimize, reverse, and punish foreign aggression
❍ Deter and defend against foreign attack
❍ Regulate international trade
❍ Manage annexations and secessions
● 
Minimize, reverse, and punish domestic aggression
Minimize, reverse, and punish coercion
■ Prevent force and fraud
■ Protect property
■ Enforce contracts
Protect resource rights
■ Protect ongoing access to unowned resources
■ Collect rent for use (e.g. pollution) of unpossessable resources
■ 
■ Regulate bankruptcy
■ Regulate incorporation
❍ 
● 
Minimize, reverse, and punish anti-competitive monopolies
■ Regulate natural monopolies
■ Prevent anti-competitive artificial monopolies
❍ 
Provide aid and sustenance to citizens and residents in mortal danger, such as
❍ the indigent
❍ dependent persons with no guardian
● 
● Prevent torture
● Protect species and ecosystems
Powers of the state
The powers of the state necessary for carrying out its duties are to
Tax - a taking of property by a state from a class of its subjects according to rule
ordained in a duly enacted law.
❍ Establish a currency as legal tender for public debts
Collect rent for use of unpossessable resources
■ Tax resource consumption and pollution
■ Rent resource access to the highest bidders
❍ 
❍ Tax consumption, income, or trade
● 
Take or regulate private property for fair compensation, to help to
❍ Regulate natural monopolies
❍ Prevent anti-competitive artificial monopolies
Prevent threats to public safety such as epidemic, flood, pestilence, and weapons
of mass destruction
❍ 
❍ Protect species and ecosystems
● 
● Establish police and regulatory services to prevent domestic aggression
● Establish a military to minimize, reverse, and punish foreign aggression
● Establish a judiciary to try cases of fact and law
Regulate the definition of personhood for elections, citizenship, adulthood, marriage,
incorporation
● 
● Manage spaces annexed or donated to the state
Restrictions on the state
In no case may the state
● Commit torture
● Restrict any person's non-coercive expression or belief
● Establish or endorse any religion
● Treat persons inequitably on the basis of ethnicity, sex, age, or belief
● Deny any person equal representation
● Compel labor, except through wartime military conscription
● Take property without fair compensation
Confiscate or tax wealth or inheritance, as opposed to the change in wealth through
consumption, income, or trade
● 
● Search or seize persons or property without a warrant of probable cause
● Compel self-incrimination
Annex a space without the consent of a supermajority of the persons residing or owning
property or accessing resources there
● 
Permit the secession of a region if
❍ a supermajority in the region does not approve, or
❍ secession threatens the security of the state, or
❍ the region would get a free ride from the state's exercise of its duties.
● 
Organization of the state
The state should practice the principle of federalism, so that each governmental function is
performed by the most local unit of government that can perform it. The state should have
separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The citizens of the state should
exercise their power through elected representatives rather than directly through plebiscites.
Laws of the state
Contracts. The state should enforce contracts and thus prevent the coercion of one
contracting person by the other. A person must exist to be coerced, and so covenants are
not enforceable if no person has been assigned the guarantee constituted by the covenant. 
The state should regulate bankruptcy to prevent the theft that occurs when a bankrupt debtor
assigns assets to one creditor over another.
Corporations. The state should allow the incorporation of fictitious persons for commercial
purposes, with limited liability and equal ownership and control for each shareholder, as long
as at least one shareholder agrees to unlimited liability. Thus corporations should be an
elaborate form of limited partnership, where at least one full partner retains full personal
liability for the corporation's debts.
Monopoly. Artificial monopoly should only be regulated to the extent it is anti-competitive. An
important example of anti-competitive monopoly is when all the firms in an industry or region
refuse to do commerce with employees or customers of a certain race. A natural monopoly
is a continuous physical network that needs to reach almost every piece of property in a
region, such as roads and distribution networks (but not sources or sinks) for water,
electricity, natural gas, sewage, and wired telecommunications. Since the market cannot
efficiently regulate natural monopolies, the state should do so.
Political Philosophies
The most influential human political philosophies differ primarily according to the extent to which they
advocate state control of resources and private economic associations.
Anarchism is the political system holding that the state should not exist because coercion is
never permissible.
● 
● Libertarianism is the political system holding that the state exists only to minimize coercion.
Welfare Statism is the political system holding that the state should protect civil liberties,
regulate unequal private economic association, and provide social insurance.
● 
Socialism is the political system holding that the state should protect civil liberties, regulate
unequal private economic association, provide social insurance, and monopolize certain
industries and resources.
● 
● Communism is the political system holding that the state should monopolize all capital.
Libertarianism protects rights and promotes prosperity better than any other political system.
Anarchism fails to minimize coercion because it favors liberty's
theoretical inviolability over its practical protection.
Anarchism fails to
Prevent coercion by strong persons and aggressive foreign
states
❍ 
❍ Prevent aggressive use or pollution of unowned resources
❍ Prevent unfair treatment of creditors by bankrupt debtors
❍ Regulate natural monopolies
❍ Prevent anti-competitive artificial monopolies
❍ Provide aid and sustenance to the indigent
❍ Prevent torture and extinction of organisms
● 
Welfare Statism violates the right of free economic association,
and hinders prosperity by imposing inefficient regulations on
the free market. The fundamental ethical mistake of Welfare
Statism is the notion that it can be coercive (outside
anti-competitive monopolies) for private parties to freely
associate or decline to associate . For example, Welfare Statism
holds that no adult should be free to sell labor for less than
some government-determined minimum wage.
● 
Socialism violates rights of property and economic association,
and hinders prosperity with inefficient regulations and
collectives. The fundamental ethical mistake of Socialism is the
notion that some industries or resources should not ever be
private property.
● 
Communism eliminates property rights, and thereby cripples
economic prosperity. The fundamental ethical mistake of
Communism is the labor theory of value, which holds that value
comes only from labor and that profit from capital ownership is
exploitation.

1.3.3. Philosophy / Axiology / Virtue Philosophy
Virtue Philosophy: the study of how individual persons should conduct themselves.
Virtue
Virtue is any tendency or capacity to choose or behave in way that is good.
● Wisdom is the highest virtue.
● Fortitude is the capacity to overcome fear and endure misfortune.
● Temperance is the moderation of the appetites.
● Fairness is the practice of justice and the equitable reciprocation of cooperation.
● Kindness is sympathy and helpfulness.
In Greek philosophy the first four of these virtues were known as the
natural or cardinal virtues. Christianity added the so-called
theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Faith in and hope
for divine providence are misplaced. Wisdom entails not faith but
skepticism, and the combination of wisdom and fortitude yields an
optimism that is better than empty hope. As a theological virtue,
charity (or love of God) is also hollow, as God does not exist.
The Eightfold Path is a prescription by Buddha of a middle path said to lie between asceticism and
hedonism and said to end the suffering caused by desire.
1. Right Understanding: see things as they are.
2. Right Intention: resolve to follow the Path.
3. Right Speech: abstain from deception.
4. Right Action: practice compassion, abstain from aggression.
5. Right Livelihood: choose work compatible with the Path.
6. Right Effort: promote good and avoid evil.
7. Right Mindfulness: be aware of your thoughts, words, and actions.
8. Right Concentration: meditate on Oneness.
The Eightfold Path mistakenly assumes that no value can be maximal --
that any value can be desired too much. This is not true for values
like extropy, intelligence, and justice.
The Golden Rule is the precept of reciprocity advocated by the Old Testament (Leviticus 19:18 c. 700
BCE), Jainism (Sutrakritanga 1.11.33, c. 500 BCE), Confucius (Analects 15:23, c. 500 BCE), Plato (c.
400 BCE), Jesus (Matthew 7:12, c. 30 CE) and others.
The Golden Rule's ethical value of reciprocity does not satisfy the
axiological criteria of maximality and compatibility and so cannot by
itself be a satisfactory system of ethics. However, when applied to
meta-ethics it becomes the axiological criterion of universality,
similar to Kant's categorical imperative.
Vice
Vice is any tendency to choose or behave in a way that is bad. The major human vices include:
Sloth
❍ Boredom, Ennui
● 
Timidity
❍ Superstition
❍ Cowardice
❍ Shyness
❍ Technophobia, Neophobia
❍ Hypochondria
● 
Intemperance
Gluttony for:
■ Fats
■ Sweets
❍ 
● 
Addiction to Psychotropics:
Stimulants
■ Caffeine, Nicotine
■ Cocaine, Amphetamines
■ Cannabis, Psychedelics
■ 
Depressants
■ Sedatives: Alcohol, Barbiturates
■ Narcotics (Opiates)
■ 
❍ 
Lust
■ Fornication: Adultery, Prostitution
■ Masturbation, Pornography
❍ 
Risk-taking
■ Gambling
❍ 
Greed
Prodigality
■ Gambling
❍ 
❍ Covetousness
❍ Envy
● 
Malice
❍ Sexism, Homophobia
❍ Racism, Xenophobia
❍ Religious Bigotry
● 
Humans free to engage in vice can seriously harm themselves, as through intemperance or prodigality.
Should every competent adult human be free to harm himself through vice, or
are some vices so self-detrimental that the state should regulate them? Society
and the state should try to use persuasion rather than coercion to discourage vice.
The Ten Commandments are the rules of conduct given by Yahweh to Moses in Exodus 20:1-17,
prescribing worship of Yahweh and honor for parents while prohibiting killing, adultery, theft, false
witness, and covetousness.
Of the Ten Commandments, the first four indicate an insecure god
afraid of losing his authority. Only three commandments can be
related to sensible legal prohibitions (against murder, theft, and
perjury/fraud). The remaining three commandments should in a free
society only have the force of good advice.
Evil is either of sadism or injustice. Sadism is any person's practice of taking pleasure in another
being's unhappiness as an end in itself. Humans are not by nature necessarily sadistic or unjust, but
they are, like all known organisms, naturally self-interested. Like being alive, being self-interested is
almost always a necessary cause of being unjust, but that makes neither life nor self-interest necessarily
evil. Humans, like all known social organisms, are naturally cooperative. Humans are not by nature
necessarily evil, but their natural self-interest gives them a natural capacity for evil. In their natural
social environment of family and community, humans tend naturally to be more good than
evil, and to cooperate for mutual benefit.
Choosing Human Values
All persons should
● protect personal life and liberty and prevent torture and extinction;
● practice virtue and resist vice; and
● choose and pursue their values.
Humans should value love, family, fellowship, and industry.
Love is strong affection and devotion. Romantic love is deep and intimate affection and
devotion involving sensual passion, reproductive desire, and mutual unity of interest. Each
human should seek a mate with whom he or she has mutual sensual attraction, shared
values, and compatible temperament. Humans should seek a mate by applying a balance of
these three criteria, and by balancing short-term pleasure and convenience against long-term
happiness. Romantic love is worth making efforts and taking risks, and finding it thus requires
wisdom and fortitude. If circumstances preclude finding it, then living happily without it also
requires wisdom and fortitude.
Family. Humans should honor the memories of their ancestors. Humans should respect and
repay the devotion of their parents. Human siblings and cousins should provide each other
fellowship and aid. Humans should have as many children as they can provide with a
materially and emotionally sound upbringing. Humans should instill in their children personal
virtues and extropian and human values.
Fellowship is the enjoyment of human company through the sharing of ideas, humor,
competition, industry, or fun.
Industry is economic, intellectual, or artistic production. Humans should practice industry to
provide for their material well-being and to satisfy their appetite for learning and feeling useful.
Humans should throughout their lives try to improve their understanding of the foundations
and frontiers of human knowledge. Humans should choose careers that balance their
personal interests and temperament with occupations of high or increasing economic
productivity.
Practicing Human Virtues
Wisdom. Though humans know no easy formula for wisdom, certain practices recommend
themselves. A person should seek knowledge, especially knowledge of self and
meta-knowledge -- knowledge about one's and others' knowledge. A person should apply the
methods of skepticism, positivism, empiricism, and science. A person should identify and
question his assumptions, and test his most cherished beliefs against the best criticism of
them -- and alternatives to them -- that he can find. For any proposition in question, a person
should ask:
Under what conditions could it possibly be true? Under what conditions could it possibly
be false?
● 
● What implications follow from its truth or falsity?
What are the best arguments and evidence for and against it? Is it verifiable? Is it
falsifiable?
● 
● Under what conditions could a person conceivably believe it?
● Who said it? What is their authority and possible motivation?
Perspective is essential for conducting life wisely. For any decision which is (or might seem)
important, a person should ask himself:
● What difference will it make in three months, years, decades, and centuries?
● Which decision do I want to remember myself as having made?
● What would I decide if others were observing my deliberations?
● What if everyone made the same decision in such circumstances?
A person should consider what he would want his tombstone and obituary to say. A person
should minimize regrets, by balancing the expected outcome of each decision with any future
regrets for not making alternative decisions.
Fortitude. Misfortune inflicted by persons should be rebelled against. The cost of rebellion
should be weighed against not just the direct benefits but also the opportunity costs to other
persons of not rebelling.
Natural misfortune exists for the same reason that natural fortune exists: the universe is
neither benevolent nor malevolent. Misfortune inflicted by nature should not be compounded
by useless resentment. The misfortunate should seek to evoke in others not co-misery but
empathy and appreciation for relative fortune. The unrealized possibility of even worse
misfortune should not make the misfortunate happy, but it should make them less unhappy
and help them avoid compounding unhappiness. Suicide should only be considered as an
alternative to unavoidable and terminal physiological torment.
Misfortune is any harm one experiences, other than injustice, that can be seen as beyond one's control.
Some of the dimensions of misfortune are:
Harm
❍ Death
❍ Disability
❍ Illness, injury
❍ Loss, opportunity cost
● 
Victim
❍ Being
❍ Nationality
❍ Civilization
❍ Species
❍ Ecosystem
❍ Universe
● 
Relation
❍ Self
Relative
■ Child, other descendent
■ Parent, other ancestor
■ Sibling, cousin, etc.
❍ 
● 
❍ Mate, in-law, step-relative
❍ Associate
Agency
❍ Self
❍ Negligence
❍ Chance
● 
Fear is natural and healthy, but should be overcome through wisdom when it is not fully
warranted. Similarly, wisdom should promote fear when ignorance or impulsiveness prevents
it from mounting. Humans generally fear too little for their long-term safety and well-being,
and too much for their short-term social repute. (Perhaps this is because the latter determined
the former for much of the history of the human species.) Human adults only get around
20,000 days to spend, and any one of them wasted can never be refunded. No day should be
pass unused simply for short-term fears, and future days should not be squandered on
risk-seeking or revenge. Only for the protection of life and liberty is the risk of heroic
self-sacrifice advisable -- and sometimes obligatory.
Temperance. Humans should seek the maximum pleasure for themselves and other beings
that is consistent with their fundamental human and personal values. Pleasure, even if
natural, should not itself be a fundamental human value, for several reasons.
Humans for the most part cannot choose what will appeal to their appetites and senses,
and so hedonism constitutes surrender of the mind and slavery to the body.
● 
● Single-minded pursuit of sensual pleasure inevitably conflicts with other values.
Most somatic pleasures require ever-increasing stimulation, probably because nature
selects against organisms that can find unlimited pleasure in pursuits other than
self-preservation and reproduction. (Intellectual pleasure, such as humor or learning,
seems not to require ever-increasing stimulus, if only because it requires changing
stimulus.)
● 
If pleasure were one's ultimate value, then one would be agreeable to entering an illusory
paradise. An illusory paradise is an artificial or virtual environment which one believes is real
and which is actively and intelligently optimized for one's happiness. For example, in such a
paradise one would have all (and only) the success and luck that is consistent with one's
need for challenge and achievement. We who value intelligence and life more highly than
pleasure would reject an illusory paradise, unless perhaps it were the only alternative to
irremediable suffering.
Fairness. Fairness is the most obligatory virtue, for two reasons. First, much of fairness
consists in practicing justice, which is itself obligatory. Second, fairness derives directly from
the meta-ethical values of universality and impartiality, as is reflected in the Golden Rule. For
this reason, fairness is like wisdom a maximal virtue: it is impossible to be too wise or too fair.
Kindness. Kindness is the most sublime of the virtues. Kindness includes being in a good
mood and assuming in others the best motive that is consistent with available evidence.
The virtue of kindness makes humans want to help their fellow humans,
especially those in need. A common view is that the best form of
kindness is charity. Charity is the sharing of material wealth with
the needy. But throughout history the greatest improvements in human
well-being have come not from charity but from justice and knowledge.
Humanity's surplus of injustice, superstition, and ignorance is a far
bigger problem than its deficit of charity.
1.3.4. Philosophy / Axiology / Aesthetics
Aesthetics: the study of beauty.
Beauty is the quality of being pleasing to apprehend with the senses or contemplate with the mind.
Origin of Beauty
Beauty can vary in origin:
Natural beauty can derive from
Animate beauty
■ Human beauty is a special case that evolution ensures humans appreciate.
❍ 
❍ Inanimate beauty
❍ Environmental beauty
● 
Artificial beauty can vary by
How it is made:
■ Material beauty
■ Performative beauty
■ Conceptual beauty
❍ 
Why it is made:
■ Accidental beauty
■ Intentional beauty
❍ 
● 
Authenticity is property that obtains when appearance reliably indicates essence, and when the
responsible person (if any) has no intent to dissemble. Many humans consider the authenticity of an
artifact, and the intentions of its creator, to be important aspects of the object's beauty or lack thereof. 
For such humans, beauty consists not merely in sensual appeal.
Since the latter decades of the 1900s there seems to be in Western
culture an inordinate emphasis on authenticity. People don't ask if
the food at a restaurant tastes good; they ask if it is authentic.
Reviewers need to know an author's life story before mustering an
opinion on her novel. Ideas are judged less on their merits than on
the resume of their advocate. This trend seems to reveal that people
are not confident enough in their value judgments, and excessively
afraid of feeling duped in any way. This seems to be a consequence of
the excess relativism that has developed as a reaction to the
collapse in the 1900s of old-fashioned absolutisms and hierarchies
concerning religion, ethnicity, and gender. Deconstructionismand
Critical Theory are two examples of this extreme relativism.
Appeal of Beauty
Beauty can appeal to different faculties:
● Sensual beauty appeals mainly to the senses connected to cognition.
❍ Visual beauty can derive from color, brightness, form, or their contrasts and changes.
❍ Auditory beauty can derive from a wide variety of sonic properties.
Olfactory sensations are sometimes considered by humans to be beautiful, but such
sensations are merely gratifying and are not considered an artistic medium.
❍ 
Sensations of touch, taste, temperature, and equilibrium are even less often considered
beautiful by humans, probably because in humans these senses are less developed and
less connected to cognition. Would persons with highly developed senses
other than sight and hearing ever consider these other sensations to be
beautiful and thus an artistic medium?
❍ 
Affective beauty can be of several different kinds.
Sublimity is the quality of evoking feelings of awe, transcendence, reverence, and
humility.
❍ 
Tragedy is a circumstance evoking fear, sympathy, and regret for the (perhaps inevitable)
misfortune of one or more pitiable persons.
❍ 
Comedy is a circumstance involving
■ a shift in perspective or context that is unexpected but still makes sense, or
■ the foiling of someone's intentions, or
■ ridicule of someone (such as oneself).
❍ 
● 
Intellectual beauty can derive from properties such as
❍ irony or earnestness
❍ simplicity or complexity
❍ harmony or disunity
❍ clarity or ambiguity
❍ completeness or incompleteness
❍ perfection or imperfection
❍ significance or reference (including self-reference)
● 
The presence and nature of perceived beauty in the universe is likely an inevitable result of each
perceiver's evolutionary history. Humans find an oak canopy beautiful and a muddy trench ugly, but an
intelligent mole rat (lacking H. sapiens' arboreal past) would have the opposite opinion. Thus beauty,
like all values, is ultimately subjective, as it depends on the faculties and preferences of the beholder. 
However, beauty can in defined contexts be objective if there is among the beholders enough
commonality of faculty and preference. How different would be the aesthetic
preferences of humans and non-human persons with similar faculties?
2. Mathematics
Mathematics: the study of necessary truths about inference, order, quantity, and relation.
1. Logic: the study of valid inference.
2. Set Theory: the study of sets and the most basic operations on them.
3. Algebra: the study of operations on sets of numbers and symbols representing them.
4. Geometry: the study of transformations of sets of points in space.
5. Analysis: the study of infinite processes as they approach limits.
6. Combinatorics: the study of selection and arrangement within finite sets.
7. Applied Mathematics: the study of the sampling or processing of information.
Mathematical objects exist only in the axioms and rules that imply them and in the minds that
consider them.
Humans have proposed various theories about the nature and basis of mathematics.
Realism holds that mathematics objects are universals that exist independently from any instance
or mind.
● 
● Logicism is the thesis that mathematics can be derived from pure logic.
Intuitionism is the thesis that mathematical objects exist only if they can be constructed by a
definite procedure, and that the law of the excluded middle cannot be assumed, at least in cases
involving infinite sets.
● 
Formalism is the thesis that mathematics can be reduced to a syntactic system that needs only to
be proved self-consistent.
● 
Social Constructivism is the thesis that mathematics and science are human social
constructions.
● 
Realism is wrong because no mathematical objects can exist
independently of the axioms that imply them and the minds that
consider them. Social Constructivism and Intuitionism both
incorrectly hold that mathematical objects cannot exist implicitly in
the axioms that imply them. Formalism fails in its ambition, because
a mathematical formalization cannot be both complete and consistent.
Logicism is the most satisfactory of these theories, because it
recognizes that mathematical objects are implied by the axiomatic
systems underlying them.
Why Math Works
Humans sometimes ask why mathematics works so well in describing the universe. First, the universe
contains a lot of discreteness, invariance, and continuity, all of which are mathematical subjects.
Discreteness: celestial bodies, species, organisms, cells, molecules, atoms, quanta, even spatial
dimensions;
● 
Invariance: conserved quantities like mass-energy, momentum, and electric charge; unchanging
constants like the speed of light and the strengths of the physical forces;
● 
● Continuous regularities, as reflected in the mathematical structure of so many physical laws.
Second, mathematics is defined and designed to be nothing other than the study of the truths that are
the demonstrably necessary consequences of any system of quantity, relation, and inference itself. So it
is unsurprising and natural that mathematics describes the physical universe so well. Note that, like
science, mathematics does not describe the social (i.e. volitional) universe nearly so well, and for the
same reasons.
History of Math
Some of the discoveries or inventions of fundamental mathematical concepts and problems are:
● c500BC Irrational numbers are discovered in Greece.
● c300BC Axiomatization and proof become well-developed in Greece.
● c800 Zero is invented in India as a number for use a base-10 positional number system.
1665 Calculus is invented by Newton (and independently by Leibniz) to understand infinite
processes as they approach limits.
● 
● 1744 Transcendental numbers are shown to exist by Euler.
● 1790s Complex numbers are discovered.
● 1820s Non-euclidean geometry is invented by questioning Euclid's parallel postulate.
● 1879 Mathematical logic is formalized by Frege after earlier work by Boole.
● 1895 Transfinite numbers are discovered by Cantor.
● 1902 Russell discovers the self-referential Russell Paradox in Frege's formalization.
● 1908 Set theory is axiomatized by Zermelo.
● 1931 Godel proves that mathematical formalizations are necessarily incomplete.
2.1. Mathematics / Logic
Logic: the study of valid inference.
1. Formal Logic: the study of systems of valid inference.
2. Metalogic: the study of valid inference about systems of valid inference.
3. Applied Logic: the application of logic to special arenas of inference .
Inference is the process of deriving a new proposition (the conclusion) from a given set of propositions
(the premises). There are two forms of inference:
● Deduction is the process of deriving a conclusion that is necessarily true if its premises are true.
Induction is the process of deriving from particular premises a general conclusion that is 
probably true.
● 
Because induction is uncertain and depends so much on the specific nature of the premises, the topic of
logic focuses almost exclusively on deduction and leaves induction to science.
2.1.1. Mathematics / Logic / Formal Logic
Formal Logic: the study of systems of valid inference.
Propositional Calculus
Propositional Calculus is a system of valid inference about propositions and operations on them.
A proposition is a definite expression about particular terms that is either true or false. Each operator
of Propositional Calculus yields a proposition.
Unary Operators
❍ Negation (not). ¬p is true if and only if p is false.
● 
Symmetrical Binary Operators yield the same truth-value when the operands are transposed:
❍ Conjunction (and). p · q is true if and only if p is true and q is true.
❍ Disjunction (or). p ∨ q is true if and only if ¬(¬p · ¬q)
❍ Nonconjunction (nand). p ⊗ q is true if and only if ¬(p · q)
❍ Nondisjunction (nor). p ⊕ q is true if and only if ¬p · ¬q
❍ Equivalence (xnor). p ≡ q is true if and only if ¬(¬(p · q) · ¬(¬p · ¬q))
❍ Difference (xor). ¬(p ≡ q) is true if and only if ¬(p · q) · ¬(¬p · ¬q)
● 
Asymmetric Binary Operators may not yield the same truth-value when the operands are
transposed:
❍ Implication. p → q is true if and only if ¬(p · ¬q)
● 
All of the operators can be defined using only
● negation and conjunction (as shown above);
● negation and disjunction;
● negation and implication;
● nonconjunction (where ¬p is defined as p ⊗ p); or
● nondisjunction (where ¬p is defined as p ⊕ p).
Axiomatization. An axiomatization of propositional calculus consists of some well-formed formulae
designated as axioms, and transformation rules for deriving valid formulae (called theorems) from
them. One axiomatization of propositional calculus by Russell and Whitehead includes
● Primitives: ¬ ∨ ( ) and propositional variables
Formation rules stating that a well-formed formula (wff) is
❍ any single propositional variable
❍ ¬α, (α), and α ∨ β are wff if α and β are
● 
● Definitions of · → ≡
Axioms
❍ (p ∨ p) → p
❍ q → (p ∨ q)
❍ (p ∨ q) → (q ∨ p)
❍ (q → r) → ((p ∨ q) → (p ∨ r))
● 
Transformation rules:
Substitution: uniformly replacing any variable in a theorem with a wff yields another
theorem
❍ 
❍ Modus Ponens: if α and (α → β) are theorems, then β is a theorem
● 
Theorems. Important theorems of propositional calculus are:
● Equivalence of identity: p ≡ p
● Double negation: p ≡ ¬¬p
● Excluded middle: p ∨ ¬p
● Noncontradiction: ¬(p · ¬p)
Predicate Calculus
Predicate Calculus is a system of valid inference about propositions, their constituent terms,
predicates and quantifiers, and operations on them. A term is a reference to that which can be
considered as separate and distinct or counted as one, such as a person, place, instant, action, idea, or
proposition. A predicate is an expression of one or more terms drawn from one or more sets denoting
the membership of their permutation in a subset of the cross-product of those sets and connoting that
permutation's enjoyment of the attribute associated with that subset. A property is any one-term
predicate such as Red(). A relation is any multiple-term predicate such as Loves(,). A variable is a
symbol that stands for a term or predicate. A quantifier is an expression that, for a variable term in a
specified proposition, tells how many definite terms (e.g. all, some) it applies to.
● Universal Quantifier: ∀x means "for all x".
● Existential Quantifier: ∃x means "for at least one x".
Each of the two quantifiers may be defined in terms of the other. First-Order Predicate Calculus is
the subset of Predicate Calculus in which no predicate variable is quantified. The First-Order Predicate
Calculus is not decidable, but becomes so if predicate variables are restricted to being unary.
A binary relation R over a a set's cross-product with itself may enjoy various attributes:
● Reflexive: (∀x) R(x,x) e.g. "is identical to"
● Irreflexive: (∀x) ¬R(x,x) e.g. "is younger than"
● Quasi-reflexive: (∀x)((∃y)R(x,y) → R(x,x)) e.g. "has same hair color as" (vs. bald)
● Nonreflexive: ((∃x)R(x,x)) · ((∃x)¬R(x,x)) e.g. "is proud of"
● Symmetric: (∀x)(∀y)(R(x,y) → R(y,x)) e.g. "is related to"
● Asymmetric: (∀x)(∀y)(R(x,y) → ¬R(y,x)) e.g. "is the child of"
Nonsymmetric: ((∃x)(∃y)(R(x,y) · R(y,x))) · ((∃x)(∃y)(R(x,y) · ¬R(y,x))) e.g. "likes being related
to"
● 
● Transitive: (∀x)(∀y)(∀z)((R(x,y) · R(y,z)) → R(x,z)) e.g. "is ancestor of"
● Inransitive: (∀x)(∀y)(∀z)((R(x,y) · R(y,z)) → ¬R(x,z)) e.g. "is mother of"
Nontransitive: ((∃x)(∃y)(∃z)((R(x,y) · R(y,z) · R(x,z))) · ((∃x)(∃y)(∃z)((R(x,y) · R(y,z) ·
¬R(x,z))) e.g. "is stepsibling of"
● 
● Equivalence: any relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, e.g. "is related to"
Identity. First-Order Predicate Calculus can be extended with the two-term predicate identity (=). This
predicate allows quantification to express precise numerical bounds, by saying that two variables must
or must not identify the same instance. A proposition can contain what appears to be a term but that
refers to no existing thing, such as "the present king of France". Such a phrase is not a term but a
definite description. A definite description is an expression that appears to simply refer to some thing
but instead actually makes a claim that the uniquely described thing exists.
Is. There are at least four logical meanings of 'is':
Existence: "Earth is" or "(∃x)(x = Earth)". Hence Quine's dictum that to be is to be the value of a
bound variable.
● 
● Identity: "Earth is our planet" or "Earth = our planet"
● Predication: "Earth is a planet" or "Planet(Earth)"
● Implication: "A planet is a world" or "(∀x)(Planet(x) → World(x))"
Second-Order Predicate Calculus is the subset of Predicate Calculus in which both term variables
and predicate variables may be quantified. Second-Order Predicate Calculus can use Leibniz's Principle
of the Identity of Indiscernibles to define x = y as (∀ϕ)(ϕx≡ϕy): "for all possible predicates, the
predicate applies to x as it applies to y".
Modal Logic
Modal Logic is a system of propositional logic that adds operators concerning necessity and
possibility. Modal Logic adds to Propositional Calculus the following:
modal operators
❍ Necessity: Lα is true if and only if it is necessary that α is true.
❍ Possibility: Mα is true if and only if ~L~a (it is not necessary that α is not false).
● 
axioms
❍ Lp → p
❍ L(p → q) → (Lp → Lq)
● 
transformation rule
❍ If α is a theorem, so is Lα (i.e. theorems are necessarily true).
● 
Stronger systems of modal logic (named S4, S5, and Brouwerian) can be obtained by adding axioms
that the modality of a proposition is itself a necessary modal truth. S4 results by adding the axiom Lp
→ LLp. S5 results by adding Mp → LMp. The Brouwerian system results by adding p → LMp. These
modal propositional calculi are decidable, but modal first-order predicate calculi are not.
Other Logics
Many-Valued Logic. Some philosophers assert that propositions about future or non-existent things
can be neither true nor false. For example, "there will be a sea battle tomorrow", or "the present king of
France is bald". Propositional calculi can be defined in which there is a third truth-value (e.g. neuter,
half-true) or even infinitely many gradations of truth-value. In such a propositional calculus the laws of
noncontradiction and the excluded middle do not hold. Fuzzy Logic is a sort of many-valued logic in
which truth or set membership is expressed as a probability rather than as all-or-nothing.
Intuitionist Logic. Intuitionism rejects the validity of the laws of the excluded middle and of
double-negation, and thus any reductio ad absurdam argument. Intuitionism rejects the use of truth
tables for testing the validity of propositions, because truth tables assume one can exclude "middle"
possibilities of neither truth nor falsity.
2.1.2. Mathematics / Logic / Metalogic
Metalogic: the study of valid inference about systems of valid inference.
The decidability of a system of logic is the property of having an effective or mechanical procedure
for deciding the truth value of any well-formed formula of the system.
A system is consistent if ¬α is not a theorem whenever α is a theorem. A system is weakly complete
if every valid wff is a theorem. A system is strongly complete if the addition as an axiom of any wff
not already a theorem would make the system inconsistent. An axiom or transformation rule of a
system is independent if it cannot be derived from the remainder of the system's axiomatization. The
propositional calculus is decidable, consistent and strongly complete, and each of its axioms and
transformation rules are independent. The first-order predicate calculus is undecidable, consistent and
at least weakly complete.
Godel's 1st Incompleteness Theorem states that all consistent systems of number theory include
undecidable propositions. Godel's 2nd Incompleteness Theorem states that no consistent system of
number theory can prove its own consistency.

Applied Logic: the application of logic to special arenas of inference .
Fallacies
A fallacy is any potentially persuasive argument that is not a valid method of inference.
Material fallacies are fallacies that misuse facts.
The fallacy of accident is applying a general truth to a particular proposition which
violates the general truth's tacit qualifications. The converse fallacy of accident is
improper generalization from anecdotal evidence.
❍ 
The fallacy of false cause is assuming that temporal coincidence or succession
demonstrates a causal relationship.

Paradoxes
A paradox is a statement or conclusion that seems false or contradictory but actually might be true.
A sorites paradox reaches an absurd conclusion by repeatedly applying to a reasonable base
case a seemingly reasonable absolute rule that is in fact slightly unreasonable. Example: if (a) 1
is a small number and (b) 1 plus any small number is another small number, then all numbers are
● 
small. In fact, the second premise is not strictly true. Variants of this paradox involve predicates
like poor, bald, and not-a-heap.
Lottery paradox: if (a) it is reasonable to believe that any given lottery ticket is not a
winner and (b) the lottery can only be won by a winning ticket, then it is reasonable to
believe that the lottery will not be won. Here, (a) is not strictly true. It is not reasonable to
believe that any given lottery ticket is not -- i.e. cannot be -- a winner. Any weaker belief
is consistent with the lottery having a winning ticket.
❍ 
Paradox of identity (or of Theseus' ship): if replacing one component of a composite
entity does not change its identity, then the entity can share identity with a later composite
having no common components, and can not share identity with a later composite
consisting entirely of its original components. This is not a true sorites paradox, because
the conclusion only seems absurd to those who do not fully understand identity.
❍ 
A self-reference paradox creates indeterminacy or contradiction through self-reference.
The liar paradox (or Eubulides Paradox) is "this statement is false". (Epimenides'
paradox is the statement by Epimenides that all Cretans are liars because one has said so,
and is not really a paradox because the existence of one honest Cretan makes it just a
falsehood.) Godel's Incompleteness Theorems rest on a mathematization of the liar
paradox.
❍ 
Russell's paradox, discovered in May 1901 by Bertrand Russell, points out that the set of
all sets that are not members of themselves is a member of itself if and only if it is not a
member of itself. Since mathematics is based on set theory, any mathematical proof is
suspect if set theory allows this contradiction. Modern set theory avoids the paradox by
restricting the kinds of predicates (like not-members-of-themselves) that can be used to
define sets. Variants of this paradox include the Barber Paradox and the Catalog Paradox.
❍ 
Grelling's paradox is that the adjective 'heterological', meaning 'not self-applicable', is
itself heterological if and only if it is not heterological.
❍ 
The Berry Paradox refers to "the smallest number not describable in less than eleven
words", and thus purports to describe that number in less than eleven words.
❍ 
The omniscience paradox attempts to show omniscience (knowing every true sentence) is
impossible because "no being knows this sentence is true" is a true sentence that no

❍ 
The unexpected event (hanging, exam) is one that will happen to a person in in the next
N days on a day that person doesn't expect, and seems paradoxical because the person can
seemingly prove that the event cannot be on the last day or (by iterative reasoning) any
previous day. But proving the event cannot happen then allows it to be unexpected, and
thus this paradox is equivalent to the statement "you cannot prove this statement is true".

Paradoxes of Game Theory
Newcomb's Paradox, invented by William Newcomb, is the choice of one or both of two
prizes, the first of which is of a modest known value, and the second of which is worth
either nothing or a fortune, depending on whether a heretofore infallible seer predicted
both prizes would be chosen. The right choice depends simply on whether one believes
one's choice can influence or be foreseen by the seer's earlier prediction. The former belief
implies a causal loop, and the latter implies some form of determinism, both of which are
counterintuitive and thus clash with the seer's empirical infallibility.
❍ 
The St. Petersburg paradox, invented by Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), is that there is
infinite expected value from a game with infinitely many possible consequences where the
reward from each consequence is the reciprocal of its probability. This absurd result rests
on the false premises that unlimited wealth is available to fund rewards and that unlimited
value or utility is even possible.
❍ 
The Two-Envelope Paradox asserts that, for two envelopes with a 2:1 ratio of money
hidden inside them, the expected value of picking the other envelope is always 25%
higher. This paradox disappears if there is any finite maximum value for how much an
envelope might contain.
❍ 
The Prisoner's Dilemma, formulated by Albert Tucker, is a non-zero-sum two-player
game in which both players would do better if they both cooperated rather than not, but
each can always improve his outcome by not cooperating, and so rational self-interest
leads to a suboptimal outcome. This counter-intuitive suboptimality is eliminated if the
players believe they will be engaging in repeated interactions in which they can recognize
each other and remember each other's past behavior.

Paradoxes of Inductive Prediction
Hempel's Paradox, discovered by Carl Hempel in 1965, is that if a statement ("all ravens
are black") tends to be confirmed inductively by observations ("yet another black raven"),
then it should also tend to be confirmed by observations ("yet another non-black
non-raven") that confirm its (logically equivalent) contrapositive ("all non-black things are
non-ravens"). "Yet another non-black non-raven" does indeed tend infinitessimally to
confirm "all ravens are black" -- or, more precisely, the infinite disjunction "(all ravens are
black) or (all ravens are white) or ..".
❍ 
Grue, described by Nelson Goodman (1906-1998), is the color predicated of anything
appearing green when first observed before a future time T, or blue when first observed
after time T. Goodman's Paradox is that all observations supporting "emeralds are green"
also support "emeralds are grue". Goodman's Paradox is resolved by noting that "emeralds
are green" represents a more parsimonious explanatory scheme than does "emeralds are
grue".

Mereology
Mereology is the study of part-whole relationships. Mereology helps to resolve Russell's Paradox
concerning the set of all sets not containing themselves. It does so by disambiguating the distributive
and collective interpretations of "e is an element of the set of M's". The distributive (i.e. predicative)
interpretation is "e is an M", while the collective interpretation is "e is a part of the whole consisting of
all the M's".
The fundamental definitions of mereology are:
Inclusion (I) is the fundamental relation of mereology and is not formally defined, but it is to be
understood that (a I b) if and only if b is a part of a or is the same object as a.
● 
● Disjointness (|): a | b is true if and only if ¬(∃x)((a I x) · (b I x)).
● Comprising (∑): S ∑b is true for a set S if and only if (∀x)( x|b≡ (∀y)(y∈S→y|x)).
The fundamental axioms of mereology are:
Things that are part of each other are identical:
❍ (∀x)(∀y)((xIy · yIx) → (x=y))
● 
A thing is part of a whole only if everything that is disjoint from the whole is disjoint from the
part:
❍ (∀x)(∀y)(xIy ≡ (∀z)(z|x → z|y))
● 
Every non-empty set comprises some sum:
❍ (∃x)(x∈S) → (∃y)(S ∑ y)

2.2. Mathematics / Set Theory
Set Theory: the study of sets and the most basic operations on them.
A set is a formally undefined notion in set theory that can intuitively be understood as a collection of
terms. Membership (∈) is a formally undefined relation in set theory that can intuitively be understood
as "being an element of", and is such that a given object either is or isn't a member of a given set.
Axiomatization.
Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory is the standard axiomatization of set theory, and when combined with
the axiom of choice is designated ZFC. The axioms of ZFC are:
● Extension. Two sets are identical if and only if they have the same members.
● Empty set. There exists a set with no members: the empty set.
Separation. For any set S and condition C, there exists a set S' containing all and only the
members of S satisfying C provided that C does not quantify over S'.
● 
● Pairing. For any two sets, there exists a set having those two sets as its only members.
● Power Set. For any set S, there exists a set P whose members are all and only the subsets of S.
Union. For any set S, there exists a set U whose members are all and only the members of the
sets that are members of S.
● 
Infinity. There exists a set S having the empty set as a member and, if x is a member of S, then
so is {x, {x}}.
● 
Well-Ordering. For every set there exists a total order such that every non-empty subset of S
has a least member under that order.
● 
The axiom of choice states that for any set S of non-empty sets, there exists a function F defined on S
such that for each member X of S, F(X) is (i.e. chooses) a member of X. The axiom of choice is
equivalent to the well-ordering axiom, in that each can be used with ZF to prove the other.

The universe consists ultimately of nothing but elementary particles interacting in space-time via
fundamental forces.
Elementary Particles
An elementary particle is a quantum of matter or energy that has no known structure or spatial extent
and that is subject to one or more of the fundamental forces according to its fundamental properties.
Elementary particles can be divided into three generations of increasing relative mass. An antiparticle
of a particle is one identical to it (e.g. in mass) except for having negated values of quantized properties
like electric charge (and thus magnetic moment). Every charged elementary particle has an antiparticle.
Antimatter is matter composed of the antiparticles of the particles in ordinary matter.
Quarks are fermions that are always bound into hadrons (such as protons and neutrons) and that
possess mass, electric charge of 1/3 or -2/3, angular momentum of 1/2, baryon number of 1/3,
strong color, and strong flavor.
● 
Leptons are fermions such as electrons and neutrinos that possess mass, electric charge of -1, 0,
or 1, angular momentum of 1/2, and lepton number of 1 or -1.
Electrons are nearly massless stable leptons that carry the smallest independent unit of
negative electric charge and that form the shell that gives ordinary atoms their spatial and
electrochemical properties. Positrons are the positively-charged antiparticles of electrons.
❍ 
Muons are leptons similar to electrons and positrons except that they are about 207 times
more massive and are subject to decay via the weak force.
❍ 
❍ Taus are leptons similar to muons except they are even more massive and more unstable.
Neutrinos are stable leptons with no electric charge and little or no mass that are
generated by nuclear reactions and that can penetrate ordinary matter indefinitely because
they feel only gravity and the weak force. There are three generations of neutrinos,
corresponding respectively to electrons, muons, and taus.
❍ 
● 
Gauge bosons are bosons that mediate the fundamental forces. Bosons with odd spin mediate
vector fields like electromagnetism that can be either attractive or repulsive. Bosons with even
spin mediate vector fields like gravity that are only attractive. Bosons with no spin mediate
scalar fields like the hypothetical Higgs field.
Photons are uncharged massless spin=1 quanta of electromagnetic radiation (such as
visible light) that always move at light speed and with a characteristic frequency that
determines their color.
❍ 
❍ Gluons are uncharged spin=1 strongly-colored carriers of the strong nuclear force.
❍ W-bosons are relatively massive charged spin=1 carriers of the weak nuclear force.
❍ Z-bosons are relatively massive uncharged spin=1 carriers of the weak nuclear force.
❍ Gravitons are hypothetical uncharged massless spin=±2 carriers of gravity.
Higgs bosons are hypothetical uncharged massless spin=0 bosons that mediate the
hypothetical scalar field that gives particles their mass.
❍ 
● 
Theories beyond the Standard Model predict various new particles such as leptoquark bosons, sleptons,
sneutrinos, squarks, selectrons, photinos, gluinos, charginos, neutralinos, axions, and magnetic
monopoles.
Fundamental Properties
A fundamental property is a way that one elementary particle can differ from another. All other
material properties, such as color, temperature, texture, and wetness are composite properties that do
not apply to elementary particles.
● Position is location in space-time.
● Rest mass is the mass a particle would have if not in motion.
● Frequency
● Linear momentum
A quantized property is one that can only occur in discrete amounts that are either integral or an
integral fraction of 2 or 3. The remaining fundamental properties are quantized.
Angular momentum or spin of fundamental particles is quantized as multiples of Planck's
Constant divided by 2π.
● 
Electric charge is the quantized property that causes matter to be attracted or repelled by
electrons.
● 
● Strong color is the property of quarks that binds them together.
Other quantized properties serve only as "quantum numbers" that distinguish different particles and
govern their conservation and combination.
Strong isotopic spin is the property of nucleons that distinguishes protons (with spin 1/2) from
neutrons (with spin -1/2) and that is conserved in strong force interactions.
● 
Weak isotopic spin is the property that distinguishes up and down quarks, or electrons and
electron-neutrinos.
● 
● Strong flavor is the property that distinguishes the six different types of quarks.
● Baryon number is a property of quarks that governs how they may combine into hadrons.
● Lepton number is the property of leptons that governs how they are conserved.
Fundamental Forces
All interactions involving matter or energy are due to some combination of fundamental forces.
A fundamental force is a force that is not known to be reducible to other forces. Humans know three
fundamental forces.
Gravity is the curvature of four-dimensional space-time that causes all masses to attract each
other and that is caused by the presence of mass itself. Gravity is the weakest of the fundamental
forces but has the most noticeable long-range effects. Gravity holds galaxies, star systems, stars,
and planets together. Gravity causes the pressure that ignites stars like the Sun. Gravity causes
objects to fall toward Earth instead of drifting away into space.
● 
The Electroweak Force is the unified force that manifests itself as electromagnetism and the
weak nuclear force.
Electromagnetism is the force that is caused by electric charge, that radiates at the speed
of light for all observers, and that manifests itself as electric and magnetic forces.
Electromagnetism causes the familiar forms of radiation such as visible light, infrared
radiation (radiated heat), microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays. Electromagnetism causes
materials to absorb, emit, or reflect radiation instead of being transparent to it.
Electricity is the aspect of electromagnetism that consists of attractive and
repulsive Coulomb forces between electric charges that occur as discrete quanta
carried by elementary particles. Electricity is far stronger than gravity, but rarely
acts over visible distances because positive and negative electrical charge is evenly
distributed in the macroscopic world. Electrical repulsion between the electrons in
atoms causes short-range contact forces between them and prevents objects from
passing through each other. Electrical attraction between an atom's nucleus and the
■ 
❍ 
● 
outer electrons of neighboring atoms is responsible for all chemical properties and
reactions.
Magnetism is the aspect of electromagnetism that consists of attractive and
repulsive forces between electric charges that are rotating or otherwise moving in a
loop. Magnetism causes magnets to attract certain metals and to attract and repel
each other. Magnets are used in compasses and many other devices.
■ 
The Weak Nuclear Force is the short-range force that acts on all fermions and is
responsible for the radioactive decay of many kinds of subatomic particles. The weak
nuclear force causes the radioactivity that heats the Earth's core and results in geothermal
phenomena like volcanism.
❍ 
The Strong Nuclear Force is the immensely powerful short-range force that causes attraction
both among the quarks within hadrons and among the quarks in adjacent hadrons. The strong
force overcomes the electrostatic repulsion among protons and binds them together with
neutrons in atomic nuclei. Since the strong force is only about 100 times stronger than
electromagnetism, nuclei become unstable as they approach having 100 protons. Strong
attraction causes the fusion of nuclei lighter than iron that powers thermonuclear explosives and
stars like the Sun.
● 
Unification. Human physicists strongly suspect that all three of these forces are merely different
manifestations of a single underlying unified force, just as the electric and magnetic forces are different
manifestations of the electromagnetic force. How can the fundamental forces be unified
into a theory of a single underlying unified force? This is one of the most important
unanswered questions in physics.
Conserved Quantities
Conservation is an invariance that holds over time in a system that is closed or isolated in some
specified way. Noether's Theorem states that every conservation law is associated with some
symmetry or homogeneity.
Energy-Momentum
The "stress-energy tensor" of general relativity is invariant due to the homogeneity of
space-time.
❍ Energy is conserved due to the homogeneity of time.
Momentum is conserved due to the homogeneity of space.
■ Linear Momentum is conserved due to invariance under displacement.
■ Angular Momentum is conserved due to invariance under rotation.
❍ 
● 
Charge-Parity-Time is conserved, so that if a given process is possible, then so is a process with
reversed charge, reversed parity (handedness), and reversed temporal direction.
● 
Electric Charge is conserved due to "gauge invariance under an arbitrary phase transformation
on a particle wave function".
● 
Baryon-Lepton Number. Baryon and lepton number are each conserved under most interactions,
but both are predicted not to be conserved in proton decay. However, the difference of baryon
number minus lepton number is predicted to be conserved.
● 
Conservation of baryon-lepton number is predicted to be violated by black holes as they absorb
baryons and leptons and evaporate into photons.
Fundamental Constants
Fundamental constants are those in any minimal set of constants each of whose value could not in
principle be calculated from the others and the initial conditions of the universe. Fundamental constants
include dimension-measuring constants and dimensionless constants.
Dimension-measuring constants are those fundamental constants that help define natural units of
measure that are independent of any particular system of measures. These constants define natural
units of duration, distance, mass, and electric charge.
Speed of Light (c = exactly 299792458 m/s for all observers) in a vacuum relates space to time
in the space-time described by relativity. The speed of light defines the rate at which information
and influence can travel.
● 
Planck's Constant (h = 6.62606876 × 10-34 joules⋅sec) relates the energy of a photon to its
frequency and defines the granularity of action in quantum theory. Planck's Constant defines the
scale at which the universe is quantized. A related constant is h = h/2π.
● 
Gravitational Constant (G = 6.673 × 10-19 m3/kg⋅s) relates mass to acceleration and thus
defines the strength of gravity.
● 
Electron Charge (e = 1.602176462 × 10-19 ● Coulomb) is the natural unit of electric charge.
Dimensionless constants are ratios between quantities of the same dimension that thus have the same
value in every system of measures. Humans know of 18 to 22 fundamental dimensionless constants.
The Strong Coupling Constant (αs = gs
2/hc ≈ 1) defines the strength of the strong nuclear
force.
● 
The Electroweak Coupling Constant (GF) defines the strength of the electroweak force. From
it are derived two related dimensionless constants:
Electromagnetic Coupling Constant or Fine Structure Constant (αe = e2/hc ≈ 1/137)
defines the strength of electromagnetism.
❍ 
Weak Coupling Constant (αw= gFm2c/h3≈10-5) defines the strength of the weak nuclear
force, where gF is the Fermi Coupling Constant (gF = GF/(hc)3 = 1.16637 x 10-5 GeV-2)

Why did the Big Bang happen? How can we explain the existence and values of the free variables?
Why are there precisely three spatial dimensions? Does the information destroyed in black holes
constitute an arrow of time? Is time travel physically possible, perhaps only if paradoxes are censored?
How can Quantum Theory and Relativity be reconciled? Is Quantum Theory correct in requiring either
anti-relativistic faster-than-light influence or time-reversed causality? How do black holes destroy
information (other than that of mass, charge, angular momentum, and temperature) that Quantum
Theory says must be preserved?
How does sound cause in liquids the generation of small but intense bursts of light and heat known as
sonoluminescence? What causes high-temperature superconductivity?

Fundamental Concepts
Mechanics has three fundamental concepts:
Time is the ordering of eventsaccording to the potential of some events to causally influence
other events.
● 
Space is the seemingly boundless and continuous three-dimensional extent in which all matter is
located and all events occur.
● 
● Inertia is resistance to change in velocity.
Each concept has an associated quantity:
● Duration (t) is a measure of the separation between two instants in time.
● Distance (d) is a measure of the separation between two points in space.
● Mass (m) is a measure of inertia.
Each quantity has a standard unit of measure:
A second is the duration required for 9,192,631,770 wave periods of a particular emission of
cesium-133. Before 1967, a second was defined as a fraction of the length of the year 1900 as
measured by stellar motion. Before 1956, a second was defined as 1/(24*60*60) of the mean
solar day.
● 
A meter is the distance light travels through a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 sec. Earlier, a meter
was defined as the distance between two marks on a platinum-iridium bar kept in Sèvres, France,
near Paris. Originally, a meter had been defined as 1/40,000,000 of the earth's polar diameter.
● 
A kilogram is the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram, a platinum-iridium cylinder
kept at Sèvres, France, near Paris. Originally, the kilogram had been defined as the mass of
1000 cubic centimeters of pure water.
● 
Each quantity also has anatural unit of measure that can be expressed in terms of the fundamental
constants c, G, and h:
The Planck duration is (hG/c52π)1/2 or 5.39 x 10¯44 ● sec.
The Planck distance is (hG/c32π)1/2 or 1.616 x 10¯35 ● m.
The Planck mass is (hc/G2π)1/2 or 2.1767 x 10¯8 ● kg.
Derived Concepts
Matter is that which has mass and occupies space. A body is any individual coherent material thing.
Deformation is a change in the distances among the points of mass comprising a body. Rigidity is the
tendency of a body not to deform. Elasticity is the tendency of a body to recover from deformation.
The states of matter are:
● A solid is a body that does not deform under force and thus has a definite volume and shape.
A fluid is a body that deforms under force.
A liquid is a relatively incompressible fluid that does not expand indefinitely and thus has
a free surface.
❍ 
❍ [[gas]]
● 
A plasma is an ionized gas with roughly equal numbers of positive and negative ions, making it
electrically conductive and sensitive to magnetic fields. Fluorescent light bulbs create plasmas
when turned on.
● 
An Einstein-Bose Condensate is the state of matter cooled so close to absolute zero that its
atoms have almost no momentum, which due to the quantum Uncertainty Principle means that
their positions are increasingly indeterminate and overlap each other. Superfluidity is when
super-cooled helium flows without friction or dissipation, and is believed to be due to
Einstein-Bose Condensation.
● 
3.1.1.1. Natural Science / Physics / Mechanics / Rigid Mechanics
Rigid Mechanics: the study of the motion of rigid bodies.
Derived Concepts of Translational Motion
Translational motion is motion from point to point in space. The following concepts of translational
motion can be derived from the fundamental concepts of mechanics:
● Force (F) is the scalar ability to change momentum.
● Position (x,y,z) is the vector in space from the cartesian origin.
● Displacement (s) is the vector difference in space between two positions.
● Velocity (v = s/t) is the vector time-rate of displacement.
● Acceleration (a = v/t) is the vector time-rate of velocity.
● Momentum (p = mv) is the vector measure of the motion of a mass.
Work (W = Fs cos ß, where ß is the angle between F and s) is force applied through a
displacement.
● 
Energy (E = W) is the ability to do work. E = Fs = mas = 1/2 mv2 [because Calculus shows that
2as = v2]
● 
● Power (P) is the time-rate of work. P = E/t
Action (A = Et) is energy E applied through some duration t and thus measures the magnitude
of an event.
● 
Momentum is proportional to velocity, while energy is proportional to acceleration and thus to the
square of velocity.
Derived Concepts of Angular Motion
Angular motion is motion about an axis. The derived concepts of translational motion all have analogs
for angular motion, which is considered in polar coordinates with a fixed radius r.
Moment Of Inertia (I; analogous to mass) is a measure of resistance to change in angular
velocity. I = mr2
● 
Torque (L; analogous to force), or moment of force, is the ability of an oblique force to change
angular momentum. L= Iα = Fr sin ß [ß: angle between F and r] Note that both Work and
Torque are the product of force and distance, but Torque deals with the component of force
perpendicular -- rather than parallel -- to the distance.

● Angular Position is the angle from the polar origin.
● Angular Displacement (φ) is the vector difference between two angular positions.
● Angular Velocity (ω) is the time-rate of angular displacement. ω = φ/t
● Angular Acceleration (α) is the time-rate of angular velocity. α = ω/t
Angular Momentum (A) is a vector measure of the angular motion of a mass about an axis. A =
Iω
● 
Work (W) in angular motion is Torque applied through an angular displacement, W = Lφ, and is again
equivalent to energy.
Centripetal Force is any force on a body toward the axis of its angular motion. Centrifugal Force is
the inertia-induced apparent force on a body away from the axis of its angular motion. A bucket spun
around an axis by a rope connecting it to that axis experiences centripetal force from the rope. Water
in the bucket is held in place by an opposing centrifugal force which is actually just the inertia of the
water trying to keep the water going in a straight (tangent) line.
Principles
The principle of least action: motion between two points takes the path of minimum action. From this
principle can be derived Newton's laws of motion.
Newton's Laws of motion.
1. A body changes velocity only if a force acts on it.
2. Force accelerates a body in proportion to the ratio of the force to the body's mass: F = ma.
To every force there is an equal and opposite reaction force. This implies that momentum is
conserved in isolated systems.
3. 
Newton's Law of Gravity: the gravitational force between two masses is proportional to the product
of their masses and to the inverse square of the distance between them.
Machines. Because W = Fs (work = force × displacement) and work (energy) is conserved, the same
work can be done by decreasing the force and increasing the displacement. A machine so magnifies
the effect of a decreased force by applying it through an increased distance, resulting in a mechanical
advantage. The simple machines:
The lever and fulcrum multiplies force according to the ratio of the lengths of the lever arms.
The wheel and axle and the crank are simply radial levers, with the axle serving as the fulcrum.
● 
The inclined plane multiplies force according to the ratio of length of the plane and the height
traversed. The screw is simply a radially inclined plan. The wedge is a pair of inclined planes.
● 
The pulley multiplies force by the number of free (i.e. length-changing) cords running to the
moveable (i.e. force-multiplying) pulley(s).
● 
The hydraulic press multiplies force according to the ratio of the areas of the input and output
surfaces, as dictated by Pascal's Law.
● 
3.1.1.2. Natural Science / Physics / Mechanics / Non-Rigid Mechanics
Non-Rigid Mechanics: the study of the motion of non-rigid (elastic and fluid) bodies.
Concepts
The basic concepts of non-rigid mechanics:
Stress is the internal force exerted by one part of an elastic body upon the adjoining part. There
are four kinds of stress:
❍ Tension is stress produced by a pull.
❍ Compression is stress produced by a push.
❍ Shear is stress produced by a force acting tangent to a surface.
❍ Torsion is stress produced by a force acting to twist the body about an axis.
● 
Strain is the deformation caused by stress. Elastic Limitis the maximum stress a material can
sustain such that the strain disappears when the stress is removed.
● 
● Density (d = m/V) is mass m per unit volume V.
● Pressure (p = F/A ) is perpendicular force F per unit area A.
Buoyancy is a reverse (upward) force that an accelerated (weighted) fluid exerts on a body
immersed in that fluid.
● 
● Elastic wave motion is propagation of deformations through a deformable medium.
Harmonic motion is regular oscillation in which the acceleration of the oscillating object is
directly proportional to the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position but
oppositely directed.
● 
Cohesion is the attractive force between adjacent parts of a solid or liquid that holds it together
and that is caused by electrical forces between molecules.
● 
● Adhesion is the attractive force between adjacent parts of two different solids or liquids.
Principles

The basic principles of non-rigid mechanics:
[[Hooke's Law]]

● 
Depth Pressure. For a fluid of uniform density d under (e.g. gravitational) acceleration (g),
pressure p adds to surface pressure p0 in proportion to depth h: p = hdg + p0
● 
Pascal's Law states that increases in pressure are transmitted equally throughout a fluid. Since p
= F/A, a small force F applied to a small area A can create a larger force but on a larger area.
Because the fluid volume is fixed (and because work/energy is conserved), the larger force is
applied through a shorter distance than the smaller force. The hydraulic press uses Pascal's Law
to multiply force.
● 
Archimedes' Principle. The buoyant force F on an immersed body is equal in magnitude but
opposite in direction to the force of gravity g acting on the mass m of the upwardly displaced
fluid: F = -gm = -gdV. This can be understood by considering a cylinder of the fluid extending
from the fluid's surface down to some depth. Equilibrium demands that the weight of the
cylinder of fluid is balanced by an upward force exerted by fluid pressure on the bottom of the
cylinder. This upward force causes buoyancy.
● 
● Boyle's Gas Law. For a fixed amount of gas at a fixed temperature, pressure is inversely
proportional to volume.
Fourier's Theorem. When two waves travel through a point, the displacement at that point is
the vector sum of the displacements produced by the two waves. Any complex harmonic wave
can be considered the sum of some number of simple harmonic waves.
● 
Refraction, reflection. The speed of a wave increases with elasticity and decreases with density.
When a wave meets a boundary between media of different elasticity or density, part of the wave
is reflected back into the original medium, and part is transmitted with a different velocity, thus
changing the wave's direction of travel if it were not perpendicular to the boundary.
● 
Law of Refraction. The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of
refraction is equal to the ratio of the wave speeds before and after the boundary.
● 
Doppler's Principle. Relative motion between a wave source and an observer causes a change
in the frequency perceived by the observer.
● 
3.1.1.3. Natural Science/ Physics / Mechanics / Relativity
Relativity: the study of gravity and frames of reference.
Special Relativity is the physics of inertial frames. An inertial frame is a frame of reference under
uniform motion. Special Relativity postulates:
The speed of light is a finite constant for any observer in an inertial reference frame, regardless
of the relative motion of the light source.
● 
● The laws of physics apply the same way in all inertial frames.
The implications of Special Relativity include the following.
● Matter and information cannot propagate faster than the speed of light.
In a reference frame in motion with respect to the observer, length in that frame contracts in the
direction of motion, and time in that frame slows as the motion increases. (So as a train goes by,
its cars seem somewhat shorter than when at rest, and its clock runs slower.)
● 
Events that appear simultaneous to an observer in one reference frame may not appear
simultaneous to an observer in another, because the light from the events may reach the
observers in different orders. Neither duration nor distance between two separate events can be
measured absolutely (i.e. agreed on by observers in all inertial frames), but all observers can
agree on the combined spatiotemporal interval between the two events.
● 
● Space and time are aspects of four-dimensional space-time.
Mass and energy are equivalent and interchangeable, as E = mc2 ● .
Everything moves at the speed of light through space-time. The faster an object moves through
space, the slower it moves through time, as measured by a clock that is stationary in the spatial
reference frame through which the object moves.
● 
General Relativity is the physics of frames of reference under acceleration. It has two postulates:
● Relativity is the principle that local physics is governed by the special theory of relativity.
● Equivalence is the principle that gravity and acceleration are locally indistinguishable.
The implications of General Relativity are:
● Gravitational and inertial mass are equivalent.
Mass-energy curves space-time and thus bends the path of light rays. Spacetime is the seemingly
boundless and continuous four-dimensional extent, consisting of three space-like dimensions and
● 
one time-like dimension, in which all matter is located and all events occur, and whose curvature
is caused by mass-energy and in turn causes gravity.
Time passes more slowly in stronger gravitational fields, and light leaving those fields is
increased in wavelength.
● 
● The universe is expanding.
Gravity propagates at the speed of light, and not instantaneously as assumed in Newtonian
mechanics. Gravitational waves are disturbances in space-time that result whenever a mass
changes velocity. Gravitational waves are what account for the energy and angular momentum
observed to be lost from some binary pulsars as they orbit each other.
● 
The perihelion of an orbit like Mercury's should advance even more than is predicted by
Newtonian mechanics as a result of influence from the other planets.
● 
Mysteries
Mach's Principle is that the there is no absolute space and that the structure of space-time depends
only on the distribution of matter. Is Mach's Principle true?
3.1.2. Natural Science / Physics / Wave Physics
Wave Physics: the study of the motion of disturbances.
3.1.3. Natural Science / Physics / Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics: the study of heat and its relationship to energy.
Heat
Heat is the total kinetic energy of the random molecular motion of a body. Temperature (T) is the
average kinetic energy of the random molecular motion of a body. Specific heat of a substance is the
amount of heat per unit mass required to raise its temperature a fixed amount. Thermal Equilibrium is
the relation shared by two bodies in contact when heat no longer flows between them.
Latent heat is the heat a substance must lose, without changing temperature, in order to change phase
from gas to liquid or liquid to solid. Vaporization is the change from liquid to gas due to addition of
heat but without necessarily changing temperature. Freezing is the change from liquid to solid due to
removal of heat but without necessarily changing temperature. Evaporation is the change from liquid
to gas due to the escape of the liquid's more energetic molecules through its surface shared with an
unsaturated gas.
Heat Transfer. There are three mechanisms of heat transfer:
● Thermodynamic Conduction is heat transfer due to contact.
● Convection is heat transfer due to movement of a heated substance.
● Thermodynamic Radiation is heat transfer due to electromagnetic radiation.
Stefan's Law: the power (P) radiated by a body is proportional to its area (A) and to the fourth power
of its temperature (T): P = AT4.
Ideal Gases
An ideal gas is assumed to consist of identical point masses undergoing perfectly elastic collisions
with each other and with their container. Ideal Gas Law: the pressure and volume of an ideal gas are
proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to each other: PV = RT. The pressure of an
ideal gas is proportional to both the number of molecules per unit volume and the average kinetic
energy per molecule.
Laws of Thermodynamics
The laws of thermodynamics are statistical laws that only apply to systems with many particles. The
improbability of violations of these laws rises exponentially with the number of particles in the
system. For all but the most microscopic systems, these laws are effectively inviolate.
0th Law of Thermodynamics: if two bodies each are in thermal equilibrium with a third body,
then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
● 
1st Law of Thermodynamics: energy cannot be created or destroyed and thus is conserved. The
change in internal energy (dU) of a system is the difference between the heat (Q) transferred into
(or out of) the system and the work (W) done by the system: dU = Q - W.
● 
2nd Law of Thermodynamics: heat does not spontaneously flow from a cold body to a hot
body, and so the entropy of a closed system can never decrease.
● 
3rd Law of Thermodynamics: a finite process can lower a body's temperature arbitrarily close,
but not all the way, to absolute zero.
● 
Entropy
Entropy is a measure of the disorder in a system, and the change in entropy (dS) is defined as the
change in heat divided by the absolute temperature: dS = dQ / T. Isolated systems tend to increase in
entropy, and thus the entropy of the universe increases in all natural processes.
3.1.4. Natural Science / Physics / Electromagnetics
Electromagnetics: the study of the behavior of electromagnetic charge.
Light is electromagnetic radiation: the propagation of variations in the electromagnetic field. Light
defines the speed at which everything moves through space-time.
Atoms such as iron are permanent magnetic dipoles. A magnet is a macroscopic magnetic dipole
composed of multitudes of magnetic dipoles (such as iron atoms) that are locked in alignment.
3.1.5. Natural Science / Physics / Quantum Physics
Quantum Physics: the study of the smallest amounts of matter and radiation.
Motivating Phenomena
The atomic theory of matter was inferred from the integral ratios of elements comprising chemical
compounds, the successes of the kinetic theory of gases, and the Brownian motion of particles
suspended in water. The nuclear theory of atoms was inferred from the existence of electrons,
radioactivity, and especially the scattering of alpha particles directed at thin foils. Quantum theory was
inferred from
● the stability of the electron orbits in atoms, and their associated spectral lines;
● the finite amount of ultraviolet radiation from heated bodies;
● the dependency of photoelectricity on light frequency and not intensity; and
● Compton scattering of X-rays from electrons.
Several different phenomena exemplify the differences between classical and quantum physics.
Double-slit interference. Quanta (e.g. photons or electrons) are emitted one by one toward a
screen protected by a barrier with two slits. When it is checked which slit each quantum passes
● 
through, they impact the screen directly behind the transited slit. When it is not checked, they
impact the screen in an interference pattern suggesting that each quantum travels as a wave
through both slits and interferes with itself.
Non-locality. Twin particles are emitted in opposite directions so that they have opposite spin.
The spin, like the path through the double-slit, is indeterminate until measured. A measurement
of one particle's spin instantaneously determines the other's, even if they are light-years apart.
● 
Delayed choice. In a modified double-slit experiment, one may choose to replace the screen, a
moment before each quantum hits it, with a detector that can determine which slit the quantum
transited. The choice can happen well after the quantum has transited the slitted barrier, and yet
this delayed choice again determines whether the quantum self-interferes on the screen or is
counted by one of the two detectors.
● 
Principles
Quantization. A quantum is a discrete unit of some physical property or phenomenon. A property or
phenomenon is quantized if it can only occur in discrete units. In addition to the quantized fundamental
properties, quantized phenomena include:
● matter, the fundamental quanta of which are quarks and leptons;
● action, which is quantized as a function of Planck's constant h;
● vibration, the quanta of which are called phonons;
● electric conduction;
● thermal conduction
Wave-particle duality. Every quantum has both wave-like and particle-like properties. As
demonstrated in double-slit interference, quanta travel like waves but arrive like particles.
Complementarity. Quanta have complementary properties that cannot be observed or measured
simultaneously. Complementary properties include:
● position and linear momentum;
● energy and time; and
● angular momentum along the three spatial axes.
Indeterminacy. Different quanta in the same state can nevertheless behave differently, for example by
undergoing radioactive decay at different times. This is not due simply to observers lacking
information about determinate underlying variables that could, if known, be used to predict the
behavioral differences. Instead, as Heisenberg proposed in 1927, the indeterminacy is built in at the
lowest level. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that complementary properties cannot be
measured simultaneously and in fact have no precise definite value, measurable or not.
Fields
A field is a region in which a force or effect exists. Changes in fields propagate at the speed of light.
All the fields observed in nature are continuous over space and time, are (or are thought to be)
quantized in their particle interactions, and exhibit gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry is an invariance
at each point in space and time. There are fields associated with each of the fundamental forces.
The weak force is chiral: it includes phenomena whose mirror-reflected counterparts seem never to
occur. This is strong evidence that there must be an odd number of space-like dimensions, since
chirality cannot exist in an even number of space-like dimensions. (Reflection along an even number of
axes is equivalent to rotation, and invariance under rotation is a fundamental symmetry in nature.)
Field theories.
Quantum Mechanics is the quantum theory of atomic structure and associated radiation that
was developed in the 1920s.
● 
Quantum Electrodynamics is the quantum theory of electromagnetism that was developed in
the 1940s.
● 
Electroweak Theory is the unified quantum theory of the electromagnetic and weak forces that
was developed in the 1960s.
● 
Quantum Chromodynamics is the quantum theory of the strong force that was developed in
the late 1960s.
● 
The Standard Model is the unification of electroweak theory and quantum chromodynamics
that was developed in the early 1970s and that explains all observed particle interactions except
those due to gravity.
● 
String Theory or M Theory is a proposed quantum theory of all particles and fields, based on
one-dimensional "strings" resonating in a ten-dimensional space-time whose six extra space-like
dimensions are "curled up" at each point, just as a hose is a one-dimensional line with a small
two-dimensional circular cross-section at each point.
● 
Particles
A particle is a quantum of matter or energy that has observable position. The most basic way to
classify particles is according to their angular momentum.
Fermions are all subatomic particles that have the half-integral angular momentum that subjects
them to the Pauli exclusion principle, and include quarks, leptons, baryons, and nuclei of odd
mass number.
● 
Bosons are all subatomic particles that have the integral angular momentum that exempts them
from the Pauli exclusion principle, and include gauge bosons, mesons, and nuclei of even mass
number.
● 
Another classification of particles is according to how they are composed of constituent
particles.Hadrons are baryons and mesons: the subatomic particles composed of quarks and thus
subject to the strong nuclear force.
Mesons are short-lived spin-zero bosons that are composed of a quark and antiquark and that
quickly decay into other particles.
● 
Baryons are fermions, such as the proton and neutron, that are composed of three quarks, and
that have baryon number of ±1.
Nucleons are either of the two kinds of baryons (protons and neutrons) that constitute
atomic nuclei and thus account for over 99.9% of the mass of atomic matter.
Protons are positively-charged nucleons that are composed of two up quarks and
one down quark, that are the essential constituents of the atomic nuclei of ordinary
matter, and that have an average life of at least 1032 years.
■ 
Neutrons are uncharged nucleons that are composed of one up quark and two down
quarks, that account for differing isotopes by their varying numbers inside atomic
nuclei, and that are the seed of nuclear radioactivity due to the instability that makes
their average free life last only about 900 seconds.
■ 
❍ 
● 
Atoms are particles that consist of electrons orbiting a nucleus composed of nucleons, that are the
smallest units into which matter can be divided without releasing electrical charge, and that are the
characteristic units of chemical elements. A nucleus is the tiny dense positively-charged central core of
an atom, consisting of neutrons and mutually-repelling protons that are held together by the strong
force and that attract electrons into orbiting quantum shells that give the atom its chemical properties.
Interpretation
A quantum system remains in an indeterminate but deterministically-evolving state until the next
measurement or observation event. Such an event happens when the function has interacted with other
wave functions to an effectively irreversible degree. Observation of an event is thus the irreversible
widening of the scope of influence of the event. Observation "collapses" the wave function
discontinuously and non-deterministically into a particular determinate state.
Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory is that reality should not be assumed to have
properties that exist independently of their being measured. Einstein's hidden variables hypothesis is
that future physical theories will reveal that the fundamental properties of reality have values that are
independent of their being measured. Everett's many worlds hypothesis is that at each measurement or
observation event the universe branches into a separate universe for each possible outcome of the
event. The hidden variables hypothesis is not supported by available
evidence. The many worlds hypothesis is unfalsifiable, unverifiable,
and therefor meaningless.
Quantum indeterminacy is on such a small scale that it is unlikely to affect macroscopic processes such
as volition in the brain. However, quantum indeterminacy does in principle make strong free will
possible. At the same time, too much indeterminacy would threaten to undermine the ethically more
important property of weak free will.
If quantum indeterminacy did not exist (i.e. if Planck's constant were zero), then it seems that
an arbitrarily small volume of space-time could contain an arbitrarily large amount of
information. The positions of the particles in any volume could in principle be measured to
arbitrary precision, extracting arbitrary amounts of information. Similarly, the positions of the
particles could in principle be adjusted to arbitrary precision, thus storing arbitrary amounts of
information. Completely faithful and precise simulations of actual physical subsystems would
be impossible, because infinite amounts of information would be required to accurately
specify the positions of particles. Quantum indeterminacy thus seems consistent with the
logical possibility that the universe is in fact a simulation running on some computational
substrate (whose random number generator would constitute the ultimate hidden variable). Of
course, since this possibility is probably unverifiable, parsimony requires that it be rejected
pending other evidence.
Mysteries
What determines the particular mass values of quarks and leptons? Do protons ever decay, implying
that quarks and leptons can be interconverted by means of some new gauge boson? Why are there
precisely three generations of fundamental particles?

3.2.1. Natural Science/ Astronomy / Cosmology
The physical universe is everything that is, has been, or ever might be in causal contact with Earth.
The observable universe is that part of the universe that is or has been in causal contact with Earth.
Human knowledge of the universe outside the observable universe is limited by the rate at which
Earth's sphere of causal contact is growing (namely, the speed of light).
Origin of the Universe
Spacetime; what was before the Big Bang? What caused the Big Bang?
Big Bang. evidence: 2.73K blackbody radiation, Hubble's Law (good to 1 part per million)
Inflation explains why the universe is isotropic, by allowing opposite ends of the observable universe
to have once been in causal contact, even though today they are 20 Gly apart. Inflation also explains
why the observable universe appears flat.
History of the Universe
Graph universe's size, temperature, density on log-log scale
Nature of the Universe
The universe is believed to have no boundary in the three familiar dimensions, in the same sense that a
sphere has no boundary in the two dimensions of its surface. Thus the universe has no end or edge, and
so nothing is outside the universe or "beyond its edge". For the size of the universe, humans only know
a lower bound -- namely, the size of the observable universe -- and probably cannot know an upper
bound, although it is often assumed to be finite.
The observable universe is about 12-14 billion light-years in radius. At the limits of our observation are
the Big Bang singularity (for the time-like dimension) and just-now-visible parts of the universe (for
the space-like dimensions).

Earth Impacts
"The four largest terrestrial-impact craters known: Chesapeake Bay on the East Coast of the United
States and Popagai in Siberia (both dated at 35 million years), Chicxulub on the Yucatán peninsula (65
million years old and suspected of being produced by the impactor that may have killed the dinosaurs)
and Manicouagan in Quebec (dated at 210 million years)."
Space Exploration
Voyager. In February 1991, from a vantage point 3.7 billion miles from Earth and about 32 (35?)
degrees above the plane of the ecliptic, Voyager 1 returned an historic "family portrait" of nearly all the
planets in our solar system. Voyager 1 is now farther from Earth than any other spacecraft, and is
travelling at 63 Mm/h in the opposite direction as Pioneer 10. Voyager 1 is escaping the solar system at
a speed of about 3.5 AU per year, 35 degrees out of the ecliptic plane to the north, in the general
direction of the Solar Apex (the direction of the Sun's motion relative to nearby stars). Voyager 1 will
leave the solar system aiming toward the constellation Ophiuchus. In the year 40,272 AD, Voyager 1
will come within 1.7 light years of an obscure star in the constellation Ursa Minor (the Little Bear or
Little Dipper) called AC+79 3888.
Voyager 2 is departing southward at 56 Mm/h, 48 degrees out of the ecliptic plane to the south toward
the constellations of Sagitarrius and Pavo. In about 40,000 years, Voyager 2 will come within about 1.7
light years of a star called Ross 248, a small star in the constellation of Andromeda
Pioneer. Pioneer 11is headed toward the constellation of Aquila (The Eagle), Northwest of the
constellation of Sagittarius. Pioneer 11 may pass near one of the stars in the constellation in about 4
million years.

Life is functional organization for sustaining self and kind involving active use of energy and
information replication, respectively. Living is functioning organization for sustaining self as part of a
system that constitutes life. Death is the irreversible cessation of living. A wide variety of systems
undergo replication or are self-sustaining, but not all of those systems are alive.
Replicas are entities whose kind is sustained by copying.
Replicators are entities which sustain their kind by copying themselves.
Living replicators make active use of energy to sustain themselves.
Organisms are any entity which is or once was living and that is of the kind
sustained by its functional organization.
Spores and fertilized seeds are organisms because they can germinate
even if dormant for up to thousands of years.
■ 
Immature organisms such as zygotes, embryos, fetuses, and children
are all nevertheless organisms.
■ 
Mutualist and parasitic symbionts are distinct organisms only to the
extent that they are of a kind being sustained distinctly. If the
sustaining of their kinds is inextricably linked (as with mitochondria
and their host cells), then they are part of the same organism.
■ 
Artifacts (such as robots) can be organisms if they sustain self and
kind. If they are obligate mutualists with another artifact (e.g. a factory
for building robot-factory-building-and-sustaining robots), then they
are each in effect a separate sex of a common species.
■ 
Sterile organisms such as mules and worker bees are alive because
they sustain themselves and are part of a functional organization for
sustaining kind.
■ 
Dormant organisms such as hibernators remain alive insofar as they
have the possibility and likelihood of continued living. Fallible
knowledge of such possibilities and likelihoods can make it
non-obvious whether an organism should be considered dead.
■ 
Immortal organisms that no longer replicate are nevertheless
organisms if they have parents (and not just producers).
■ 
■ 
Sub-organismic replicators like cells, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and
gametes are not organisms because, while they sustain and replicate
themselves, they are not of the kind that they are organized to sustain.
■ 
Artificial life is life that exists in a simulation and uses simulated energy
instead of real energy. If the universe is a simulation, then all known terran
life is in fact artificial life, but life nonetheless.
■ 
■ 
Self-catalyzing replicators make no active use of energy but are structured to
cause copying of themselves. They are not alive because they do not use energy or
other resources to sustain themselves and in fact usually have unchanging internal
state.
■ Viruses, viroids, and prions
■ Genotypes, chromosomes, and genes
■ 
❍ 
● 
■ Software viruses and worms
■ Chain letters, religious beliefs
Replicants are entities which are copied but do not copy themselves.
Memes are patterns of information which tend to get replicated from one mind to
another. Ideas, words, languages, jokes, stories, texts, images, etc. are all memes or
meme complexes.
■ 
Artifacts such as cars or robots can be described in physiological terms and yet are
not alive because they do not reproduce and do not even really sustain themselves.
■ 
❍ 
Self-sustaining non-replicas
Communities such as families and societies sustain themselves but are not alive because
they are not truly replicated.
❍ 
Sub-organismic components such as limbs and organs are alive but are not organisms
because they do not replicate themselves.
❍ 
Self-sustaining processes such as fires, tornados and stars are not alive because they have
no functional organization.

Cybernetic Systems: systems that control and coordinate the operations of organisms.
In terran organisms, cybernetic systems consist primarily of endocrine and nervous systems.
Endocrine Systems
Nervous Systems
A nervous system is in terran organisms a network of neurons organized to process sensations and
produce behaviors. A neuron is a cell that processes electrochemical stimuli received from its
branch-like dendrites and at some threshold emits a characteristic electrochemical response along its
single outgoing axon. Signals travel in the nervous system at speeds of up to 100 m/s.
The brain is the part of the vertebrate nervous system responsible for regulating and controlling bodily
activities, including autonomic functions, sensation, movement, and cognition. The brain stem
controls most autonomic functions and is involved in emotional and reproductive behavior. The
cerebellum controls voluntary muscular activities. The cerebrum is responsible for sensation, volition,
and cognition.
Inputs to Nervous Systems
Nervous systems are sensitive to a wide variety of stimuli.
Mechanoreception is sensitivity to mechanical stimuli.
Tangoreception is sensitivity to touch, and is found in almost all kinds of organisms.
Vibrations in touched objects can be sensed by many animals.
❍ 
Air and water displacement can be sensed by many invertebrates and aquatic vertebrates.
Water pressure can be sensed by many aquatic animals.
❍ 
Most animals use internal mechanoreceptors to sense the movements and positions of their
own body parts.
❍ 
Statoreception is sensitivity to acceleration (such as caused by gravity), and is found in
most animals. Invertebrate (but not insect) statoreception senses the disposition of a
mineral particle in specialized vesicles. Vertebrate statoreception senses the disposition of
calcium carbonate particles in the inner ear.
❍ 
● 
● Thermoreception is sensitivity to temperature.
Chemoreception is sensitivity to chemicals, and is found in all animals. Taste is contact
chemoreception of water-soluble substances. Smell is distance chemoreception of
water-insoluble vaporous substances.
● 
Photoreception is sensitivity to light and its polarization. Humans have photoreceptors that are
specially sensitized to red, green, and blue light, and are unable to distinguish between mixtures
of these three and pure samples of other colors. Humans can see light between 400 nm and 750
nm, and flickering up to 60 Hz.
● 
Sonoreception is sensitivity to sound. Animal sonoreception can detect sounds as low as 0.1 Hz
(pigeon) and as high as 240 KHz (moth). Humans can hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20 KHz.
● 
Echolocation is the emission of sounds and the sensing of their reflections in order to perceive
nearby reflecting objects. Echolocation is found in bats and toothed whales.
Electroreception is sensitivity to electrical stimuli, and is found in certain kinds of fish and in
the platypus. Some eels are able to generate a local electric field in order to detect changes in it
caused by prey. Certain insects and birds appear able to sense magnetic fields.
● 
Functions of Nervous Systems
Autonomic functions.
Movement.
Pain.
Perception.
Appetitive Behavior. Fighting, fleeing, mating, feeding, etc.
Cognitive Behavior. All human cognitive functions seem to consist ultimately in the activation and
modulation of synaptic connections in the cerebrum. The human cerebrum is divided into two
hemispheres, one of which is dominant in each individual. The dominant hemisphere is responsible for
language, mathematics, and handedness. The other hemisphere is responsible for face recognition and
emotional, spatial, and musical processing.
The frontal lobes of the cerebrum are responsible for attention, volition, planning, and conscience. The
motor cortex of each frontal lobe controls the voluntary muscles of the body's opposite side. The
somatosensory cortex of each parietal lobe receives and integrates input from mechanoreceptors and
thermoreceptors on the body's opposite side. The visual cortex in each occipital lobe processes input
from the opposing half of each eye's visual field, providing e.g. recognition of faces and perception of
motion. The auditory cortex in each temporal lobe processes auditory input from both sides of the
body, and has areas for the comprehension and production of language. The non-dominant temporal
lobe analyzes the emotional content of faces.
Immediate memory seems to be stored in the frontal lobes. Short-term memory is processed by the
hippocampus. Episodic long-term memory seems to be stored in the temporal lobes, whereas the
parietal lobes seem responsible for general long-term memory. Long-term memories seem not to be
stored at particular points in the brain, but rather in diffuse associative networks.
How are memories created, stored, recalled, and forgotten? How does the brain
understand and generate language? How does the brain perform learning and
reasoning? What happens in the brain as it makes a decision? How does the
brain generate and process emotions? How does the brain control attention?
What is the neurophysiological purpose, if any, of sleeping and dreaming?

Evolution
Evolution is accumulated change in a lineage of entities through inheritance of new variation. All
known terran organisms are related by their evolution from common origins. In particular, humans and
all other primates evolved from a common ancestor. The tens of millions of species living on Earth
were all created by a process of evolution from common origins that also created hundreds of millions
of species now extinct.
Evolution is not simply any change in an entity. Individual organisms develop, not evolve. Evolution
does not inevitably cause "progress" toward "higher" forms. Evolution can remove features (such as
eyes and limbs) as well as add them. Evolution is not constrained to creating increasing complexity. 
However, as an ecosystem develops, extremes of complexity can become more likely due to
accumulation of complicating changes in some lineages.
Evidence for Evolution
There are several different major kinds of evidence for evolution.
Taxonomical evidence shows that all terran organisms fit into taxonomical categories suggesting
phylogenetic relationships.
● 
Genetic evidence reveals details of phylogenetic relationships, extending (and largely
confirming) the taxonomical understanding of phylogeny. Genetic evidence also shows that all
terran life shares common origins.
● 
Paleontological evidence reveals an increasingly detailed fossil record of the missing links and
dead ends in the family tree of terran life.
● 
Physiological and biochemical evidence includes myriad homologies of anatomy, embryonic
development, and biochemistry that confirm and elaborate how organisms are related.
Particularly telling are the anatomical vestiges and evolutionary imperfections that show how
blind evolution can be.
● 
Biogeographical evidence shows how isolated populations are subject to evolutionary
divergence and convergence.
● 
Convergent evolution occurs when taxa under similar selective pressures come to share a trait that their
common ancestors did not share. Convergent evolution is particularly interesting because it suggests
the topology of the design space that evolution searches. For important evolutionary pathways like
those resulting in sociality and intelligence, convergent evolution hints at how likely they were on
Earth and how likely they might be elsewhere.
Trait convergence occurs when a single trait is shared.
❍ Fish and cetaceans have both evolved streamlining, tail propulsion, and fin steering.
❍ Pterodactyls, birds, and bats all evolved wings from their tetrapodal forelimbs.
❍ Pinnipeds and penguins both evolved propulsive fins from their tetrapodal forelimbs.
❍ Cetaceans and bats both evolved echolocation.
❍ Mole rats and many insects evolved eusociality.
● 
❍ Cephalopods and vertebrates both evolved camera-like eyes.
Niche convergence occurs when geographically separated taxa become so similarly adapted that
they exploit similar niches.
The marsupials of Australia are more closely related to each other than to placental
mammals, and yet include organisms similar to the wolf, big cat, flying squirrel, anteater,
mole, mouse, and hare.
❍ 
Africa, South America, and other isolated locales have evolved multiple separate analogs
of the ostrich, hare, anteater, and cactus.
❍ 
● 
Natural Selection
Natural selection is differential reproductive success due to inherited variation. Natural selection is the
most important factor in the evolution of terran life. Sexual selection is a form of natural selection in
which competition for mates causes differences in reproductive success and a resulting exaggeration of
traits that aid in mate competition.
Natural selection acts on individual organisms, and not on groups or species of organisms.
The inclusive fitness of an individual organism is the relative number of its alleles that are passed on to
subsequent generations by the organism or its relatives. Natural selection favors variations that
increase a genotype's inclusive fitness. Natural selection for maximum inclusive fitness can lead some
individuals to forego reproduction in order to help relatives reproduce. It can lead other individuals to
compete with parents or siblings, cheat on mates, or commit infanticide against a mate's unrelated
offspring.

Genesis
How precisely did life on Earth arise? Life on Earth is probably the result of a long series of
increasingly complex auto-catalytic cycles of molecular synthesis that were subject to preferential
replication through natural selection. Humans will require decades or even centuries to reconstruct
through theory and experiment the details of how life arose. How probable or improbable was
the beginning of life on Earth? Humans do not yet know, but the case for probability is being
strengthened by both a) earlier estimates of how soon life arose after the Earth formed, and b) an
increasing understanding of the steps genesis may have taken.
The methane, ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide on the early Earth would have been readily
combined by lightning, heat, or ultraviolet radiation into organic molecules like amino acids, sugars,
and nucleic acids. Clays or other mineral surfaces may have served as catalysts or concentrators for
polymerization of these organic molecules. Nucleotide phosphates could have spontaneously
assembled into polynucleotides, which then would be templates for further such assembly. Errors in
copying could have led to a population of various replicating polynucleotides. Some polynucleotides
could have weakly but selectively bonded with particular amino acids to construct various proteins.
Any polynucleotide whose associated protein helped catalyze that polynucleotide's assembly would
have preferentially reproduced. Mutually catalyzing cycles of protein synthesis could have caused the
evolution of enzymes.
Cells may have arisen as proteinoid microspheres forming spontaneously and helping maintain
concentrations of proteins or enzymes which themselves made microsphere formation more likely. Cell
division and reproduction may have developed from the tendency of some microspheres to rupture
(perhaps after some form of growth) into two or more spheres. Natural selection would favor those
resulting spheres that retained a complement of nucleic acids, proteins, and enzymes sufficient to
continue the sphere's cyclical catalysis, which would at some point be considered the metabolism of a
spherical cell.
The earliest bacteria were chemotrophs deriving energy from inorganic chemicals in their environment,
but around 3.5 Gya some bacteria evolved into phototrophs that could capture and store the energy
from sunlight. The earliest first form of photosynthesis split hydrogen sulfide to produce ATP and
waste sulfure.

Evolution of Intelligence
While certain birds and cephalopods are somewhat intelligent, the most intelligent terran organisms are
all mammals: Hominoidea, Cetacea, Carnivora, Pinnipedia, and Proboscidea. There are several
interrelated factors that correlate with terran intelligence and have probably been mutually reinforcing
with it.
Dynamic sociality. The most important contributor to the evolution of intelligence is probably
social (as opposed to herd or individual) living with dynamically differential status among
individuals. Intelligence aids in recognition of and adaptation to complex and changing social
hierarchies, and especially in alliances with and against other groupmates trying to apply their
own intelligence.
● 
● Longevity allows for amortization of learning costs and enables social memory (culture).
Long adolescence and limited litter size allows time and resources for learning, and reinforces
the need for sociality.
● 
● Large body size helps support a large and biologically costly brain, and reinforces longevity.
Food-chain superiority (though not necessarily supremacy), often as a predator or else as
relative non-prey, contributes to longevity and is contributed to by large size, sociality, and
intelligence itself.
● 
What are the precise evolutionary pressures and paths that led to increased
intelligence in many mammals and certain birds and cephalopods? There no doubt
are limits to how fully humans will ever be able to answer this essentially historical question.

Evolution of Hominid Intelligence
How did hominid intelligence evolve? This question may never have a fully satisfying
answer. It is unlikely that tool use led to bipedality, since the fossil record shows bipedality preceded
larger brains and the earliest tools. Bipedaliy was more likely a response to the change of East Africa's
climate from forest to savanna, where brachiating is less important than seeing over high grasses.
Decreasing sexual dimorphism suggests more-monogamous pair-bonding, and supplemental male
provisioning of nuclear families may have co-developed with bipedality. Concealed female ovulation
and continual female sexual receptivity both probably contributed to increased male-male cooperation
and tighter pair bonding. Such changing social patterns probably increased the selective pressure for
intelligence, as did the availability of the hands for tool use following bipedality. The parallel increase
in tool use and the size of the metabolically expensive brain was associated with a more omnivorous
diet that included scavenging and hunting of meat.
How did Homo sapiens acquire language? This question, too, will likely never have a fully
satisfying answer, as the fossil record tells even less about the development of language than it does
about the development of intelligence. Just as sociality was crucial to the evolution of intelligence in
animals, it probably also created selective pressure for the development of language skills. A variety of
particular factors and stages have been proposed.
● Gestural and vocal imitation and miming
Object and action reference by association through pointing or miming, perhaps motivated by
the cooperative or imitative use of tools
● 
● Counting as aiding a transition from iconic to symbolic representation
Complex neural systems for perception or planned motor control as being adaptable to speech
organ control and even syntax production
● 
● Imperatives and interrogatives as earliest sentences
Planning of future actions and understanding of others' intent as enabling more sophisticated
syntactic structures
● 
The result has been neural systems in the human brain that are highly specialized for language.

5.1. Social Science / Economics
Economics: the study of production, exchange, and consumption of goods by persons.
1. Macroeconomics.
2. Microeconomics.
Fundamental Concepts
Economic value is utility or desirability to persons, especially as determined by free markets. Goods
are anything which has economic value. The economic cost of a good is the economic value of the
goods and resources expended to produce it. Economic efficiency is economic value divided by
economic cost.
Production is the transformation of economic resources into goods. Economic resources are any
natural resources, human resources, or capital resources that are useful for production. Capital is any
product that is has utility for production. Human resources are the labor, skills, and knowledge of
persons.
Exchange is the trading of goods for money or for other goods. A market is any mechanism for
buyers and sellers to exchange goods. A free market is a market in which buyers and sellers are
generally free to decide what to exchange and under what terms. Money is anything generally accepted
as a medium of exchange and thus useful for storing or measuring economic value. The price of a good
is the amount of economic value that must be exchanged to acquire it. Demand is willingness and
ability to buy. Supply is availability and proffer for sale. The scarcity of a good is the excess of its
demand over its supply, and in a free market is measured by price.
Consumption is any use of goods that subtracts from wealth without adding to production. Wealth is
the economic value of what one owns minus what one owes. Income is change in net wealth plus the
value of goods consumed.
Assumptions and Idealizations
Assumptions. Goods and resources tend to be scarce. Economic actors tend to choose rationally to
maximize wealth. In particular, producers choose to maximize profits, and consumers choose to
maximize utility.
Idealizations. Producers and consumers have complete information about the prices and quality of all
goods available or demanded in the market. Markets for particular kinds of goods are not dominated by
a relatively few sellers or buyers. Sellers are able to exclude potential buyers from consuming the
sellers' goods without buying them. Under perfect competition, markets tend toward equilibrium.
Mathematical proof has been given of the theoretical existence of at least one set of prices that will
clear all markets simultaneously.
Principles
The law of demand states that the price of a good is inversely proportional to the quantity demanded.
The law of supply states that the price of a good is proportional to the quantity demanded. The law of
diminishing marginal utility states that the amount of marginal utility derived from a good diminishes
with the amount consumed of that good. The principle of comparative advantage states that overall
efficiency is maximized if market participants import the products they make least efficiently and
export the products they make most efficiently, even if those products are made more efficiently by
other participants.
Free Markets. Free trade benefits all parties, even those absolutely more efficient than others. Routine
consensual transactions are positive sum, because if either party suffered a loss then she would decline
to make the transaction routine. Free markets are the most efficient way to determine the allocation of
economic resources and the distribution of goods. The decentralized mechanism of free market pricing
is able to ration goods and resources more efficiently than could any central planning agency. This is
because the pricing system transmits information about supply and demand more efficiently than could
any planning agency. The pricing system forces economic actors to reveal their demand, and forces
firms to supply only what is demanded.
Natural resources over time become less costly and thus less scarce. Population growth leads to
increased specialization, increased productivity, increased living standards, and a cleaner environment.
Misunderstandings
Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) wrote in his 1798 Essay on the Principle of Population that geometric
population growth would overwhelm arithmetic growth in agricultural output and thus doom humanity
to subsistence living. Malthus was wrong for two reasons. 1) Technological
advances have slowed population growth by turning children into net
consumers for their family instead of net producers. 2) Technological
advances have increased agricultural output faster than population
has increased.
Marxism is the belief in the labor theory of value and its consequent conclusion that any profits by
private owners of capital are unjustified and exploitive. The labor theory of value states that the value
of a good is precisely the amount of labor required for producing it. The labor theory of
value ignores the fact that capital contributes to value by making
labor more productive.
5.1.1. Social Science / Economics / Macroeconomics
Inflation is any increase in overall prices. Deflation is any decrease in overall prices. The real interest
rate is the difference between the nominal interest rate and inflation. Inflation over the
long term is not caused by excess demand, or production being close
to capacity, or inflationary expectations. Inflation over the long
term cannot be "wrung out" of the economy through higher
unemployment. Inflation (and deflation) over the long term can only be caused by the money
supply growing (or shrinking) relative to aggregate output. Inflation is a tax on dollar-denominated
assets, and also transfers wealth from creditors to debtors.
Gross domestic product is the market value of the total production in a year of all the factors of
production located in a nation. Gross national product is the total production in a year of all the
factors of production owned by a nation. The Gross World Product in 1999 was estimated to be $40.7
trillion. Total human wealth has been estimated at $500 trillion. Recession is any decrease in gross
domestic product that lasts at least six months. Depression is any recession so severe that GDP drops at
least 10%. Growth is any increase in gross domestic product. Growth is caused by increases in any or
all of: capital stock, capital efficiency, labor supply, or labor productivity.
How can real (as opposed to nominal) production and productivity be accurately
measured over the long term? Knowledge and technology can create qualitative improvements
in goods and services that confound historical comparisons of real production.
Unemployment is the state of unsuccessfully seeking to sell labor. Frictional unemployment is the
amount of short-term unemployment caused by the process of matching jobs with job-seekers.
Structural unemployment is the amount of long-term unemployment caused by long-term changes in
the mix of job skills demanded by employers. The natural rate of unemployment is the sum of the
frictional and structural unemployment rates.
Why is unemployment in industrialized economies often closer to 10% than to
what many economists believe should be its natural rate of 1% to 3%? The most
likely explanation is some kind of ratchet effect that keeps wages from falling when demand for labor
decreases, so that unemployment substitutes for wage cuts. There are perhaps sociological reasons why
employers and employees are reluctant to see wages cut. Also, minimum wage laws probably cause
some of the unemployment of low-productivity workers.
The three major markets in the economy are those for goods, labor, and money.
Aggregate output (Y) is the total real (i.e. not nominal) market value of all production during a
given period, and is equal to the total income: C + S + T.
● 
Disposable income (Yd ● ) is aggregate income minus net taxes: Y - T.
Aggregate consumption (C) is the total real (i.e. not nominal) market value of all consumption
during a given period.
● 
● Aggregate savings (S) is aggregate output minus aggregate consumption: Y - C - T.
● Government spending (G) is total government expenditures.
● Net taxes (T) is total tax receipts minus government transfer payments to households.
● Net exports is exports (EX) minus imports (IM).
● Planned investment (I) is the intended aggregate creation of capital.
Planned aggregate expenditure (AE) is aggregate consumption plus planned investment: C + I
+ G + (EX - IM).
● 
Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of marginal income that is consumed:
∆C/∆Y.
● 
Marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction of marginal income that is saved: ∆I/∆Y or
1 - MPC.
● 
Marginal propensity to import (MPM) is the fraction of marginal income that is spent on
imports.
● 
Equilibrium in the goods market is when AE = Y and S + T = I + G.
A multiplier is the ratio of the increase in the equilibrium level of aggregate output to the independent
increase in some input. The multipliers for planned investment I and for government spending G are
both 1/(1 - MPC + MPM), which is 1.4 [Case & Fair 1999]. The multiplier for taxation is
-MPC/MPS. The multiplier for an increase or decrease in a balanced government budget is 1.
The money supply is the amount of money in circulation, usually measured as M1 or M2. M1 is all
currency held outside banks plus all deposits against which a check may be written. M2 is M1 plus all
accounts which are easily convertible into currency, such as savings and money market accounts. The
velocity of money is the ratio of nominal GDP to the money supply.
A central bank is the institution in a nation that creates currency, regulates the money supply, and
stabilizes the banking system. The required reserve ratio is the fraction of any bank's deposits that
must be held at the nation's central bank. Banks are able to create money by making loans, but only if
they have reserves in excess of the required reserve ratio. The money multiplier is the ratio of increase
in money supply to increase in reserves.

5.1.2.1. Social Science / Economics / Microeconomics / Market Theory
An industry is the market for a particular kind of good. A firm is an organization of persons under
unified management trying to maximize profit by producing goods to meet perceived demand. Profit is
total revenue minus total cost. Pure rent is the return to any production factor that is of fixed supply.
Sunk costs are costs already incurred. Fixed costs are costs that are constant for a given level of
production. Variable costs are costs that are a function of the level of production. Marginal cost is the
cost of producing one more unit of output.
The law of diminishing returns states that applying additional units of a production factor out of
proportion to other production factors will eventually yield smaller increases in production. Additional
capital increases the productivity of labor, which increases the demand for labor, which increases the
price of labor (wages). The equilibrium price of (and return to) each production factor is equal to its
productivity as measured by marginal revenue product. Thus the standard of living for laborers is
ultimately determined by the productivity of labor.
The short run is the time scale on which there is a fixed scale of production and no entry or exit of
firms from the market. The long run is the time scale on which firms can enter or exit markets and
scale production as they choose. The productivity of a production factor is the amount of its output per
unit input. The marginal revenue product of a variable production factor is the additional revenue
earned by employing an additional unit of that factor. Investment is the creation of new capital.
Depreciation is the decline in an asset's value over time, due usually to accumulated use or
obsolescence. The present discounted value of receiving return R after time t at interest rate r is R /
(1+r)t.
Speculation is the buying and selling of goods, and especially factors of production, with the intent of
profiting from their changing market value over time. Speculation performs the socially useful function
of targeting investment to the production factors that are most productive. Even short-term speculation
performs this role, because short-term speculators must determine the net present value as it will be
perceived in the near future, which recursively depends on the long-term net present value.
Pareto optimality is the condition that obtains when no person can be made more happy without
making some person less happy.
5.1.2.2. Social Science / Economics / Microeconomics / Market Imperfections
Violations of the various assumptions about markets can lead to misallocation of resources.
Excludability is the ability of producers to detect and prevent uncompensated consumption of their
products. Rivalry is the inability of multiple consumers to consume the same good.
Monopoly is the condition of any industry in which production is controlled by a small number
of producers and for which entry by new producers is difficult. A natural monopoly is any
industry with high fixed cost and continuously declining average costs for any producer.
● 
Externality is a cost imposed or benefit bestowed on a person other than those who agreed to
the transaction that created the cost or benefit. Negative externalities are costs such as pollution
or overconsumption of natural resources. Positive externalities are benefits such as scientific
discoveries and incremental technical advances.
● 
Public goods are non-rival non-excludable positive externalities, such as national defense and
other duties of the state, that benefit essentially every person in a society. The pricing system
cannot force consumers to reveal their demand for non-excludable goods, and so cannot force
producers to meet that demand.
● 
Imperfect information is the unavailability of complete information about the prices and
quality of all goods available or demanded in the market. Adverse selection is misallocation of
resources caused by transactions among parties with differing amounts of relevant information,
such as when sellers know more about products than buyers. Moral hazard is any case in which
a contract shields a person from the consequences of their decisions and thus encourages the
wrong decisions.
● 
The Coase theorem states that markets will allocate resources and production efficiently even in the
case of externalities if a) all the relevant rights are clearly (even if unfairly) assigned, and b) transaction
costs of negotiation are minimal. The Tiebout hypothesis is that public goods can be produced
efficiently if produced locally, so that their price (in the form of local taxes and land values) reflects the
preferences of consumers free to choose where they live.
5.1.2.3. Social Science / Economics / Microeconomics / Public Policy
Taxes can be levied on either static holdings or dynamic transactions. Static taxes are of two major
kinds.
Wealth and property taxes can grow to be confiscatory and impose hardships on owners of
illiquid assets.
● 
● Capitation taxes completely disregard ability to pay.
Transaction taxes include several kinds.
Income taxes can be used for income redistribution, especially if a negative tax bracket is
included.
● 
Consumption taxes can encourage investment but tend to be regressive unless moderated by a
personal exemption.
● 
Production taxes (like value-added taxes) can be complex to administer and difficult to use as
policy tools.
● 
Resource use and access taxes may not be as efficient as allowing property rights in resources.
This applies, for example, to the tax proposed by Henry George (1839-1897) on pure economic
rent.
● 
Fees are in theory ideally fair and efficient, but in practice are difficult to assess for public
goods. Contract insurance is a proposed way to finance state operations directly from fees on its
● 
fundamental activity of enforcing contracts.
An income tax is a double tax on saving. The benefit that flows from income consumed is taxed once,
while the benefit that flows from income saved is taxed again as future income. After a given amount
of income has been earned, consuming it incurs no further tax, while saving it does.
The labor supply in an economy like America's is inelastic, in that the labor supply does not change
much when wages change. Thus payroll taxes levied on employers are actually paid by employees,
because they will generally still work for wages lowered by the tax. If the labor supply were elastic,
then employers would have to raise wages by the amount of the tax in order to keep their labor supply.
Minimum wage laws tend to increase unemployment among low-wage
earners by over-pricing their labor and thus decreasing the demand
for it. The social benefit of a minimum wage is financed through a
hidden and production-distorting tax that falls on only certain goods
and services rather than on the general tax base. Unions with
monopolistic control over the labor supply in a particular industry
enforce artificially high wages that lead to suboptimal levels of
production and employment. Rent control prevents the supply of
housing from expanding to meet the demand, and transfers income from
those unlucky enough to be landlords to those lucky enough to have
a(n increasingly scarce) lease.

Dimensions of Political Opinion
Economic and Personal Liberty. The two major dimensions of modern human political advocacy are
1) economic liberty vs. security and 2) personal liberty vs. security. Economic liberty is freedom from
coercion against one's property or resources. Economic security is safety from not having enough
property or resources. Personal liberty is freedom from coercion against one's body, expressions, or
non-coercive actions. Personal security is safety from expression or action that one considers improper.
Enfranchisement. A third important dimension is personal enfranchisement and the general
enfranchisement of beings by e.g. sentience or taxonomic endangeredness. Enfranchisement is the
recognition of rights by virtue of properties such as sentience, fetal development, age, intelligence, sex,
ethnicity, sexuality, religion, property ownership, and citizenship. Discrimination is the unfair
treatment of persons based on their possession of the properties involved in personal enfranchisement.
In theory this third dimension is independent of the first two, but in practice it correlates (imperfectly)
with the personal liberty vs. security axis. The two sorts of enfranchisement for which the correlation is
weakest are fetal status (see Pro-Choice) and citizenship. Favoring enfranchisement of non-citizens
implies support for free trade, liberal immigration, foreign aid, human rights abroad, and humanitarian
interventionism (as opposed to isolationism or imperialism). Foreign intervention has historically been
imperialist rather than humanitarian, and so doves have usually been progressives, and hawks have
usually been reactionaries.
Misunderstandings
"Pro-Choice". Many otherwise progressive thinkers subordinate any
consideration of a fetuses' franchise to the liberty of women to
control what happens inside their skin. These self-styled
progressives would never subordinate a slave's (or trespasser's)
franchise to the liberty of plantation owners to control what happens
inside their fence lines. The inconsistency seems more of an
emotional over-reaction to the recent non-enfranchisement of women at
the hands of men, and less of a clear-eyed decision to draw the line
of franchise at e.g. birth or fetal viability. Such a naked assertion
of women's entrenched interest over that of fetuses, without due
consideration and explicit rejection of fetal franchise, is hardly
progressive but rather plainly reactionary.
Thus being "pro-choice" on abortion is as disingenuous as being
"pro-choice" on slave-owning. The position actually being advocated
is the non-personhood of fetuses and slaves, respectively. But "No
personhood for fetuses" is not a very fun bumper sticker, and so
opponents of fetal personhood choose to obscure the real issue.

American Political Parties
The Democratic Party is the populist American political party which was founded in 1792 by Thomas
Jefferson, which supported state's slavery rights before the Civil War, and which was refocused by
Franklin Roosevelt toward leftist policies of welfare statism, civil rights and economic equality. As
leftists, Democrats are more likely to favor economic security over economic liberty, but personal
liberty over personal security. Democrats are more likely to prefer centralized federal solutions over
local, private or market solutions. Democrats are less likely to trust free markets to be efficient and
fair, and thus are less likely to trust individuals with economic freedom. Late 20th-century Democrat
constituencies include blacks, Jews, organized labor, hispanics, the poor, gays, urbanites, and women.
Late 20th-century Democrat policies are as follows.

The Republican Party is the American political party which was founded in 1854 to oppose slavery
and preserve the federal union, and which advocates rightist policies of economic freedom and

5.6. Social Science / History
History: the study of humanity's past.
The following history of humanity will supplement traditional political history (who did what) with
technological, intellectual, economic, and military history (how and why things were done).
5.6.1. Paleolithic History
Populations of Homo erectus had dispersed from Africa throughout Eurasia beginning around 1.5 or 2
Mya. Some time between 100 Kya and 50 Kya, anatomically modern humans (H. sapiens sapiens)
dispersed from Africa and displaced all the other Eurasian hominid populations. These humans were
characterized by specialized tools (some of bone), symbolic expression, fishing, better shelters,
improved fire control, and burials involving grave goods. It is likely that these dramatic advances were
associated with the development of fully human language.
Modern humans spread rapidly from their origins in E. Africa and SW Asia. H. sapiens sapiens arrived
in Europe 40 Kya, and by 30 Kya H. neanderthalensis was extinct. Modern humans reached Australia
from 60Kya to 40Kya, and apparently caused the extinction of much megafauna there, including the
rhino-sized marsupial herbivore Diprotodon.
European humans retreated to southern European refugia during the last glacial maximum (Wurm IV)
around 17 Kya. The end of the last ice age led to a recolonization of Europe around 13 Kya.
Farmers (or at least farming) from SW Asia spread into Europe around 8.5 Kya.

Most Important Advances
Listed below are some of the most important contingent non-parochial revolutionary advances in
human history. An advance is essentially any change that increases the complexity or capability of a
system. Advances increase what is (thought to be) possible. Non-examples are mass extinction and
nuclear war. An advance is contingent if it might not have happened, and so contingent advancements
ought not to happen independently very often. Examples are the formation of particular stars (like the
Sun) and planets (like the Earth), or the occurrence of sunrises and sunsets. An advance is parochial if
it depends on local circumstances and so is not likely to have parallels in other systems. Examples are
the European discovery of America and the fall of Communism. An advance is revolutionary if its
adoption was relatively non-incremental, compelling, and essentially irreversible. Non-examples are
democracy and free markets.

Several important advances are nonetheless either derivative or not quite revolutionary.
Television is derivative of radio telecommunication. The train and automobile are derivative of
the heat engine.
● 
Economic theory has been important but largely cumulative instead of truly revolutionary. There
was no single invention of money. The first corporation was as early as 1602. Theoretical work
by Smith (1776), Marx (1848), Keynes (1936), and Friedman (1963) was important but never
completely compelling.
● 
Political theory too has been important but largely cumulative instead of truly revolutionary.
Developments in Greece, Rome, England, and America were often literally revolutionary but
rarely compelling in the sense that knowledge, opinion, or practice would henceforth never be
quite the same.
● 
Mathematical logic was synthesized in the late 1800s and early 1900s by workers like Boole,
Frege, Peano, Cantor, Russell, Zermelo, and Godel. The cumulative impact of mathematical
logic has been revolutionary, and includes both the constituent revolutions of Cantor's Set
Theory and Godel's Incompleteness. However, for the larger programme of mathematical logic,
no single year or worker can be used to mark its beginning or turning point.

Future History
Humanity will enjoy increasing political and economic liberty, as well as increasing freedom
from ignorance and superstition. Humanity will enjoy increasing prosperity and steady
progress within the limits defined by the laws of physics. Effective immortality may result from
technology allowing avhuman mind to sustain its brain or perhaps transform itself into an
intelligent artifact. Human civilization will experience neither salvation nor extermination by
nature, machines, aliens, or gods. Humanity will spread throughout the Solar System and into
the Milky Way, and be enriched by contact with other intelligent species and artifacts.
Eventually humanity's descendants will so improve their genes and minds that Homo sapiens
will exist primarily as a revered memory.
Technological Revolutions
The long-term history and fate of humanity is driven almost entirely by technology. There have been
five great technological revolutions in hominid history, and one or two others are faintly visible on the 
horizon.
Tools. The penultimate great biological advance on Earth was the evolution of hominid intelligence. 
This led directly to the hominids' first great technological revolution at the beginning of the Paleolithic
Age by 2 Mya: the use of stone tools and (later) fire. Tools and fire granted to hominids a mastery over
predators, prey, and the elements that was literally unimaginable to other primates.
Language. The second technological revolution was also the most recent great biological advance on
Earth: the development of language by 50 Kya. The development of language, watercraft, and weaving
combined to allow early modern humans from Africa and SW Asia to master climates and locales
throughout the world.
Agriculture. The third revolution was the development of agriculture at the beginning of the Neolithic
Age about 10 Kya. The resulting specialization led to the advanced development of writing,
government, and science.
Industry. The fourth revolution was the Industrial Revolution that was under way by 1840. It included
the development of heat engines, medicine, electromagnetics, and (later) atomics. The Industrial
Revolution was of course only possible because the Scientific Revolution that began during the
Renaissance. However, it was not until the Industrial Revolution that living standards finally made a
leap to levels that would have been unimaginable to Aristotle or even Newton.
Information. The fifth revolution is the current Information Revolution. It had started by 1971 with
the development of electronics, computing, and networking, which together had major impacts on
commerce and communications by the 1980s and 1990s. The Information Revolution will continue
with the nascent developments of photonics and genetics. It will largely complete the liberation of
humanity from tyranny and superstition. It will witness the completion of humanity's basic
understanding of the origin, mechanism, and fate of mind, life, and the universe itself.
Generation. By about 2200 a sixth revolution will be under way, driven by some combination
of:
● genetic engineering of new subspecies;
● commercialized controlled fusion;
● nanotechnology;
● artifactual life; and
● artificial intelligence.
This revolution will establish the economics of the indefinite future. Design, energy, and heat
costs will be the only ones that really matter, and no future breakthroughs will ever
fundamentally reduce them again. During this phase of history, the various human societies
will arrive at economic, cultural, and linguistic parity and unity.
Homogenetics. By about 3000, modifications to the human genome will no longer be
confined to changing the frequency or expression of existing genes, but will include the
design of new genes. This will ultimately transform humanity into a new and improved
species.
Automentation. After engineering the human genome, the next (and perhaps last)
technological revolution will be to engineer the (human?) mind. The first step will be the
creation of neurological interfaces between human brains and computing devices. Another
step might be the (perhaps neuron-by-neuron) replacement of some brain components with
improved artificial parts. Or, it may be possible for a person to gradually offload mental
processing from her brain to her computational prostheses. Perhaps eventually she could
dispense with her fragile mortal brain altogether, so as to gain immortality while still
preserving personal identity.
Misunderstandings
Estimating Progress. The modern idea of Progress arose in the Enlightenment. In the subsequent few
centuries, prognosticators almost always underestimated future progress. Only towards the end of the
miraculous period of advances from 1859 to 1945 did futurologists consistently start overestimating
future progress.
The Doomsday Argument is the thesis that the future of humanity may be relatively short because a
human randomly sampled from all humans who ever will have lived is more likely to be middling in
birth rank than early. In the absence of other information about humanity's
prospects, the Doomsday Argument would be significant. In the
presence of almost any such information, the Doomsday Argument is
irrelevant.
5.7.1. Social Science / Futurology / Impossible Advances
Divine Salvation. Humans will never experience either collective or individual salvation by
any divine or supernatural agency.
Paranormality. The paranormal phenomena alleged in 2000 by many humans will never
prove to be real and will over time be recognized as delusions, hysteria, myths, nonsense,
and hoaxes.
Reanimation. There will never be any reanimation of humans whose brains have suffered
any of the degradation that occurs at normal temperatures when metabolism ceases. Human
personalities may someday be crudely simulated, but such simulations will never have
significant fidelity and would not in any event have the identity of the simulated personality.
Explanation of Somethingness. Humans will never have a definitive answer to the question
of why there is something rather than nothing. Humans may, however, eventually be able to
show that no definitive explanation of existence is possible.
Superluminal Communication. There will never be a way to travel or communicate through
space at speeds greater than that of light. Nor will there be a way to warp spacetime to
circumvent this restriction.
Temporal Travel. There will never be a way to travel or communicate backwards in time.
While time travel is not explicitly impossible under the known laws of physics, the proposed
wormhole mechanism for it would require energies and technologies that are simply not
achievable. Note also that a wormhole time machine would not allow travel back to before the
wormhole was created.
Teleporter Travel. There will never be a way for humans to travel via transmission of
information describing their physical constitution. Quantum considerations almost certainly
preclude the extraction of a sufficiently detailed description, and such a discontinuous
process would not preserve personal identity. The only possible way would be a gradual and
continuous disassembly and reassembly with an ongoing causal link between the two
separated halves.
Uploading. Like teleportation, transferal of a human mind from a brain to an artifact is almost
certainly impossible and would nevertheless not preserve personal identity. Were either
technology possible, then a minor improvement would be a non-destructive version that
preserves the original body and brain, thus revealing the technology to be a duplicator rather
than a teleporter or uploader. The possible technology closest to uploading would be a
(relatively) gradual and continuous transformation of the functioning human brain into another
substrate.
Energy and Momentum Non-Conservation. There will never be a way to increase the
available energy or change the net momentum in a closed system.
5.7.2. Social Science / Futurology / Improbable Advances
Designer Contact. In his novel Contact, Carl Sagan suggested that the universe could have
been designed and that its designer could have encoded a message in a transcendental
number such as pi or e. Such a situation does not seem logically impossible, in that it would
not be on its face a logical contradiction if for example the Bible turned out to be so encoded.
The existence of any such message would in fact have to be considered a logical necessity. If
so, it could not be considered an act of designer volition, unless one granted degrees of
freedom in the design of mathematical logic itself. Such freedom seems incompatible with the
very notion of logic: rules of inference that are binding in all possible worlds.
Super-Intelligence. Cognitive ability can increase quantitatively in efficiency, flexibility,
speed, capacity, bandwidth, and network associativity, but not qualitatively in its kind of
reasoning or knowing. There are no forms of reasoning or kinds of knowledge that are in
principle inaccessible to regular intelligence.
Human Evolution. Humanity is very unlikely to undergo significant further natural evolution. 
Since the beginning of the Neolithic Age, the development of humanity has been influenced
much more by changes in culture than changes in genes. This will continue indefinitely, even
considering genetic engineering.
Singularity. The Singularity is what Vernor Vinge describes as a moment in the future when
the ongoing exponential increases in technological capability culminate in a discontinuity
beyond which predictions based on continuous extrapolations do not apply. One candidate for
the Singularity is when humanity improves artificial intelligence to the point that it is better
than humans at improving artificial intelligence. Another candidate is when the world's
computers are networked into a single self-conscious mind. A third is when runaway
productivity is achieved through artifactual life or nanotechnology, perhaps provided by
extraterrestrial intelligence.
The Singularity will not happen. First, the limits to intelligence apply to artificial intelligence as
much as to natural. Second, intelligence is likely not to vary qualitatively as a function of
things like processing speed or memory that are increasing exponentially. Third, the effort to
make minds faster or smarter will quite likely be subject to diminishing returns. Fourth,
artificial minds will at first not be designed but rather grown and evolved, and will be subject to
most of the same limits as minds that are naturally grown and evolved.
Antigravity. There will never be a way to repel matter by virtue of its mass, or even to just
shield the attractive gravitational force of mass. Nor will there be an inertial drive -- a way to
accelerate an object uniformly, as in a gravitational field.
Vacuum or Zero-Point Energy. It is unlikely that humans will ever be able to extract useful
amounts of energy from the vacuum or zero point.
5.7.3. Social Science / Futurology / Academic Developments
Academic Developments: the trends and changes in what humans know.
Philosophy
Loss of faith. By explaining the overwhelming majority of apparent Design in the universe,
Darwin's theory of evolution made faith in a "God of the gaps" essentially indefensible among
intellectuals. As modern physics eliminates the last traces of apparent Design in the universe,
intellectual fideists have in the 20th century retreated from actual revelation-based faith. They
are seeking refuge in either outright mysticism or a false skepticism that pretends deism is a
skeptical epistemology instead of a supernaturalist metaphysics. Rank-and-file fideists are
responding variously with fundamentalism, mysticism, and (primarily) an operational
agnosticism that maintains only the trappings of faith. This hollow fideism will dilute into vague
agnostic mysticism by about 2150, while hardcore fideists will dwindle and become
increasingly isolated.
Decline of mysticism. While faith will continue to dwindle sharply, mysticism will continue to
absorb an infusion of former fideists as they confront Darwinism and are exposed to Eastern
mystical traditions. Mysticism will thereafter decline asymptotically to a core minority devoted
to altered mental states and ecological primitivism.
Spread of skepticism. The revolutions in biology and physics from 1859 to 1929, and the
subsequent technological improvements in telecommunications and productivity, will continue
to fuel the spread of humanist skepticism. In developed societies like America, belief in
revelation will dwindle as rapidly as did (for example) belief in the subhmanity of Negroids.
The decline of revelation-based faith will be somewhat disguised by its transformation into a
bland mystical reverence for the alleged intention of revelation, but the loss of dogmatic faith
will be apparent to those who bother noticing it. Key indicators will be the decreasing number
of humans who believe that their mind -- including memories, consciousness, and personality
-- will survive death, or who have serious beliefs in the paranormal.
Consolidation of philosophy. Continental philosophy will continue to thrive for at least a
century, especially among humans who misunderstand or fear the recent progress in science,
technology, and sociopolitics (viz., the ascendancy of free-market capitalism). Positivism will
be the tacit or explicit belief of those leading this ongoing progress. Positivist epistemology
and extropian ethics will in the Third Millennium displace first Continental philosophy and
eventually most competing forms of mysticism and faith. This will complete the move toward
skeptical empiricism that began in the Renaissance. Most fundamental philosophical issues
will thenceforth be considered settled, similar to how Realism and Substance Dualism are no
longer serious philosophical positions. These developments have some chance of being
altered by two technological advances: artificial intelligence, and communication with
extraterrestrial intelligence. While extropian ethics is unlikely to be affected, either advance
could offer compelling contributions to epistemology or even metaphysics. The most likely
contributions would be toward clarification and formalization, and not towards radically
alternative philosophical positions.
Mathematics
There is little prospect of fundamental advances in mathematics similar to those that
happened during the Machine Age. Future progress in mathematics will consist primarily in
formalization and in proofs such as:
● Non-existence of a polynomial-time solution for NP-complete problems
● Continuum Hypothesis
Physical Science
Fate of the universe. In the first few decades after 2000, humans will learn the fate of the
universe: collapse, infinite expansion, or asymptotic expansion. Observations in 2000 indicate
infinite expansion, but theoretical elegance argues for asymptotic expansion.
Origin of the universe. In the first few decades after 2000, humans will create a quantum
theory of gravity that will unify it with the other physical forces. By roughly 2100, humans will
learn almost all they will ever know about how the laws of physics are constrained to be the
way they are, how they allowed for the Big Bang to happen, and how many physical free
variables there are.
Biology
Genomics. Molecular biologists will continue for many centuries to sequence the genomes of
entire species and the genotypes of individual humans. This will allow an inexorably
increasing understanding of the evolutionary ancestry of earth's taxa, and of the genealogy of
earth's humans. Genomics and electronic genealogy will combine to create a worldwide
genealogical network that will include almost all humans born in literate societies after 1900
or even earlier.
Genesis. By about 2050, molecular biologists will be able to describe in increasing detail how
life based on ribonucleic and amino acids arose on Earth four billion years ago as a result of
auto-catalytic chemical processes of increasing complexity. Biologists will also be able to
estimate how probable or improbable the development of life was.
Paleontology. Over the first century or two after 2000, biologists will greatly increase human
understanding of how and why life evolved as it did over the last few billion years. In
particular, anthropology will reach a general but not detailed understanding of how and why
intelligence developed in hominids.
Exobiology. It is likely that by about 2100, humans will discover
● tangible evidence of (probably extinct) native life elsewhere in the solar system;
● spectrographic evidence of life outside the solar system;
● electromagnetic evidence of intelligence outside the solar system; or
● technological artifacts deposited in the solar system by extra-solar intelligence.
The latter two discoveries seem more likely. Any one of them will accelerate the decline of
faith and reinforce skepticism as a more attractive alternative than mysticism. If humans
discover life but not intelligence, it will emphasize the responsibility of humanity to preserve
and promote life. If humans discover neither life nor intelligence, it will emphasize the
uniqueness and preciousness of the earth's ecosystem and the intelligence it has produced.
Biochemistry. Humans will in the 2000's slowly reverse-engineer the genomes of H. sapiens
and other important terrestrial species, allowing increasingly radical genetic engineering.
Neuropsychology. Humans will in the 2000's gradually unravel the details of how the neural
processes of the human brain create mental phenomena like consciousness, cognition,
perception, affect, and volition.
Social Science
Economics. Economic theory and practice will be refined as information technology allows
the ever-improving collection and processing of economic data. However, information
technology and central planning are unlikely to ever run humanity's economy as efficiently as
the distributed processes of a free-market economy.
Sociology and Political Science. Humans will grow increasingly convinced that libertarian
capitalism under federal republican democracy is the sociopolitical system that best provides
for human justice and prosperity.
Psychology. Cognitivism will continue to be the most successful school of psychology, and
Freudianism will be more and more widely discredited. Human efforts to communicate with
cetaceans and with other primates will be tightly constrained by the limited cognitive and
linguistic ability of these animals.
Linguistics. Aided in part by human genomics, linguists will make some more progress in
tracing the family tree of human languages, but will never know many details about how the
first human languages arose and what they were like.
History. Fluctuations of theme and emphasis in the interpretation of history will continue but
will ultimately dampen out. There will not be a theory of history that can reliably predict the
future or deterministically explain the past.
5.7.4. Social Science / Futurology / Technological Developments
Technological Developments: the trends and changes in what humans know how to use.
Space
Exploration. Humans will continue robotic exploration of the solar system, including sample
return missions by 2020. Humans will establish by 2100 an unmanned radio observatory on
the far side of the moon, which is the most radio-quiet place in the solar system. Humans will
by 2200 launch robotic telescopes to use the Sun's gravitational lensing out at the edge of the
solar system. Humans will by 2300 start sending primitive Von Neumann probes to explore
the galaxy and radio their findings back to earth. By about 3000 humans will begin receiving
telemetry from high-speed flybys of nearby star systems.
Stations. Humans will by 2200 establish permanent manned stations in Earth orbit and
perhaps on the moon, primarily for microgravity and spacecraft manufacturing. Extraterrestrial
mining and mass production for terrestrial use is unlikely ever to be competitive with terrestrial
processes. Extraterrestrial energy collection or generation is likely not to be competitive with
terrestrial processes until well after Earth has too much heat pollution to be able to use the
extra energy.
Colonization. There are several reasons humans will want to establish ecologically
self-sufficient colonies beyond Earth:
● To enjoy sociopolitical independence or isolation;
● To relieve terrestrial population pressure; or
● To preserve the species in a "lifeboat".
Humans will by about 3000 create self-sustaining extraplanetary colonies, first on the moon
and Mars and later in space habitats. By 4000 the long-time citizens of a mobile space habitat
may be willing to embark on the long journey that would bring their descendants to a nearby
star system.
If attempted at all, the terraforming of Mars, Venus, or a moon of Jupiter or Saturn would
likely not begin for several thousand years and might take thousands of years more to
complete.
Quanta
Photonics, optics, and computational processing of spread-spectrum radio will lead to an
enormous increase in bandwidth by 2020.
Molecules
Nanotechnologyis the creation and use of materials and devices constructed by arranging
individual atoms and molecules. Nanotechnology will be used to create extraordinarily strong
or light materials and extraordinarily tiny and versatile machines. Self-reproducing nanotech
"assemblers" may not be feasible for several centuries, and will not be as versatile as some
would hope. The lesson of software is that even when manufacturing costs fall to zero, design
and development usually remains a unique problem for each application of the technology.
Life
Genetic Engineering. Humans will over the next few centuries use genetic engineering to
change natural organisms into increasingly useful forms. However, it will require centuries
more before humans fully understand the biochemistry of even the simplest natural living
system. After a millennium or so, humans will be able to design new ribonucleic organisms.
After perhaps another millennium, humans will be able to design organisms with
non-ribonucleic biochemistry.
Artifactual Life is life created by intelligence and not based on natural life. Humans will in
about two centuries be able to create artificial systems that can reproduce themselves. After
another century or so, humans will be able to create Von Neumann probes. A Von Neumann
probe is a device designed to travel to another star system and reproduce itself there.
Information
Computing. After 2050 the primary constraints on human computing technology will not be
processing speed or communications bandwidth or memory capacity and density, but rather
physical limits of
● heat dissipation;
● energy density of batteries;
● communications latency;
and human limits of
● sensory and cognitive I/O bandwidth;
● user understanding of software complexity;
● designer understanding of software complexity; and
● ability to specify complex requirements unambiguously.
Display technology will plateau around 2030 with a combination of affordable flat displays and
wearable retinal direct-projection systems. Neither quantum nor biochemical computing will
prove expedient.
Brain
Neuropsychology will allow the creation of neural interfaces and prosthetics for sensing,
computing and communicating. However, mind-reading technology will not improve much
beyond current polygraphs, except perhaps through invasive nanotechnology that would
probably require extensive adaptation to individual brains.
Mind
Artificial Intelligence is intelligence created by intelligence and not based on natural
intelligence. Humans will develop AI in about two hundred years. However, these systems will
initially not be designed or engineered but rather grown or raised, much as natural human
intelligences are. Another millennium may be required before humans understand the inner
workings of intelligence enough to modify or augment it.
Automentation. Will humans find a way to transform their natural brains into
artificial ones that are easier to maintain and augment? Such techniques might
depend on molecular biology and neuropsychology as much as on nanotechnology and
information processing.
Exopsychology. When (and if) humans detect extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), several
possibilities for communication will exist.
1-way transmission. If ETI is detected through electromagnetic emissions over interstellar
distances that are not intended to communicate with emerging civilizations such as earth's,
then humanity will have to introduce itself. The important issues will be what to tell and what
to ask. Humanity should tell ETI a summary of its knowledge of itself and the universe,
perhaps by sending information similar to that in this text. (The summary would have to be
made intelligible to ETI, perhaps by including a multimedia dictionary and grammar of the
relevant human language.) Humanity should ask ETI for a summary of the ETI's knowledge,
including available answers for humanity's major unanswered questions and technological
assistance in areas like communication, information processing, energy, transportation, and
materials.
1-way reception. If ETI is detected through electromagnetic signals over interstellar
distances that are intended to communicate with emerging civilizations, then there is a wide
range of possible messages the signals could encode. ETI might be broadcasting merely its
existence, telling nothing more than the sort of rudimentary information that humanity
included in its own 1974 Arecibo transmission. Another extreme possibility is that a federation
of ETIs might be broadcasting a continuously-updated "Encyclopedia Galactica" summarizing
all their knowledge. Any such message would be designed to be readily intelligible at least at
a superficial level, while advanced and detailed understanding might overtax humanity's
current linguistic or technological competence.
2-way communication. The third possibility is for 2-way communication, for which interactive
latency is the critical variable. Interstellar communication would have a latency of at least
decades or centuries, while communication with an ETI presence inside the solar system
would have a latency of at most a few hours. Interstellar 2-way communication would merely
be a series of 1-way transmissions and receptions. By contrast, intrastellar communication
could permit the exchange of time-critical information or even material goods. ETI could
greatly accelerate advances in
● mathematics;
● the physical sciences of physics, astronomy, and chemistry;
the industries of energy, transportation, materials, manufacturing, computing, and
communication; and
● 
● the fields of artifactual life and artificial intelligence.
ETI would likely confirm much human philosophy and economics, expand sociology and
political science, and significantly generalize psychology and linguistics. ETI would not be
able to advance human history or medicine, or terrestrial biology and biotechnology in
general. However, it is conceivable that ETI could give human paleontologists some data or
even biological samples acquired from Earth millions of years ago.
5.7.5. Social Science / Futurology / Industrial Developments
Industrial Developments: the trends and changes in how humans carry out their activities.
Food Production
Genetic engineering will continue to improve crop yields and hardiness. By 2050 the price of
fresh water will hit a permanent ceiling determined not by its natural supply but by the energy
cost of its desalinization and transportation. By about 4000, humans will use genetic
engineering to culture animal tissue in bulk instead of raising animals en masse. By about
5000, humans will have geno-industrial techniques for efficiently mass-producing food
consisting of only of essential nutrients (glucose, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and lipids)
and made delectable by artificial flavors or direct neurological stimuli. Human population on
earth will ultimately be limited not by food production but by heat pollution.
Sheltering
Over the next century or so, cities will be transformed from centers of industry and work to
centers of culture and entertainment. Telecommuting will blur the distinction between home
and office, and will allow humans to locate their homes by climate, culture, and time zone
rather than by proximity to industry. Undersea or aerial dwellings are not likely to ever be built
in significant numbers. Floating communities and estates will by 3000 become increasingly
popular among humans unable to afford scarce land property in desirable climates or in both
hemispheres. Human population on earth will ultimately be limited not by living space but by
heat pollution. Only when heat pollution becomes a serious problem on Earth will humans
start building significant populations beyond Earth.
Communication
Networking. Packet-switched networks like the Internet and its successors will be the
primary technology humans use for remote and mass communication for at least several
thousand years, and perhaps indefinitely. Communication costs will become independent of
distance. Bandwidth will be limited only by the deployment of fiber optic lines and wireless
local loops. Almost every device with any internal information state or human interface will
have (usually wireless) connectivity to the global network. Multi-party telepresence will allow
routine arbitrary amounts of social interaction among even distant family and friends.
Public-key cryptography will always allow secure and private communication even if network
traffic can be intercepted. Networking of ubiquitous stereo and spherically immersive
audio-video sensors will combine with satellite and topographic data to allow real-time
telepresence at, or virtual travel to, almost any interesting place on Earth. Archival storage of
such sensor data will allow a sort of read-only time-travel into the past.
Storage. Storage and recording technologies will increase in capacity, speed, and
affordability, such that the major cost associated with storage will be the intelligent effort
required to organize or digest it. Humans will by 2100 be able to digitally record, archive, and
transcribe as much as they want of what they see, hear, and say over their entire lifetimes. An
ever-increasing majority of existing text, audio, video, and images will be digitally archived
into what will be in effect a library of humanity searchable from anywhere on the global
network. Existing automated translation technology will make archived texts available in any
major human language. Real-time voice recognition will by 2010 be combined with automatic
translation and speech generation to produce a crude but effective "universal translator" that
will allow a monolingual human to converse (at least slowly and simply) with any speaker of
any major human language.
Entertainment
Media. The digitization of music will be followed by the digitization of television, movies,
books, and periodicals by 2020. This trend will lead to the routine unauthorized reproduction
and distribution of copyrighted text, images, audio, and video. Executable and perishable data
are the only data types exempt from this problem: software can decline to function if not
licensed, and live data can be hard to reproduce and distribute quickly enough. (Databases
can also be exempt, if their owners do not release entire copies and can prevent exhaustive
enumeration of the entries.) Only extreme state action could minimize such unauthorized
copying, by banning certain copying technologies.
Pre-recorded television programming will by 2030 no longer be mainly viewed on broadcast
channels carrying occasional commercials. Such viewing will first move to time-shifted
commercial-skipping recording and then to on-demand downloading financed by integrated
banner and product placement advertising as well as by voluntary micropayment tips. Even
live programming (e.g. sports and news) will have difficulty making viewers sit through
commercial breaks. Photorealistic computer-generated imagery will by 2020 replace physical
actors, sets, and locations for many video applications, but actors will still be used as input
models.
Recreation. Tourism will expand to eventually include currently inaccessible places like the
North and South Poles, the summit of Everest, seabottom shipwrecks, and even Tranquility
Base on the moon. Virtual visual and auditory reality will by 2020 be the preferred way to play
computer games. Humans will continue to play and spectate at sports, while outdoor and
wilderness recreation will increase in popularity. Dogs and cats will continue to be humans'
favorite pets, but by 2300 they will be genetically improved (e.g. not to shed) and will have
competition from pseudo-intelligent robotic "stuffed animals".
Vice. Electronic gambling and pornography will become available to any adult who wants
them, and adult access to prostitution will continue to expand. Most psychotropics will be
legalized by 2150, especially as neurochemistry becomes more able to manage the problems
of addiction and withdrawal.
Transportation
Transportation technology is mainly a function of the cost, size, and weight of energy storage
and conversion technology. As artifacts become smaller and lighter and as humans become
wealthier and more geographically dispersed, transportation will increasingly become focused
on moving humans and the water they need.
Neighborhood. For distances of up to about ten kilometers, humans will increasingly be
using battery-powered conveyances such as ultracompact cars, bicycles, and scootboards.
Human bodily flight will by 2040 have overcome problems of safety and energy cost, but
nuisance due to noise and wash will limit its use in urban areas. Nanotechnology could in
theory allow for lighter-than-air bodily flight if it could just construct a lightweight vacuum
sphere 5 meters in diameter.
Regional. For distances of up to several hundred kilometers, humans will continue to use
cars and their successors indefinitely. In densely populated areas, conventional buses and
trains will maintain their popularity, until the autodrive revolution in around 2060. Automated
vehicular and traffic control will merge the best properties of road and rail, creating a unified
system of roads with rail-like traffic flows. By 2080 VTOL aircraft will be sufficiently cheap,
safe, and easy to control that they will be as widely owned as recreational vehicles are in
2000. However, nuisance issues will restrict where they can land and takeoff, and safety will
require that they fly under at least semi-automated traffic control in busy flight corridors.
Continental. Air travel will continue to get cheaper and more efficient in the first decades
after 2000. By 2030 humans will apply supersonic and perhaps hypersonic travel to a few
more commercial intercontinental routes. Air traffic congestion around busy metropolitan
areas will be partly abated by automated traffic control but may ultimately require shifting
some of the passenger load to long-range high-speed subsonic trains. Ships will continue to
handle bulk transport without major changes such as heavy use of of hydrofoils or hovercraft.
Space. Space propulsion will eventually transition from chemical and ion to fusion and
eventually antimatter.
Energy
Sources. Fossil fuels will continue to provide the bulk of humanity's power through at least
2150. Solar energy will continue to provide humanity's food (through photosynthesis) as well
as a limited part of its power (through water and small amounts of wind, wave, and
photovoltaics). Geothermal and fission energy will not supply major parts of humanity's
power, but by 2150 thermonuclear fusion will.
Applications. Plugged devices will continue indefinitely to be powered by electricity delivered
as alternating current over a power grid that may eventually start taking advantage of
superconductivity. Unplugged devices will continue to be powered by chemical batteries that
will be the limiting technology for more and more applications. Heating devices will continue
to be powered by a combination of fossil fuels and electricity. Internal combustion in vehicles
will be supplemented by batteries and flywheels before being replaced by hydrogen fuel cells
around 2075. Energy storage through anti-matter containment will by 2300 be feasible for
space propulsion and military explosives. Safe and efficient anti-matter batteries would be as
revolutionary as chemical batteries have been, but may not be practical before 2500.
Government
Communication technology and free market practice will continue to make government more
open and more subject to competitive pressure. Electoral procedures will be modernized
towards preference ballots, in which voters rank candidates and in successive rounds of
ballot-counting the weakest candidate's votes are redistributed until a candidate achieves a
majority. Government will increasingly use market-based mechanisms such as vouchers,
negative taxes, or outright privitization. Communications technology will promote less corrupt
and more open practices in both politics and government.
Military
Strategic warfare. Ballistic and cruise missiles will continue to be easier and cheaper to
attack with than to defend against. Thus nuclear missiles will continue indefinitely to be
humanity's premier technology for strategic warfare. (Other technologies of mass destruction
are more suited to unconventional warfare.) Nuclear weaponry may ultimately be replaced by
antimatter warheads only if antimatter generation and containment technology becomes
effective.
Conventional warfare. Fear of nuclear warfare will continue to make conventional warfare
an important capability. As it has since Pearl Harbor, conventional warfare will continue to be
dominated by the ability of air power to find and strike surface targets (and also to move and
supply ground forces). For reasons of miniaturization, agility, and pilot risk, combat aircraft will
by 2060 tend to be remotely piloted (unless transmission of aircraft sensor data makes those
aircraft much easier to target). Against opponents without competitive submarine power, sea
warfare will continue to be dominated by aircraft carriers. Unless boutique anti-submarine and
anti-missile technology can stay ahead of budget submarine and missile technology, aircraft
carriers will by 2100 be replaced by submarines carrying aerial weapons systems. Land
warfare will continue to be dominated by sensor and guidance technology, especially as all
battlefield sensing and intelligence becomes integrated and distributed. Although camouflage,
first sight, and first shot will increase in tactical importance, the hard-to-hide and easy-to-hit
main battle tank will nevertheless enjoy at least several more decades of battlefield
preeminence, thanks to its superior mobility and fire control. Orbital platforms will become
increasingly important for communications and surveillance, even as they become more
vulnerable to anti-satellite weaponry. This vulnerability will be offset somewhat by the
stealthiness and redundancy enabled by miniaturization and lower launching costs.
Unconventional warfare. Fortunately, guerrilla and terrorist warfare will diminish as more
and more of humanity enjoys liberty and prosperity. Unfortunately, the weapons available to
terrorists will become more and more destructive. Terrorists will increasingly make use of
chemical weapons, and will also attempt to create man-made catastrophes. Except possibly
for denial-of-service attacks, "information warfare" will by 2020 be useful only against
primitive systems that haven't yet taken advantage of modern security techniques.
Ultimate warfare. At the limit, military technology will plateau at two abilities: to gather and
use information about enemy plans and actions, and to collect and deploy energy used to
disrupt and destroy the enemy's war-making capability. By 2300 humanity will have mastered
the fundamentals of nanotechnology and energy storage using anti-matter. At that time, even
the most advanced alien aggressor might not really have a qualitative advantage in
fundamental technology, but rather a (potentially overwhelming) quantitative advantage in its
ability to deploy sensors, warheads, and nanobots. "Information warfare" will not be a
significant weapon between separate and hostile civilizations, as information is too easy to
secure when there is zero desire for communication and cooperation.
Education
Teaching. Communication and information technology will supplement human teachers and
make them more productive, but they will remain essential for educating children. 
Technology, the shortening workweek, and public policy innovation will make home schooling
more common. As information resources grow in richness and as technology makes careers
more dynamic, undergraduate education will increasingly focus on learning to learn.
Undergraduate and continuing education will be transformed significantly by technology, but
graduate research will continue to be like apprenticeship.
Knowing. Technology change and information growth will make meta-knowledge
increasingly important: knowing what to know, knowing what one does and does not know,
knowing what one can and cannot know, knowing how to find and evaluate knowledge, and
knowing how to express, store, and classify knowledge. Meta-knowledge will allow humans
to take increasing advantage of information and communication devices and prostheses.
However, direct downloading of knowledge will remain almost impossible without a detailed
and thorough understanding of mental architecture that is likely to differ subtly but significantly
from person to person.
Health Care
Delivery. Telemedicine will become more common, but health care delivery will continue to
be provided mainly by physicians working in clinics and hospitals.
Diseases. The incidence of genetic diseases will slowly but steadily be minimized in the next
few centuries by genetic screening and engineering. Treatments for the major infectious,
immunological and cancerous diseases will be developed through several more centuries of
continued research. Curing the major neurological and aging-related diseases will take much
of the coming millennium. Obesity and other nutritional diseases will be cured in the next two
centuries by advances in pharmacology and in artificial foods. More and more forms of injury
will be made non-lethal through surgery and repairable through transplants and prosthetics.
Longevity. Humans will increase their longevity by finding ways to preserve the body, the
brain, and the mind. Expected and maximum human longevity will increase by at least thirty
years by 2100. Will humans find a way to keep the body or at least the brain
alive indefinitely?
Manufacturing
Robotics will continuously increase in importance in manufacturing. Automation will make
hardware design and manufacturing increasingly like software design and manufacturing.
That is, absolute manufacturing costs will continuously drop, but design and development will
remain relatively costly even while becoming absolutely more productive. Ultimately, the cost
of material goods will be the amortized cost of specifying and designing them plus only the
marginal energy required to manufacture and deliver them.
Merchandising
Disintermediation is the removal of intermediaries (such as retailers, sales agents, and
brokers) from transactions between suppliers and consumers armed with information to which
formerly only the intermediary had access. Disintermediation driven by information and
communication technology will continue to make transactions cheaper and markets more
efficient and pricing more competitive. Intermediaries will continue to disappear in markets
where they enjoyed quasi-exclusive access to information (initially travel, auto retail) or where
they retail fungible items that can be well-described through telepresence (initially books,
music, electronics). Fixed pricing will increasingly give way to auctions and reverse auctions.
Suppliers will continue to cut design and inventory costs by allowing consumers to directly
specify what they want produced by the suppliers' automated plants.
Brokering
Disintermediation will continue to revolutionize or obsolete conventional practice in most
brokerage markets. However, the markets themselves for money, equity, commodities, risk
(insurance), and space (real estate) will operate indefinitely, joined by markets for
natural-resource consumption and pollution.
Services
Most service occupations that can be automated without artificial intelligence or mobile
robotics have already been automated. Exceptions are some service occupations in
industries like transportation and media, which will be automated in the coming decades
using sophisticated (but not truly intelligent) information processing technology.
5.7.6. Social Science / Futurology / Sociopolitical Developments
Sociopolitical Developments: the trends and changes in how humans behave.
Economic Developments
Human standards of living will continue to rise indefinitely because human productivity will
continue to rise indefinitely. Productivity is a function of per-worker physical capital
(investment), per-worker human capital (education), and capital efficiency (innovation). By
2300 most of humanity will approach the per-worker levels of education and physical capital
of the original industrialized nations. Capital efficiency will continue to rise due to
technological and industrial developments. The ultimate limit to terrestrial productivity and
living standards will be heat pollution.
Economic globalization will continue as the developing world industrializes. By 2100 most of
humanity will be using a common currency descended from the American dollar. Inflation will
continue to be held to frictional levels of 1% to 3%, while real interest rates will remain
indefinitely around 3%.
The workweek will continue to shorten until around 2300 when it reaches about 20 hours,
where it will plateau due to psychological factors similar to those that fix humans' daily
transportation budget between 1 to 3 hours. Retirement age will continue to decrease on
average while retirement itself becomes less clearly delineated. Careers will fade gradually
into lengthy semi-retirements that include sabbaticals, avocational employment, and portfolio
management. The share of personal income derived from investments will rise compared to
that derived from wages. Increases in wealth and automation will minimize the need for labor
but never eliminate the need for work. Rather, work will increasingly consist of analyzing and
deciding what is to be made or done and how machines can make or do it.
How will the savings and discount rates be affected by increasing
longevity? Why are the returns to capital less than its estimated 30%
share of all production?
Political Developments
Since the Renaissance the natural trend toward political and economic liberty has been
resisted by three kinds of forces:
● tyranny, whether monarchic, autocratic, plutocratic, or ethnic;
● economic securitarianism, manifested as socialism and communism; and
● moral securitarianism, driven by fideist religion.
The era of liberation that erupted in 1989 will by 2040 have eliminated almost all overt
tyranny. The major exception will be entrenched and sometimes subtle ethnic tyrannies that
will linger for decades until asphyxiated by economic development and modernized
communications. Socialism and communism having been discredited, economic
securitarianism will linger (perhaps indefinitely) only as the sustaining sentiment behind
welfare statism. The moral securitarianism motivated by fideist religion will remain the most
serious global obstacle to human liberty, and will not fade as a political force until perhaps
2100.
Global government will emerge slowly over the next few hundred years, as global regulatory
bodies are set up to handle more and more government functions. Thus global government
will emerge not necessarily from the UN and EU but from organizations like ISO and WTO.
Only by around 2500 will there be a truly global federal government with sovereign (but
limited) legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Any extra-planetary colonies will be
federated into the global government no differently than terrestrial political units. Only the
communications latency of interstellar colonization would create the need for sovereignties
independent of Earth's.
Private property and relatively free markets will endure indefinitely. Absolute poverty will
continue to diminish as per-capita productivity continues to rise. Institutional relative poverty
will continue in the absence of social policies to discourage dependency and encourage
private accumulation of human and financial capital. Digital reproduction and distribution of
copyrighted expressions will become increasingly rampant and could only be deterred
through Gestapo-style inspections of digital watermarks. As a result, copyright will by 2040 be
redefined to limit only commercial competition with the owner and abuses of attribution.
Purchasing of copyrighted expression will be replaced by voluntary micropayments (of money
or attention) made directly to copyright owners.
Packet-switched communication technology will affect politics only in limited ways. Voters will
have almost unlimited access to information about candidates' positions, but unfortunately will
remain too complacent to use that access effectively. There will be calls to let voters use
regular electronic referenda to enact or at least veto legislation. Fortunately, it will be
recognized that the electorate remains too uninformed and impulsive to allow this dangerous
form of mob rule.
Enfranchisement of fetuses will gradually cease to be a hot issue in America because birth
control by 2100 will have drastically reduced the incidence of abortion. Future-phobes will
continue to oppose every advance in biotechnology, but in the end their opposition will
succeed only when an advance threatens health or property and doesn't just offend their
moral sensibilities. Human consumption of meat and dairy will not be outlawed in the long
term, as animal rights will not be extended beyond freedom from torture and extinction. These
animal rights will be recognized in machines when by 2200 they exhibit convincing affect and
possess artifactual life. Around the same time, such machines will be recognized as persons
if they exhibit artificial intelligence.
Vice. Electronic gambling and pornography will become available to any adult who wants
them, and adult access to prostitution will continue to expand. Most psychotropics will be
legalized by 2150, especially as neurochemistry becomes more able to manage the problems
of addiction and withdrawal. Tobacco and alcohol will remain legal. Firearms licensing will
become increasingly strict, but even handguns will remain legal for some people to own.
Sociological Developments
Humans will indefinitely remain pair-bonded and omnivorous. The number of native human
languages will continue to decline drastically as smaller societies become linguistically
absorbed into larger ones. English will become increasingly widespread, especially as a
second language. Its status as the global second language will enable it to become the native
language of a majority of humans by 2600, and of 90% of humans by 3000. A parallel
process of increasing intermarriage will significantly blur racial and ethnic distinctions.
When by around 2300 the rest of humanity has closed the development gap with the
industrialized world, Earth's population will stabilize near 20 billion. Increasing longevity will
result in an average age decades older than ever before. Any progress toward indefinite
longevity will, as is typical of increases in living standards, probably decrease the birth rate.
The long-term population of the Earth will be limited primarily by heat pollution.
Genetic engineering will increasing allow parents to screen and tune the traits of their
children. Sale of gametes and surrogacy services will become more widely accepted. Cloning
will mainly be used for reasons of sentimentality and reproductive difficulty. Eugenics will
never be a mandatory social policy, but widespread voluntary genetic engineering will have a
similar effect.
Religion will decline due to the ongoing loss of faith. Christianity will be hollowed out and
diluted into a bland mysticism. Islam will follow along the same track but about 150 years
behind. Being already more mystical, Hinduism and especially Buddhism will linger as
phenomena more ethnocultural than religious, much like Judaism and Shintoism already are.
5.7.7. Social Science / Futurology / Challenges
Environmental Challenges
Global Warming. Accumulation of greenhouse gases is causing a rise in global temperature
of a few degrees celsius. This may by 2050 melt enough antarctic ice to raise sea levels by a
few feet and cause some coastal flooding. Warming may make weather cycles more extreme
but may also make land more useful in the northern expanses of Asia and North America.
Projected greenhouse warming is not severe enough to lead to runaway effects like on
Venus.
Heat Pollution. Over the next millennium and for the rest of human history, earth's major
environmental problem will be warming due not to greenhouse gases but rather to increased
waste heat from non-solar energy (initially petrochemical, but then fusion). The problem
emerges when a world population in the high tens or low hundreds of billions all enjoy an
energy budget equivalent to the industrialized West in 2000. All the waste heat from all the
energy uses adds up, and the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that energy use always
creates heat exhaust. Heat pollution will have to be managed to prevent a runaway
greenhouse effect like on Venus.
Population. The primary long-term environmental problems caused by human population
increase will be heat pollution and pressure on habitats and ecosystems. By contrast, the
traditional environmental worries of pollution and resource scarcity are subject to
increasingly-effective technological and economic solutions. As Earth's population stabilizes,
some will worry that decreasing birth rates will lead to declining population. Any actual
decreases in population will be minor and temporary, and underpopulation will never be a
long-term problem.
Some ignorant humans fear that "inferior" races are outbreeding their own race. Others fear
that decreased reproduction among humans with high incomes or IQs will mean that
humanity will be overrun by the poor or the stupid. These fearful humans fail to understand
that environment and culture are more important than genes, and that human evolution long
ago changed from biological to cultural and will soon change to biotechnological.
Resource Scarcity. The scarcity of a resource is measured by the cost of satisfying the need
that it satisfies. By this measure, almost all resources have throughout human history been
getting less and less scarce. Fossil fuels will remain abundant at least through 2050, and will
likely not be very scarce before fusion replaces them as humanity's primary energy source
starting around 2150. Arable soil will through conservation remain abundant, and minerals will
continue to decrease in scarcity (i.e. cost). Many species of fish and game will become
increasingly less abundant in the wild, but the cost/scarcity of food in general will continue to
decline. Demand for fresh water will outpace most of its natural supply, but the cost of fresh
water will eventually plateau at and decline with the energy cost of its desalinization and
transportation.
Biodiversity. While food will continue becoming less scarce, the wild plants and animals that
constitute earth's ecosystem will come under increasing pressure from humanity's increasing
population. Loss of forest and wetlands will threaten fragile ecosystems that harbor rare
species. The lost information content of extincted species is effectively impossible to replace.
Pollution. Pollution levels in humanity's air, water, and land will continue to decrease as
per-capita income increases and as government requires that economic transactions
internalize their polluting externalities. Earth's crust has sufficient volume that solid waste
disposal will be simply a problem of transportation. Human population will be limited much
more by heat pollution much than by solid waste pollution. Property interests will ensure that
soil erosion is mitigated. Government will successfully prevent destruction of the ozone layer.
Infectious Disease. Pathogens will continue their natural evolutionary race against
humanity's immunological and pharmacological defenses. Further progress against some
pathogens may be frustratingly slow, but genetic engineering will by 2300 make most
infectious diseases subject to treatment and many subject even to prevention.

Political Challenges

Populism. As industrial capitalism becomes mature and ubiquitous, humanity will continue to face the popular temptation to redistribute unequal wealth and income or at least regulate association between economically unequal parties. Protectionism will be less of a problem, as governing elites increasingly recognize the utility of free markets, and as the world economy becomes increasingly integrated.

Neophobia. Humans who misunderstand the interplay of economics, ecology, and
technology will continue for centuries to oppose technological progress and economic
development. Opposition to techno-economic development will continue to be motivated by
● a simplistic and mystical reverence for the environment in its present or recent state,
● a misunderstanding of what is and isn't natural, and
● a general fear of what anything new and hard to understand.
Opposition based on religious faith will grow weaker after trying to stifle biomedical advances
like genetic engineering and cloning.
Moral Securitarianism.As fideist religions continue to weaken, their remaining adherents will
react with increasing fundamentalism. They will agitate for legal prohibitions against
victimless behaviors and technologies that they believe have been banned by their
non-existent gods. Except for temporary victories, their agitations will ultimately fail.
Ethnic Conflict.Nationalism and freedom will continue to be the dominant political forces at
least until global economic convergence occurs by around 2300. Ethnic conflicts will continue
to erupt throughout the 21st century, but they will be increasingly mitigated by political,
economic, and communications globalization.
Terrorism. Terrorism will decline with the weakening of ethnic repression and fideist
religions. Terrorism by neophobes may continue indefinitely. Ambitious terrorists will attempt
to use chemical, biological, cyberactive, and nuclear weapons.
Discrimination. Overt discrimination will abate sharply as societies modernize their
communications and converge economically with the industrialized West. America is an
example of how much progress can happen in only two generations. The ultimate test for the
elimination of discrimination is intermarriage. Intermarriage and the end of discrimination will
cause each other, but the process will take most of the third millennium.
Cyberspace. Communications technology will dramatically undermine jurisdictional and
repressive aspects of political authority. Certain jurisdictions will for nationalistic, religious, or
neophobic reasons attempt to control how cyberspace affects them. These attempts will be
disruptive but will ultimately fail. Repression will decline and political institutions will federate
and globalize, but the institution of spatially-defined political sovereignty will continue.
Vice. Human temperance will be increasingly and perhaps severely tested by new
technologies. Video games will evolve into virtual reality systems that command as much of
some humans' time as do sleep and work. VR will allow perverts and psychopaths to commit
virtual crimes that are unspeakable, lifelike, and completely victimless. Neurochemistry will
allow the use of psychotropics without problems of addiction and withdrawal. Fideists and
neophobes will cite these new technologies as evidence that progress is bad.
Forgery. With digital photography, images will be considered increasingly unreliable as
evidence in courts. By 2040, sound and video too will be easy enough to forge that their
authenticity will be open to question. Digital certificate techniques will be able to ameliorate
these problems only in very limited ways.
Privacy. Privacy will be affected by technology in two ways. First, information processing
technology will allow businesses to track customer interactions to arbitrary levels of detail.
Customers who consider this a problem will seek businesses offering privacy guarantees, or
will patronize intermediation services that offer to protect their identity. Public-key
cryptography will always allow secure and private communication and e-commerce even if
network traffic can be intercepted.
Second and more disturbing, miniaturization of sensor and storage technology will allow
anyone to set up hidden audiovideo surveillance of almost any location to which they ever
have physical access. By 2050, this will include locations that can be reached by
remote-controlled insect-sized flying sensors. Sensors will use storage technology to avoid
the need for the radio emissions that in the past made it possible to "sweep" for bugs. Privacy
will only be assured in clean rooms that can be inspected and monitored for intrusion.
5.7.8. Social Science / Futurology / Possible Catastrophes
Natural Catastrophes
Earthquake. Earthquakes and floods will through 2300 still occasionally kill tens of thousands
of humans in developing societies. Of even greater historical consequence would be a
possible massive earthquake in Tokyo, San Francisco, or Los Angeles. Such a quake could
cause on the order of a trillion dollars in damage and could trigger a worldwide depression. In
the worst case this would set back human progress by perhaps a decade.
Pandemic. How much of humanity could be killed in the future by a naturally-arising
pathogen? In the 1500s and 1600s, European epidemics killed perhaps 90% of the aboriginal
Americans. In the 1400s, the plague killed one third of the humans in Europe. The worldwide
influenza of 1918 killed 30 million, and AIDS had killed at least half that by 2000. It seems
unlikely that a natural pathogen could kill more than a small fraction of humanity, especially
given modern sanitation. Evolutionary pressures tend to make pathogens less virulent over
time, and newly-arising pathogens rarely seem to extinct their host species even in their initial
outbreak. Genetically-engineered pathogens may be different.
Alien Aggression. The arrival of extraterrestrial intelligence on Earth might seem to pose a
threat to human civilization. The arrival of Homo sapiens sapiens in Europe heralded the end
of Homo sapiens neanderthalensis. The arrival of Home sapiens in Australia and the
Americas quickly led to the extinction of most of the native megafauna. Contact with farming
civilization has almost invariably led to the decline or assimilation of hunter-gatherer cultures.
Contact with industrial civilization has almost invariably caused severe disruption in
pre-industrial civilizations.
Fortunately, ETI would be unlikely to colonize Earth. Biochemical differences would surely
render Earth life inedible to any ETI that had not yet become machine-based. As modern
economic experience shows, raw human labor is too easy to automate to make enslavement
worthwhile. Earth has deuterium-rich oceans of water, but even more water is available on
Europa, which is also not as deep in the Sun's gravity well. Except for its reactive oxygen
atmosphere, Earth's climate is relatively benign and might be an attractive place to establish
an ETI population. However, space faring ETI would probably value Earth more for studying
than for exploiting. Space faring ETI could just as easily satisfy its resource needs using the
uninhabited parts of the solar system. Note that an alien Von Neumann probe could pose a
variant of the robot aggression or nanoplague catastrophes.
Interplanetary Impact. The impact on Earth of an asteroid or comet only a few miles across
would have devastating blast, tidal wave, incendiary, and smoke effects. In particular, the
global pall of smoke raised by such an impact could block enough sunlight to effectively
cancel one or two agricultural seasons and starve billions of humans to death. Such a
catastrophe would set back human progress by one or two centuries. With five or ten year's
warning, humanity could mount a mission to prevent such an impact by adjusting the
impacter's orbit. The probability of such an impact is extremely low, only happening every few
hundred thousand years. Less probable by far is impact with or orbital disruption by a small
black hole that might wander through the Solar system. Impact with a black hole would
effectively destroy the surface of the earth and most or all life on it. Disruption of the Earth's
orbit could cause a biosphere-destroying runaway greenhouse effect like on Venus. Even a
slight increase in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit would cause ecological disruptions that
would probably starve billions of humans. Ejection of Earth from the Solar system would in a
matter of months freeze to death all terrestrial life (except perhaps ecosystems around
volcanic vents at the bottoms of frozen oceans). Humanity will not be safe from such an event
until its first self-sustaining extraplanetary colonies are created around 3000.
Supernova. A supernova would have to be within a few tens of light years of Earth for its
radiation to endanger creatures living at the bottom of Earth's atmosphere. No stars that close
to Earth will go supernova in the next few million years.
Ice Age. When Earth's next ice age arrives in 10,000 years or so, it will grant slight but
welcome relief from the problem of heat pollution.
Magnetic Field Reversal. Earth's magnetic field reverses polarity every few hundred
thousand years, and is almost non-existent for perhaps a century during the transition. The
last reversal was 780 Kya, and the magnetic field's strength decreased 5% during the 20th
century. During the next reversal the ozone layer will be unprotected from charged solar
particles that could weaken its ability to protect humans from ultraviolet radiation. However,
past reversals are not associated with any changes or extinctions in the fossil record, and the
next reversal will not likely affect humanity in a catastrophic way.
Man-made Catastrophes
Nuclear Catastrophe. Nuclear power could result in three kinds of catastrophe: radioactive
pollution, limited nuclear bombing, and general nuclear war. Accidental or deliberate
radioactive pollution could kill tens or hundreds of thousands, but is quite unlikely to happen.
Regional nuclear conflict in the Middle East or the Indian subcontinent could kill several
million. Nuclear terrorism against Washington D.C. or New York City could kill more than a
million and set back human progress by up to a decade. General nuclear war would kill
hundreds of millions and could trigger a nuclear winter that might starve hundreds of millions
more. While such a worst case would set back human progress by one or two centuries,
existing nuclear arsenals could neither extinct humanity nor end human civilization.
Cultural Decline. Some humans fear that vice, crime, and corruption indicate ongoing social
decline or impending collapse. Other humans fear that problems of class division, pollution,
education, and infrastructure indicate economic decline or impending collapse. These fears
are perennial and unfounded. Past examples of the drastic decline or collapse of a culture or
civilization have almost always been due to environmental change, or infection or invasion by
outside humans. But after the advent of continental steam locomotion in the mid-1800s, no
society remains unexposed to the infections of the others. Similarly, all societies have been
made part of a single global human civilization which is not subject to invasion by outside
humans. Environmental change indeed poses a set of challenges, but they seem to represent
constraints on growth rather than seeds of collapse.
Cultural stagnation is another possible (but milder) kind of potential catastrophe. As in Ming
China, Middle Ages Europe, or the Soviet Bloc, stagnation can result if a static ideology takes
hold and suppresses dissent. Such a development seems unlikely, given the intellectual
freedom and communication technology of the modern world. Ideologies with totalitarian
potential include fideist religions, communism, and ecological primitivism.
Bioterrorism. Could a pathogen be genetically designed to be virulent
enough to extinct humanity? A pathogen would have to be designed to spread easily
from person to person, persist in the environment, resist antibiotics and immune responses,
and cause almost 100% mortality. Designing for long latency (e.g. months) might be
necessary to ensure wide distribution, but no length may be enough to infect every last
human.
Robot Aggression. Some humans fear that the combination of robotics and artificial
intelligence will in effect create a new dominant species that will not tolerate human control or
even resource competition. These fears are misplaced. Artificial intelligence will be developed
gradually by about 2200, and will not evolve runaway super-intelligence. Even when AI is
integrated with artifactual life by the early 2200s, the time and energy constraints on
artifactual persons will render them no more capable of global domination than any particular
variety of humans (i.e. natural persons). Similarly, humanity's first Von Neumann probes will
be incapable of overwhelming Earth's defenses even if they tried. To be truly dangerous, VN
probes would have to be of a species with both true intelligence and a significant military
advantage over humanity. Such a species would be unlikely to engage in alien aggression.
Nanoplague. Self-replicating nanotechnology could in theory become a cancer to the Earth's
biosphere, replacing all ribonucleic life with nanotech life. The primary limit on the expansion
of such nanotech life would, as for all life, be the availability of usable energy and material.
Since any organic material would presumably be usable, the primary limit on how nanocancer
could consume organic life would be the availability of usable energy. Fossil fuels are not
sufficiently omnipresent, and fusion is not sufficiently portable, so nanocancer would, like
ribonucleic microorganisms, have to feed on sunlight or organic tissues. Ribonucleic
photosynthesis captures a maximum of about 10% of incident solar energy, while nanocancer
should be able to capture at least 50%. The only way to stop nanocancer would be to cut off
its access to energy and material or interfere with its mechanisms for using them.
