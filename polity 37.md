polity class 37

class started with a brief discussion of previous class (1.05 pm)

model code of conduct (mcc) (1.09 pm)

mcc is a set of norms for conduct & behavior on part of parties & candidates, in particular. mcc for guidance of political parties & candidates is a small but unique document.
elements of mcc
1) behavior
2) public processions
3. polling day
4) use of govt. machinery
implications of applying model code of conduct
present code contains guidelines for general conduct of political parties & candidates (no attack on private life, no appeal to communal feelings, discipline & decorum in meetings, processions, guidelines for party in power – official machinery & facilities not to be used for electioneering, prohibition against ministers & other authorities in announcing grants, new schemes, etc).
ministers & those holding public offices are not allowed to combine official visits with electioneering tours.
issue of advertisements at cost of public exchequer is prohibited.
grants, new schemes/projects cannot be announced. even schemes that may have been announced before mcc came into force, but that have not actually taken off in terms of implementation on field are also required to be put on hold.
it's through such restrictions that advantage of being in power is blunted & contestants get opportunity to fight on more or less equal terms.
rational behind mcc:
moral pressure
media & public attention toward actions of govt.
enforcement of mcc:
mcc has got judicial recognition of highest court of land.
dispute over date when model code of conduct should come into force, issuance of press release by ec announcing poll dates, or date of actual notification in this regard was resolved in union of india v/s harbans sigh jalal.
apex court gave ruling that code of conduct would come into force moment commission issues press release, which precedes notification by a good 2 weeks.
this ruling lay at rest controversy related to dates of enforcement of mcc.
thus mcc remains in force from date of announcement of elections till completion of elections.
contemporary challenges in implementing model code of conduct
emergence of new forms of electoral malpractices like manipulation through media is difficult to trace to specific political parties & candidates.
weakened capacity of eci to respond to violations of mcc in form of weak or delayed response.
use of third-party contracts for disseminating most of election-related information to
avoid legal responsibility.
flouting self-regulatory social media code evolved by eci.
misuse of narrative by ruling party over sensitive issues such as national security, disaster management, etc, that eci observes, do not fall under ambit of mcc.

should mcc be given legal status? (1.32 pm)

parliamentary standing committee on law & justice recommended in its 2013 report that statutory status is accorded to mcc.
1) committee held that most of provisions of mcc are already contained in various laws & are therefore enforceable like violation of secrecy of voting, causing enmity among communities, prohibition of public meetings 48 hours prior to the
conclusion of polls.
2)committee also observed that eci strictly enforces provisions of mcc which are relatable to other statutes enacted by parliament or otherwise.
3) since election commission claims to have powers to punish political parties through plenary power under article 324 of constitution, committee recommended enacting law for giving statutory back up to mcc leaving no vacuum for eci to exercise its power which is residuary in nature.
4) it suggested that instructions/orders issued by election commission of india under article 324 of constitution sometimes encroach upon legislative power of parliament.
arguments against legal status to mcc:
1) decision-making power will go to judiciary & thus swiftness, expedition, & promptness in dealing with cases of violation of mcc will be gone.
2) if mcc is converted into a law, this would mean that a complaint would lie to police/magistrate. 
3) legal codification of these norms would be a potential nightmare, exposing entire electoral process to needless litigation. broad objectives of mcc are best achieved by oversight of impartial election watchdog.
4) election commission itself is of view that although statutory back up to code may make it more effective & strengthen its binding nature, it may complicate implementation of code in middle of elections.

exit survey/ opinion polls(1.37 pm)

please cover same from hand-outs

comparison of indian constitution with other countries (1.43 pm)

british constitution
1) unwritten
2) british constitution is a specimen of evolutionary development.
3) british constitution is a classic ex of a flexible constitution. it can be passed,
amended & repealed by a simple majority
4) unlike india & usa, there are no judicial review powers 
5) british constitution has a unitary character as opposed to a federal one.
6) britain has a parliamentary form of govt. king, who is sovereign, has been deprived of all his powers & authority.
7) a very important feature of british constitution is sovereignty of british parliament (a written constitution being absent).
though in india’s case, we have legislature at state level too, yet law-making power of indian parliament roughly corresponds to that of british parliament.
8) rule of law
9) independence of judiciary

comparison of diff organs of state (1.50 pm)

1) executive
shadow cabinet
position of prime minister
permanent civil servants/british bureaucrats student notes:
indian bureaucracy is modeled on british bureaucracy.
2) legislature
there is a natural tendency to compare parliament of india with british parliament.
but our parliament & parliamentary institutions & procedures are not a copy of westminster system.
there are fundamental differences b/w 2 systems.
british parliament has grown through some 3 hundred years of history. in britain, parliament can say to be only institution, which exercises sovereign powers & on which there are no limits because there is no written constitution.
india, on other hand, has a written constitution. powers & authorities of every organ of govt & every functionary are only as defined & delimited by constitutional document. power of parliament itself is also clearly defined & delimited by constitution.
however, within its own sphere, parliament is supreme.
house of lords is 2nd chamber, or upper house, of united kingdom's bi-cameral (two-chamber) parliament. house of lords has hereditary members.
moreover, it has largest number of life peers, church/religious peers (ecclesiastical peers), & law lords.
together with house of commons & crown, house of lords form uk’s parliament.
speaker of lok sabha in india
though position of speaker of lok sabha in india is midway b/w british & us model, it's theoretically closer to british model. but similar conventions do not exist. for instance:
it's not necessary for speaker to resign from his party
if he/she decides to resign, he/she will not be disqualified under anti-defection law.
there is no convention in india that he/she will be elected uncontested.
3) judiciary
under doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, judiciary lacks intrinsic power to strike down act of parliament. however, subordination of common law to statute law does not mean subordination of judiciary to executive. courts in britain retain certain powers:
of interpreting precise meaning of a statute.
of reviewing actions of ministers & other public officials by applying doctrine of ultra vires (beyond powers).
of applying concept of natural justice to actions of ministers & others.
because parliament is sovereign, govt can seek to overturn decisions of courts bypassing amendment legislation.
power of judicial review provides judiciary
with a potentially significant role in policy process.
comparison b/w indian & british judiciary (2.06 pm)
similarities
actions of executive can be declared ultra vires in both systems.
judiciary is considered highest interpreter of constitution.
off late, there has been a splurge in judicial activism in britain & judiciary is becoming more & more
differences
in case of british system, lack of concept of ‘basic structure’ makes amending power of parliament supersedes any judicial pronouncement.
whereas, in case of indian judiciary system, concept of ‘basic structure’ has provided a potent tool to judiciary by which it can scuttle down any executive or legislative action, which it deems as against basic spirit of constitution.
british legal system is completely based on ‘common law system’.
common-law system implies that law is developed by judges through their decisions, orders, or judgments (also referred to as precedents).
however, unlike british system, which is entirely based on common law system, where it had originated from, indian system incorporates common law system along with statutory & regulatory laws.

constitution of united states of america (2.10 pm)

while american constitution is shortest (of any major govt in world) & 1st written constitution, india’s constitution is lengthiest written constitution in world.
american constitution is a very rigid constitution consisting of only seven articles & twenty-seven amendments, so far.
originally, indian constitution consisted of 395 articles in 22 parts, with 8 schedules. as of january 2020, it consists of 470 articles in 25 parts, 12 schedules, & 5 appendices.
american constitution is described as a truly federal constitution.
it was ratified by 50 independent states.
further, federal govt & states have their own constitutions & do not interfere in each other’s functions.
on other hand, india has only 1 constitution, wherein central govt interferes with functions of state govts
nature of federalism
while usa is a dual federation, india is a cooperative federation.
form of govt
america has adopted a presidential form of govt, in which people directly elect executive president.
india has adopted a parliamentary form of govt.
president
position of american president combines both head of state & head of govt into one.
only a natural-born citizen of usa can become president, & not a person who has acquired citizenship.
also, he must have attained age of 35 years & must have stayed in usa for at least 14 years.
on other hand, indian president should be a citizen of india, wherein citizenship might be either natural or acquired.
committee system in usa
usa has strongest committee system in world. it's said that us congress works in committees.
difference from british & indian system:
in britain & india, a bill is introduced in house & 1st reading takes place, & then it's referred to committee
in usa, a bill is introduced & then directly referred to committee, before even 1st reading.
amendment of constitution
there are 2 ways to amend constitution:
proposed by congress & ratified by states
1) amendment to be passed by 2/3rd majority in both houses
2) to be ratified by state legislatures of at least 3/4th of states
proposed by states & ratified by states
1) 2/3rd of states should pass a resolution to this effect
2) they will communicate to congress. congress will call convention.
3) in convention, it has to be ratified by 3/4th of states
in case of india, amendment process is easy & flexible as compared to us.
in india, it's only parliament that can propose amendment to constitution & states do not have any role to play in this matter.

break (2.38 pm to 3.02 pm)

panchayati raj in india (3.10 pm)

history of panchayati raj in india
article 40 reads: “state shall take steps to organize village panchayats & endow them with
such power & authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of
self-govt.”
community development (cdp) projects were inaugurated in 1952 but could not achieve their full
potential in absence of effective institutions for people‘s participation. it encompassed almost all
activities of rural development which were to be implemented with help of village panchayats
along with participation of people.
a historic breakthrough in establishing panchayati raj was effected through report of the
balwantrai mehta committee in 1957 recommended: public participation in community works
should be organized through statutory representative bodies.

highlights of 73rd caa

compulsory provisions
organization of gram sabhas
creation of a three-tier panchayat system
direct elections
minimum age for contesting would be 21 years
indirection elections to post of chairman
reservation of seats for sc/sts in proportion to population
reservation for women
creation of secs
creation of sfcs
in event of dissolution, elections compulsorily within six months
voluntary provisions
voting rights to mps & mlas & in these bodies
reservation for backward classes
devolution of functions under xith schedule
giving pris financial powers
basic structure of act
article 243 a provides for constitution of gs
243 b talks about creation of panchayats at 3 levels
243c talks about composition of gps: states by law may provide for rep of members of ls & la , members or rs & lcs
243 d talks about reservation of seats in panchayats
243 e talks about duration of panchayats
243g talks about state govt endowing panchayats with such powers & authority as may be necessary for them to function as institutions of self-governance.
243 h talks about empowering a state legislature to make laws for imposing taxes by panchayats & provide them powers to tax. assign to panchayats such taxed & duties collected by state. provide for grant in aids to gps
243 i w.r.t sfc: recommendations on above matters plus measures needed to improve the
position of gps
243k for sec
significance of local self govt.
1) builds foundation from below
2) acts as a school of democracy
3) direct democracy becomes possible at this level
4) more durable & participative in character
positive outcomes of 73rd caa
1) pri has succeeded in creating another layer of govt & political representation at grass-roots level
2) with respect to mandatory provisions of constitution for panchayati raj, we have achieved almost 100% success.
3) we have as many as 2.5 lakh institutions of local self-governance elected in this country & to these bodies, we have elected some 3.2 million representatives and
4) women have entered public life in a big way.
issues with 73rd caa
1) no automatic transfer of powers to pris rather states have to transfer power
2) grossly inadequate devolution: many states have not taken effective steps to devolve 3fs to pris to enable them to discharge their constitutionally stipulated function.
3) no uniformity in allocation of functions across states
4) gs powers have not been defined properly anywhere.
5) independence of sec has come into question time & again
6) issues with respect to functioning of sfcs
7) decentralization of corruption
8) act doesn’t lay down role of bureaucracy: in some states, gram panchayats have been placed in a position of subordination: gram panchayat sarpanches have to spend extraordinary amount of time visiting block offices for funds and/or technical approval. these interactions with block staff /office distort role of sarpanchs as elected representatives.
further, it's imperative that pris have financial resources & manpower to match the
responsibilities entrusted to them. while sfcs have submitted their recommendations, not
many states have implemented these or taken steps to ensure pri‘s fiscal viability
problems of financing local bodies in india
1) taxes devolved to pris are inelastic in nature
2) there is also a reluctance on part of pris to impose taxes
3) pris generate only 5% of their finances through their own sources & are highly dependent on state govt for their functioning
4) limited borrowing powers
5) states such as kerala, ap, & karnataka have done well when it comes to finances & thus pris are more autonomous & function in a more effective manner.
6) states are not implementing recommendations of sfcs
arc ii recommendations on pris
replace word may in 243(g) with word shall
local legislators should not be made members of pris
set up lcs in all states to provide representation to members of pris
sec be appointed through a collegium system
sfc report & atr to be submitted in 6 months
abolish mplads & mlalads scheme
parastatal bodies should be closed down
pris should have right to recruit their own personnel & regulate their conditions of
service
states should adopt concept of ‘activity mapping’, wherein each state clearly delineates responsibilities & roles for diff tiers of govt in respect to subjects listed in schedule xi.
