## [[socialism]]
(13:15)
less oppression of weak by strong.
in domain of polity, economy.
why there was a rise?
post-french [[revolution]] 1789, peasants benefited  b/c of land redistribution, & bourgeoisie benefitted from political class.
 b/c poor workers did not have right to vote, which was linked to income criterion. 
this feeling resulted in rise of jacobins. 
therefore early socialists desired early [[socialism]] & a decrease in oppression.
industrial [[revolution]] led to industrial [[capitalism]] & given ideology of laissez-faire, there was no protection for working class. 
karl marx observed industrial britain & gave communist manifesto.
in communist manifesto he asked workers to unite & overthrow [[capitalism]].
later in [[1876]], he published a huge number of [[book]]s in form of das kapital, which was economic critique of [[capitalism]]. 
modern usage of term [[socialism]]: 
usually a non-communist socialist.
this also means non-marxist socialist.  
is marx a socialist? yes.
is mao a socialist? yes. 
is maoism a marxist? yes but not 100% marxist as he also advocated peasant [[revolution]] too.

## marxism/scientific [[socialism]]/[[communism]]
(13:44)
anti-[[capitalism]]: wanted overthrow of [[capitalism]], & believed in inevitably of [[socialism]], & of end of [[capitalism]]. 
this is because: 
	feudalism could not survive  b/c it was exploitative of masses. & gave [[power]] to minority elites. 
	similarly, [[capitalism]] gives [[power]] to minority capitalists. & results in exploitation of masses, i.e. workers.  therefore will be overthrown. 

## ownership of means of [[production]]
(14:01)
owner of means of [[production]] is a capitalist.
while actual producer of value in [[society]] is worker. 
therefore, decision-making [[power]] over [[production]] process is not with workers. 
puls, distribution of surplus (profits), is decided by a capitalist.
workers get wages, in return for producing value, while capitalists make profits.
profits of capitalists are inversely proportional to wages of workers. 
and primary motive of capitalists for [[production]] is profit motive.
therefore, interests of capitalists are against interests of working-class/workers. 
therefore workers under [[capitalism]] lose their autonomy & control over value they produce. 
and they also lose their monetary dues since wages are far less than value produced. 
as per marx, [[capitalism]] has led to disharmony & conflict in [[society]]:
to begin with, there is harmony as it's natural for people to come together for joint [[production]]. 
but introduction of [[capitalism]], (i.e. profit motive & private ownership of means of [[production]].) gives birth to conflict, & [[society]] gets divided into classes, leading to class conflict in [[society]]. 
therefore marx desired a classless [[society]] by ending capitalist class.
marx wanted to replace private ownership with collective ownership of community, i.e. decentralization of [[power]] in hands of community.  
marx was pro-industrialization as he wanted abundance of goods in [[society]]. 
he was anti-industrial [[capitalism]]. 
marx believed that when [[society]] is fully industrialized, then workers will overthrow [[capitalism]]. 
as in a fully industrialized [[society]], masses will be workers. 

## resolution to overthrow [[capitalism]]
(14:27)
[[revolution]] to overthrow [[capitalism]] will be led only by workers. 
workers are vanguards of [[communism]] as per marx.
that is marx did not have faith in poor peasants. 
that was  b/c as per marx, peasants are petty bourgeoises, who have a vested interest in private property, which breeds profit motive & [[capitalism]]. 
while marx wanted ‘community ownership’.
also, a sense of joint [[production]] & community labour is absent among small peasants. 
as they rely on family labour. 
therefore, peasants' grievances are valid, but they cannot be leaders of communist [[revolution]].

## why violence is needed?
(14:42)
[[revolution]] can be achieved only by violent methods  b/c state, police, military, bureaucracy, & [[law]]s are all agents of bourgeoisie. 
therefore [[capitalism]] is all-[[power]]ful & can be overthrown only by a violent revolt by masses. 
marx, therefore, wanted a stateless [[society]] with total decentralization of political [[power]] in hands of community. 
in a multi-party democracy, there is political capture by capitalists. 
marx desired dictatorship of proletariat (workers). 
dictatorship means absolute will: hence absolute will of masses, therefore he wanted true democracy. 
hence, as per marx, multi-party democracy has led to fake democracy. 

## inter[[nationalism]]
(14:49)
since [[capitalism]] is a global force, therefore workers of whole world need to unite to end [[capitalism]]. 
marx was opposed to disunity among workers on basis of race, colour, religion, nationality, language, ethnicity, etc.
ex: established 1st international, which opposed franco-prussian [[war]] in [[1870]]. 
wars in [[colonialism]] are a result of [[capitalism]], as goal is to maximise profit of capitalist class by capturing new sources of raw materials & export markets. 
therefore, at global level also, [[capitalism]] leads to conflict & disharmony. 
there exist diff roads to [[socialism]], i.e. diff schools of thought, on how to achieve [[socialism]], & marxism is just 1 of roads. 
for ex, fabianism (also k/a social democracy), democratic [[socialism]], gandhian [[socialism]].
then followers of marx also implemented his ideas with certain changes on basis of their country's contexts. 
for ex, leninism, stalinism, maoism/agrarian [[communism]].
word fabianism comes from britain, also k/a social democracy. 

## fabianism
(15:21)
fabian [[society]] was set up in [[1883]] in england. 
and from this emerged labour party in 1900. 
jl nehru, annie besant, obama as said to be exs of fabianists. 
believe in non-violent means & in gradual [[reform]]s rather than violent [[revolution]].
they don’t want end of [[capitalism]] & private property, but only removal of negatives of [[capitalism]]. 
therefore believe, that [[socialism]] & [[capitalism]] can coexist. 
believe in a multiparty system rather than a stateless [[society]], with right to vote for workers. 
believe in a strong welfare state, i.e. use legislative, executive & financial [[power]]s of [[state]] for welfare of weaker sections of [[society]]. 
for ex: 
use of [[law]]s that safeguard interests of workers & poor. 
minimum wages are guaranteed by [[law]]. 
affordable healthcare & education including free healthcare & free education for poorest of poor.
social security in form of pensions, unemployment allowance & insurance schemes for poor. 
public works programme for reducing unemployment. for ex mgnrega.
mixed economy: that is participation of [[state]] along with private sector in manufacturing of goods & services in economy. 
so [[state]] can share burden of employment & engage in [[production]] for social good. 
for ex, new deal in[[1933]]set up a new welfare [[state]] in united state. 
it was in germany, that largest party of workers emerged in 19th century. 

## democratic [[socialism]]
(15:36)
here primary focus is on democracy, i.e. [[power]] to people. 
and not with capitalists or even a welfare state. 
therefore they are against centralisation of [[power]]. & hence against idea of welfare [[state]] of fabianists. 
or against one-party communist [[state]] of leninists. 
they believe in [[socialism]] from below, & reject [[socialism]] from above. 
in polity, they desire a weak [[state]] with maximum [[power]] to local bodies at grassroot-levels. 
for ex pris, urban local bodies, or soviets in russia. 
in economy: farms under collectives of peasants. 
and not under [[state]] ownership.
plus factories are under workers’ councils & not state-appointed managers. 
democratic [[socialism]] is divided into 2 groups: 
violent & non-violent methods.
in india, it's said that there exists democratic [[socialism]] due to stress upon pris.
however, we have a mix of fabianism (social democracy) & democratic [[socialism]].
with a strong influence of gandhian ideology.

## agrarian [[socialism]]
(15:56)
equality in land distribution without ending property.
joint [[production]] is achieved via organising peasants. 
voluntary cooperatives.

## agrarian [[communism]]

end to private property.
make [[state]] or community owner.
now peasants as workers engaged in joint [[production]] on community land. 

topic for next class: russian [[revolution]] onwards.
