monopolistic competition is a market structure in which there is a large number of sellers in market of a commodity. #doubt (my reasoning - but monopoly is when there is only 1 seller ?????? right ?????)
product of each seller differs in some respect from product of other sellers.
thus, product differentiation is cornerstone of monopolistic competition.
monopolistic competition is like an amalgam of monopoly & perfect competition, & hence name monopolistic competition.
acc to j.s. bains, "monopolistic competition is a market structure where there is a large number of sellers, selling differentiated but close substitute products."
ex: restaurants, market for toothpaste etc.
## features of monopolistic competition
large number of firms:
	• under monopolistic competition, there is a large number of firms selling closely related products.
	• thus control of a particular firm is somewhat diminished when compared to that of a monopoly.
product differentiation:
	• product differentiation is a very important feature of monopolistic competition.
	• this differentiation could be on basis of quality, packaging, colour etc. or this differentiation could also be just a matter of perception.
	• for example, you must have seen different brands of toothpaste. even if they look different having different tastes, product has same use.
selling costs:
	• under monopolistic competition, firms spend a lot on advertisement of their product in order to attract customers & sell their products.
	• every firm tries to promote its product through an advertisement for which it bears some extra cost over & above its cost of production.
	• this is called selling cost.

non-price competition:
	• under monopolistic competition, sometimes, firms compete with each other without changing prices.
	• they may start various promotion schemes, gift schemes or compete in terms of advertisement etc.
	• thus, firms compete in every possible way to attract consumers & gain maximum possible market share.
