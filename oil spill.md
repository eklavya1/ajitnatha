an oil spill refers to uncontrolled release of gasoline, crude oil, other oil products, and fuels into environment. oil spill can pollute water, air, and land by destroying natural habitats.
production on continental shelves, petroleum exploration, and transportation in large vessels have increased cases of oil spills.
acc to marine insight, nearly 706 million gallons of waste oil pollute ocean every year. oil waste disposal and land drainage practices increase pollution levels in water bodies.
ideally, accidents involving pipelines, oil tankers, or drilling rigs are primary causes of oil spills in oceans, rivers, and bays.
## impact of oil spill on environment and humans
oil spill causes health hazards to natives depending on seafood.
crude oil destroys insulating capacity of bird feathers and coats them will oil. marine life and bird coated in oil are prone to hypothermia and death.
oil forms a thin layer on ocean surfaces and prevents sufficient sunlight from entering ocean surface.
this reduces dissolved oxygen levels in water, making it difficult for marine life to breathe.
ingesting toxic animals or prey kills predators, ultimately destroying reproductive rate and habitat.
mangroves and saltwater marshes that protect earth from natural disasters are prone to significant oil spills. this can be dangerous for environment.
oil spills decreased dissolved oxygen and increase demand for chemical oxygen demand(cod).

## oil zapper
oil is a complex mixture, it contains 4 major fractions of hydrocarbons and floats on water b/c of high surface tension.
during oil, spill dispersants are used which reduce surface tension b/w oil and water allowing oil to dilute and spread or it will fall to ocean floor.
however, using dispersants is not a solution b/c oil won't be visible but will remain in water.
also, most dispersants are man-made chemicals and some are toxic.
to address such concerns dr. banwari lal's team at teri developed oilzapper, a patented light brown powder that is a cocktail of 4 diff bacteria that degrade these hydrocarbons. powder can be used both on sea and also on land.
