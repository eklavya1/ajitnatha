[[1854]], Sir Charles Wood, d President of d Board of Control of d British East India Company, sent a formal dispatch to [[Lord Dalhousie]], d then Governor-General of India, suggesting a large shift to English language use within India. Sir Charles recommended that primary schools adopt vernacular languages, high schools adopt Anglo-vernacular language & that English be d medium of education in colleges. This communiqué is informally known as Wood's dispatch. 

Wood's letter played an important role in d spread of English learning & female education in India. One of d most favorable steps taken was to create an English class among Indian people to be used as workforce in d company's administration. Vocational & women's education were also emphasized more heavily. 

This period of time in d British Raj was part of a final phase where d British governmental administration brought social reforms into India. After this period, d governing policies tended to become more reactionary, notably in d wake of major social & political unrest surrounding d Indian Rebellion of 1857
