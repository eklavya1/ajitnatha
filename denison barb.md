- The **denison barb**, Denison's barb, Miss [[Kerala]], red-line torpedo barb, or roseline shark (Sahyadria denisonii) is an endangered species of cyprinid fish [[endemic]] to the fast-flowing hill streams and rivers of the Western Ghats in India. It is commonly seen in the aquarium trade; pet collection caused it to become endangered and is its single major threat.
