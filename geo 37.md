monsoon.

# winter conditions in india:

low temperature & high-pressure conditions result in anti-cyclonic circulations.
winds blow outwards from land over which air is subsiding, winds are dry & cold.
subtropical westerly jet stream is strong & well established. it's bifurcated into 2 branches over north & south of tibetan plateau.
southern branch is stronger & is located along northern ganga plains.
this intensifies surface anti-cyclones leading to clear & dry sky weather.
winds blow from land to sea in northeast direction.
northeast winds after crossing bay of bengal pickup moisture & causes precipitation along coromandel coast.

# springs weather conditions in india.

weather is hot & dry.
subtropical jet streams begin to weaken & southern branch eventually moves entirely to north of tibetian plateau.
temperature starts to rise & pressure falls.
these conditions lead to convection in some places resulting in precipitation c/a pre-monsoon showers.
ex of pre-monsoon showers:
mango showers:
blow in kerala & karnataka & helps in early ripping of mangos.
cherry blossom or blossom showers:
they blow in kerala & karnataka & helps in coffee flowering.
nor wester/kal baisakhi/bardoli chehra:
they blow in orissa, west bengal, & other eastern parts.
they help in jute, rice, & tea cultivation.
loo:
it blows in northern plain.
it's hot & dry wind.

# summer conditions in india

complete development of low-pressure cells over desert & northern plains clauses itcz to shift completely north & to lie over northern plains.
this shift attracts southern trade winds toward north of equator.
after crossing equator trade winds turn right under influence of coriolis force & start blowing as southwest monsoon winds.
temperature stratification in air does not allow upward movement of air preventing major storms.
tropical easterly jet streams which develop over india in summers help in disturbance in air.
this along with monsoon depression in bay of bengal causes busting of monsoon.
busting of monsoon:
it's sudden onset of moisture-laden wind associated with violent thunder & lightning.
these monsoon winds gradually get disturbed all over india causing monsoon rainfall.
break in monsoon:
in some regions due to local stable conditions temperature stratification reappears resulting in a break in monsoon.
it might also happen due to winds blowing parallel to topography.
retreating of monsoon:
itcz starts moving back gradually toward south.
this also brings back maximum extent to which southwest winds blow.
southwest winds slowly get replaced by northeast winds.
subtropical westerly jet stream reappears to south of tibetian plateau creating dry conditions.
occasionally high temperature & dry conditions co-exist in october along northern plains c/a october heat.

# characteristics of monsoon

onset of monsoon is gradual & withdrawal is more gradual.
rainfall decreases from sea to land.
amount of precipitation decreases from sea to land.
duration of precipitation decrease from south to north.
high temporal variation: variation of rainfall with time.
high spatial variation: variation of rainfall from 1 region to another.

# distribution of monsoon 

sw monsoon gets divided into 2 branches: arabian sea branch & bay of bengal branch.
bay of bengal branch:
it moves parallel to coromandel coast thus coast remains totally dry.
precipitation gradually starts around andhra pradesh & orissa coasts. 
after moving over west bengal it hit himalayas & get divided into 2 branches.
one branch moves westward along ganga plains.
other branch strikes garo & khasi hills of meghalaya.
some of winds also move toward himalayas & cause rainfall in himalayas.
# arabian sea branch:
it hits west coast perpendicularly.
west side of western ghats receives good rainfall.
rain shadow part of western ghats remains mostly dry.
but some winds do find a way to interior regions & cause rainfall when they encounter mountains. for ex in madhya pradesh, chattishgarh, jharkhand, etc. 
it moves parallel to aravali & causes very low rainfall here.
both bay of bengal & arabian sea branches meet near agra.
western up, haryana, punjab, uttrakhand, himachal pradesh, jammu-kashmir, & ladakh receive rainfall from both branches.

# western disturbance

during winters northern india experiences cold & dry conditions along with strong westerly jet streams
mediterranean region receives rainfall due to onshore westerlies & temperate cyclones.
sub-tropical westerly jet streams along mediterranian region pick up moisture content & low-pressure conditions & are brought to india.
when these winds accumulate near northwest himalayas, it causes precipitation.
precipitation due to western disturbance decrease from west to east along ganga plains.
seasons of western disturbance are b/w october to april.
significance of western disturbance:
it causes abrupt decrease in temperature in northern plains & snowfall in himalayas.
they are good for winter crops of wheat & mustard.
it may result in cloudbursts & flash floods.

# soils of india

factor affecting soil:
parent rock:
regions of deccan traps contain black soil whereas granite & gneiss in rest of peninsula have resulted in red soil.
climate:
very high rainfall & temperature at western ghats resulted in laterite soil whereas other dry regions of peninsular plateau contain red soil.
low rainfall in rajasthan deserts resulted in saline soil. 
organism:
vegetation adds humus content making soil more fertile & causing development of multiple layers. for ex, soils of central india are rich in humus than soils of arid interior of karnataka & maharashtra.
relief:
it decides thickness of soil.
in himalayas is very thin which is mountain soil. whereas in northern plain they are thicker which are alluvial soils.
time: ex of time as a factor for soil formation are banger & khadar soils.
forest soil:  it's found in forest & mountain regions.
peaty soil: it's found in coastal regions.
