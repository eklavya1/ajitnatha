## balance of payment (bop)
- (2:26:00 pm)
- [[balance of payments]]
- balance of account bop is a statement of account regarding a country's transactions (residence) with rest of world (non-residence).
- here countries include households, firms, & government (residence).
- bop has two sub-account on basis of nature of transaction that is current account & capital account.
- current account: it records those transactions which are current in nature i.e. they are settled transactions. it has no future implication arises in their respect.
- capital account: these transactions are those which have an element of future i.e. time. these create implications for a country’s assets & liabilities.
- transactions on current & capital accounts are independent of each other, but they are linked through a change in reserves.
- bop, which is an account of a country’s foreign transactions, is necessitated because these transactions are usually carried out in foreign currency. reserves of a country’s foreign currencies are called foreign reserves get accumulated or drained because of foreign transactions. current & capital account transactions are balanced through drawdown or accretions of reserves & that is why we say payments are balanced.

## current account
- [[current account]]
- it consists of trade in goods (merchandise trade: imports & exports) & trade in services, earning & incomes, & transfers.
- trade & goods & services are settled transactions. trade in goods is known as merchandise goods. these goods are tangibles & can touch them & trade in services are invisible. trade in services is part of invisible.
- invisible includes trade in services, earning & incomes & transfers.
- a person from india has purchased share of apple company. it is an investment. here it involves an element of time. thus it is a capital account. apple will earn profit & transfer a dividend to me. then this dividend will be part of current account.
- trade in goods means merchandise trade that can be further divided into imports & exports.
- invisibles: it consists of trade in services, earnings & incomes, & transfers. trade in services that include imports & exports.

## current account balance (cab)
(3:40:00 pm)
- a country imports & exports goods from rest of world. this creates an outflow & inflow respectively of foreign currency from & to country. on a net basis, there is a merchandise net balance depending on inflows & outflows.
- similarly, on accounts of invisibles, there would be a net inflow & outflow depending on whether more money goes from country (residence) to rest of world (non-residence).
- together a net balance of merchandise & invisibles is calculated & is called current account balance, if it’s negative we call it deficit if it is positive we call it surplus.

## capital account
(3:52:00 pm)
- it consists of investments & borrowings (loans).
- investments include investment from india abroad & investment from abroad to india.
- investments can be direct or indirect.
- borrowings could be commercial or non-commercial.

## capital account balance
(4:06:00 pm)
- it consists of net of inflows & outflows on capital account i.e. that is from borrowings & investments.
- current & capital accounts together will lead to either accretion or drawdown of reserves. actual change in reserves is measured & errors & omissions accounted for to balance payments between residents & non-residents through reserves.
