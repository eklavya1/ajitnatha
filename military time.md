[[2022-04-07]] 03:45 [military time- how to convert military alphabet - for precise military communication](https://militaryalphabet.net/military-time/)
military time is easy - each hour is marked by its own number. from 1 a.m. to 12 p.m., time stays same, but written 0100, 0200, etc., all way to 1200. after 12 noon, next hour is 1300, followed by 1400, etc. midnight is 2400 or 0000, marking where 1 day ends & another begins.

how to convert back to regular time w/o a military time converter:
	know time you want to convert. for ds ex, we’ll use 1600 hours.
	subtract 1200 from your time. 1600 – 1200 = 400, which gives you 4:00 p.m. regular time.
