- eka movement or unity movement is a peasant movement that surfaced in hardoi, bahraich & sitapur of united provinces during end of [[1921]].
- initially started by congress & khalifat movement, it was later headed by madari pasi.
- main reason for movement was high rent, which was generally higher than 50% of recorded rent in some areas.
- oppression by thikadars who were entrusted to collect rent & practice of share rent also contributed to this movement.
- eka meetings were marked by a religious ritual in which a hole that represented river ganga was dug in ground & filled with water, a priest was brought in to preside & assembled peasants vowed that they would -
	- pay only recorded rent but pay it on time.
	- would not leave when ejected.
	- would refuse to do forced labour.
	- would give no help to criminals & abide by panchayat decisions.
	- they would not pay revenue without a receipt.
	- would remain united under any circumstance.
- small zamindars who were disenchanted with [[british]] government due to heavy land revenue demand were also a part of this movement.
by march [[1922]], severe repression by authorities brought movement to an end.
