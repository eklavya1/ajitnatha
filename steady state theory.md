- in cosmology, the steady-state model  is an alternative to the big bang theory of evolution of the universe. in the steady-state model, the density of matter in the expanding universe remains unchanged due to a continuous creation of matter,  thus adhering to the perfect cosmological principle, a principle that asserts that the observable universe is practically the same at any time and any place.

- while the steady-state model enjoyed some minority support in the scientific mainstream until the mid-20th century, it is now rejected by the vast majority of cosmologists, astrophysicists and astronomers, as the observational evidence points to a hot big bang cosmology with a finite age of the universe, which the steady-state model does not predict.
