sahūr or suhūr (uk: ; arabic: سحور, romanized: suḥūr, lit. 'of the dawn', 'pre-dawn meal'), also called sahari, sahrī or sehri (persian/urdu: سحری, bangla: সেহরী) is the meal consumed early in the morning by muslims before fasting (sawm), before dawn during or outside the islamic month of [[ramadan]]. the meal is eaten before fajr prayer. sahur corresponds to iftar- the evening meal during ramadan, replacing the traditional three meals a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), although in some places dinner is also consumed after iftar later during the night.

being the last meal eaten by muslims before fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of ramadan, suhur is regarded by islamic traditions as a benefit of the blessings in that it allows the person fasting to avoid the crankiness or the weakness caused by the fast. according to a hadith in sahih al-bukhari, anas ibn malik narrated, "the prophet said, 'take suhur as there is a blessing in it.'"
