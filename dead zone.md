dead zones are low-oxygen or hypoxic, areas in world's oceans & lakes.
natural causes include coastal upwelling & changes in wind.
natural dead zones can be found worldwide, particularly near regions where strong upwelling occurs.
stratification of water column due to density differences also contributes to formation of hypoxic or "dead zones".
	cooler, saltier (denser) water from ocean, flows underneath warmer, fresher (less dense) water from rivers.
	boundary c/a a pycnocline, forms & oxygen consumed below pycnocline cannot be replenished from above.
dead zones also occur because of eutrophication, which happens when a body of water gets too many nutrients, such as phosphorus & nitrogen.
with too many nutrients, cyanobacteria grow out of control, which can be harmful.
human activities are main cause of these excess nutrients being washed into ocean.
for this reason, dead zones are often located near inhabited coastlines.
