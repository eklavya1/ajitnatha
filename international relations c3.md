a brief review of previous class has been given. (1:08 pm)

## continuation of phase-1
continuation of phase-1 (1:15 pm):

was policy of non-alignment based only on shared idealism? :

it's considered to be india's idealism  b/c it was rooted in indian civilizational values, values that inspired indian national movement.
also, in then bi-polar world characterized by defense pacts such as nato & warsaw, india's emphasis on non-violence & global cooperation made it seem like india's policy of non-alignment was india's idealism.

however, like any foreign policy(generally), it was based on practical considerations :

given limited economic resource, india wanted to limit high defense expenditure & rather use available resources towards development of country ;
india was in geographical proximity to communist bloc while being ideologically more inclined towards liberalism. though india was inspired by values of equality espoused by communalism & its strategy such as 5-year plan for faster economic development but having faced 200 years of colonial subservience, liberty was prime most aspiration. however, in communist countries, often liberty was compromised for equality.
congress rainbow coalition-people of various ideological inclinations were part of congress party & various ideologies existed/flourished in country.

## other features of phase-i

## phase-ii (1962-71)
phase-ii (1962-71)(1:46 pm):

this decade is referred to as fractured years of indian polity.
india faced challenges both on external as well as domestic front -india fought 3 wars; witnessed political turbulence & economic distress; india was on brink of famine & had to import food grains from us under humiliating terms of public law-480(pl-480).
it was in this decade, india made pragmatic choices on foreign policy, security, & political challenges.
india took steps towards military preparedness, green revolution & thus, came out of anxious period without many losses.
in fact, strategic choices of this decade launched us into a period of great regional assertion.

## phase-iii (1971-91)
phase-iii (1971-91)(2:01 pm):

this is period of great indian re-assertion.it started with decisive dismantlement of pakistan & creation of bangladesh.
during this time, foll sino-us rapprochement & development of us-china-pakistan axes & india signed treaty of peace, friendship, & cooperation with soviet union in 1971.
two weeks into war, india militarily prevailed over pakistan & emerged as undisputed leader of indian sub-continent.
despite india's regional ascendence, india could not become a recognized global power  b/c of underperformance of indian economy. it was trapped in so-c/a hindu rate of growth(3-4% of annual gdp growth).
nuclear weapon test-indira gandhi authorized india's 1st nuclear test-it's referred to as 'smiling buddha'/'peaceful nuclear explosion'/snep(sub-terranean nuclear explosion project). this test failed & india faced widespread global diplomatic disapprovation & significant economic & technological sanctions.
this phase comes to end with india's ipkp's misadventure in sri lanka.

## phase-iv(1991-2001)

this is a period of usa's unipolarity. major developments are:

relevance of nam is questioned-questions were raised 'non-aligned against whom of non-aligned to whom?'
india's foreign policy became a dearth of great strategic vision-india needed to improve its relations with then single superpower us & bandwagon with it.
india witnessed bop crisis as a consequence of 1st gulf war, india was forced to borrow from imf which conditioned loans on india's economic restructuring -thus india undertook lpg reforms & adopted new economic policy which fuelled india's gdp growth.

at political level, india launched :

look-east policy-in search of new markets.
normalization of relations with israel in 1992.
india crossed nuclear rubicon.

india developed nuclear weapons because:

long-term security threats from china.
india feared international pressures to check nuclear proliferation would increase in near future (due to indefinite extension of ntbt in 1995; efforts by then clinton ad14ministration and; to conclude ctbt at earliest).
operation shakti was successful & india became a de facto nuclear-weapon state.

terms of engagement that china is offering to world have hardened.
american alternative to rising china seems more & more uncertain.
europe is turning more & more inwards adopting a protectionist approach.
japan's efforts to have a greater say in world affairs are only unfolding gradually.
under such international scenario, india has adopted energetic diplomacy in form of fast-track diplomacy.
there is a growing sense of india's belief in its own capabilities.
india needs to shoulder global responsibility & with west turning more inwards-there is greater evidence of india's such abilities.

## relevance of nam
relevance of nam(3:43 pm):

context of this discussion: external ministers jaishankar claimed that nam was a concept was of relevance in a specific era & in a particular context, though independence of action enshrined in it remains a factor of continuity in india's foreign policy.

## context of emergence of nam
context of emergence of nam:

afro-asian resurgence-urge for freedom from colonial rule led to development of a distinct idea of active & independent involvement in world affairs based on one's own national interest.
world was divided into 2 blocs-capitalist blocs led by usa & communist bloc led by russia.
