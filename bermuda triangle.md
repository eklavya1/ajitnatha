the bermuda triangle, also known as the devil's triangle, is an urban legend centered around a loosely defined region in the western part of the north [[atlantic ocean]] where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. the idea of the area as uniquely prone to disappearances arose in the mid-20th century, but most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery.
