process that describes how structure of a biological community (that is, an interacting group of various species in a desert, forest, grassland, marine environment, and so on) changes over time.
**there are two types of succession -**
[[primary succession]]
[[secondary succession]]
## primary succession on rocks
these are usually lichens that can secrete acids to dissolve rock, helping in weathering and soil formation.
these later pave way for some very small plants like bryophytes, which can take hold in small amount of soil. they are, with time, succeeded by higher plants, & after several more stages, ultimately a stable climax [[forest]] community is formed.
climax community remains stable as long as the environment remains unchanged. with time xerophytic habitat gets converted into a mesophytic one.
## primary succession in water
the pioneers are the small phytoplankton.
phytoplanktons are gradually replaced with time by rooted-submerged plants,rooted-noating angiosperms followed by free-floating plants, then reed-swamp, marsh-meadow, scrub and finally the trees.
the climax again would be a forest. with time the water body is converted into land

	- refers to _directional changes_ in structure & composition of biotic communities on a particular geographical area
	- can also happen in reverse _related_ [[roman empire]] | [[europe]] [[gaul]] [[franks]]
	- like process of [[pax urbanica]] was climaxed at the time of [[ashoka]] #pneumonic _psc_
		- pioneer community [[chandragupta maurya]]
		- seral community [[bindusara]]
		- climax community [[ashoka]]
	- starts with the pioneer community , followed by seral comm (intermediate stages) & stabilized with the formation of climax community
	- it can occur on various sites viz. deserts, mountains, slopes, ponds, lakes, etc (terra as well as aqua)
	- determined by climatic conditions of area
