- a legislator is deemed to have defected if he either voluntarily gives up membership of his party or disobeys directives of party leadership on a vote (voting against direction of whip in house)

- this implies that a legislator defying (abstaining or voting against) party whip on any issue can lose his membership of house. law applies to both parliament and state assemblies.

- constitution lays down that a person shall be disqualified from being a member of parliament if he is so disqualified on ground of defection under provisions of tenth schedule. a member incurs disqualification under defection law -

- if he voluntarily gives up membership of political party on whose ticket he is elected to house;
- if he votes or abstains from voting in house contrary to any direction given by his political party;
- if any independently elected member joins any political party;
- if any nominated member joins any political party after expiry of six months.

- he has been convicted for any offence resulting in imprisonment for two or more years. this criterion for disqualification is mentioned in [[representation of people act 1951]], not under tenth schedule of [[constitution]] of [[india]].
