# Soaps and detergents
(6:29 PM)

- They reduce the surface tension of water so that the cleansing properties of water are enhanced.
- Dirt=Fat (oil) + Dust
- soap molecules align themselves in such a fashion that dirt is trapped in them. This structure is called micelles. 
- In the process of rinsing, micelles come out with dirt and hence clothes get cleaned.
- Soaps- Sodium/Potassium salt of fatty/ carboxylic acid.
- Detergent- are salts of sodium or Potassium of sulphonic acid
- Soaps- comparatively softer
- Detergents- Harder
- Soaps are not effective in hard water or saline water because they interact with the metallic salt present in them and hence soaps lose their cleansing properties.
- Whereas detergents do not interact with metallic salt and hence, are effective in hard water as well.
- Water-H20
- Hard water- Normal water+metallic salt i.e. H2O +salts of magnesium /calcium etc.
- Heavy water- D2O
