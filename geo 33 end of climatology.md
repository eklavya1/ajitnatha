# summary	


[[mjo madden-julian oscillation]]

unlike el nino which is stationary, mjo is eastward moving disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds, & pressure systems that traverses planet in tropics & returns to its initial starting point in 30 to 60 days, on average.
mjo has 2 parts:
one: enhanced rainfall.
second: suppressed rainfall.
mjo can modulate timing & strength of monsoon & tropical cyclones.

indian ocean dipole

difference in sea surface temperature b/w western arabian sea & eastern indian ocean of indonesia is c/a as indian ocean dipole.
similar to mjo, it's a coupled ocean & atmospheric phenomenon.

positive iod :

warm sea surface in western part relative to eastern part.
less rainfall in indonesia & australia.
good for indian monsoon.
reduces impact of el nino on india.

negative iod:

warm sea surface in eastern part than western part.
more rains in indonesia & australia.
bad for indian monsoon.
increases impact of el nino on india.

heat dome

occurs when atmosphere traps hot ocean air like a lid or cap.

tides

regular rise & fall of water level in worldâ€™s ocean resulting from gravitational attraction by moon & sun is c/a tides
combined gravitational pull of sun & moon pulls ocean water in a bulge.
centrifugal force due to earthâ€™s revolution pulls another bulge in opposite direction.
bulges in 1 direction create low water in another.
as earth rotates this position of high & low water changes across surface

factors affecting tides:

gravitational pull of sun & moon.
centrifugal force of earthâ€™s revolution.
relative position of sunâ€™s & moon.
uneven distribution of water.
ocean bottom topography.

types of tides:
spring tides:

these are very high tides & very low tides which occur during 2 conditions, as shown below:
conjunction (same side on earth) i.e new moon
opposition i.e full moon
during spring sides, sun, earth & moon are in strike syzygy.

neap tides:

these are smaller high tides & smaller low tides that are experienced when sun & moon are in perpendicular directions. 
such position of sun, moon & earth is c/a quadrature.
diurnal & semi diurnal tides
tides occurring twice a day are c/a semi-diurnal tides.
and those occurring once a day is c/a diurnal tides.
significance of tides
it helps in generation of tidal energies.
it helps in navigation too.
helps in shipbuilding industry.
it helps in natural cleansing of coastal regions as well as deposition of waste.
it helps in maintaining biodiversity along with tidal range with favourable conditions for both ecosystem.
it leads to coastal erosion & coastal flooding.
it adversely impacts delta formation & mangroves formation.
many of fish species come in upper river streams & lay eggs eg hilsa fish

biogeography

it's study of soil in relation to its vegetation.
soil is loose surface material consisting of inorganic & organic matter & is source of water & nutrients for vegetation.
true soil is characterised by presence of distinct horizons & its capability to support plants.
layer of unconsolidated material derived from weathering of parent rock is regolith.
soil column extending down from surface to regolith is c/a a pedon.
a distinguishable layer in soil that has certain chemical & distinct colours is c/a soil horizon.
exs: 
soil horizon: o,a,b,c
vertical horizon of arrangement down to parent rock material is c/a a soil profile. ^9a0d31

eluviation:

elluviation is downward transport process through which minerals are removed from top layer.

illuviation:

it's layers of eluviated material that gets deposited in ower horizon.

factors affecting soil formation (pcort) ^21345f

- parent rock material: original rock material influences colour, texture & other basic characteristics.
- however, influence of parent rock diminishes with time.
- climate: it affects directly by controlling weathering & percolation & leads to development of diff horizons.
- climate is most dominant factor of all.
- [[organism]]s: it helps in biological weathering. [[environment c3#^013e2f]]
- plant roots & burrowing animals help in loosening up soil & air circulation.
- relief: it determines thickness of soil.
- larger slope, smaller thickness of soil.
- time: determines maturity of soil.
- soil forming processes:

leaching:

these occur in regions, with heavy rains & percolation of water.
percolating water removes humus, soluble bases (minerals) from upper horizons & deposits in lower ones. it's more pronounced in humid regions.
laterisation: 
in hot & wet equatorial regions, heavy leaching removes silica & other minerals except for aluminium & iron which accumulated at surface leading to formation of hard iron crust i.e laterisation.
podzolization:
in temperate & polar climates & higher altitudes, formation of organic acids leads to removal of iron & aluminium & organic matter leaving top acidic layer of soil.

calcification:

accumulation of calcium carbonate in top layer of soil due to capillary action of water during evaporation.
eg temperate grassland soil.
salinization:
accumulation of high soluble sodium &  magnesium salts in soil in arid & semi-arid region is c/a salinization
gleyization:
in waterlogged conditions, colour of topsoil changes due to reduction reactions.
this phenomenon is c/a gleyisation
soil classification
pedalfer soil (precipitation more than evaporation)
pedocal ( capillary action predominates)
