    - Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
    - Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
    - Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.
    - Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
    - Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
    - Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
    - Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debuggingeasier.
    - Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
    - Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.
    - Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
    - Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
    - Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
    - Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
    - Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”.
    - Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
