- the usa's geographic isolation from the rest of the other Great powers and domination of its neighborhood means geopolitics is a sport, not a life or death matter for America. This means the US can afford to have a very unsubtle view.

	- Even more unfortunate is the conclusion that the U.S. itself lost its place in the world on account of its failure to have a sagacious leader or a competent Commander in  Chief. A superpower does not sink or rise on account of a single leader. It is still the most powerful economic and military power around which the whole constellation of the world rotates. `In fact, the world has a stake in ensuring that a democratic nation leads the world rather than an expansionist dictatorship which has no public opinion to restrain it`. The free world has a responsibility to maintain the American leadership of the world till a wiser and more benign alternative is found `source` - article the hindu `02:10 PM 05/9/2021` - CERTAINLY NOT THE END OF THE ROAD FOR THE USA
	- The U.S. has a rich history of shaping or toppling foreign governments and seeking to inﬂuence forces made abroad that had an impact on American shores. In the early 20th century, the centre of gravity of such clandestine operations was in the North American hemisphere, and it included the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama. In the post Second World War and post Cold War periods, it included the likes of Iran, Indonesia, and Venezuela, including alleged interference in the elections of Italy, the Philippines and Japan.

	- The First Gulf [[War]] revealed the vast technological gap that had opened up between the US military capability and that of other states. The highly publicised use of so- called ‘smart bombs’ by the US led some observers to call this a ‘computer war’. Widespread television coverage also made it a ‘video game war’, with viewers around the world watching the destruction of Iraqi forces live on TV in the comfort of their living rooms.Doesn’t that make it easy for Americans to get into [[military]] adventures?

5. Silicon Valley 是 a region in د southern partˋد San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California that serves as a global center for 高 technology, [[innovation]], and social media.
6. د word "silicon" in د 名. originally referred ݈ د large numberˋinnovators and manufacturers in د region specialising in silicon-based MOS transistors and integrated circuit chips. د area 是 now home ݈ manyˋد 世界 的 largest 高 -tech corporations, including د headquartersˋ更 than 30 businesses in د Fortune 1000, and thousandsˋstartup companies.

 - ### By virtueˋAmerica's scientific edge — and its democracy, creativity, and draw for immigrants
 	- د US 是 so powerful for reasons other than its size, its military might, and its global systemˋalliances and bases — although those 是 certainly important. There 是 也 America's tremendous advantage in scientific research, which 兩 furthers and 是 an expressionˋ its technological and economic lead on muchˋد restˋد 世界 ; it's 也 an indicatorˋ innovation 更 broadly. An imperfect 但 revealing shorthand for that 是 د US's tremendous lead in Nobel prizes من its [[1901]] inception through [[2013]], when I made this map (the US has 不 lost its Nobel lead since then). د US has won 371 Nobels, mostly in د sciences;
 	- د US thus accounts for 4 percentˋد 世界 [[population]] 但 34 percentˋ its Nobel laureates. ^868c9c
 	- This 是 د resultˋmany factors: wealth, a [[culture]] and economy that encourage innovation, [[education]], vast state- and private-funded research programs, and a political [[culture]] that has long attracted highly educated migrants. Allˋ those factors contribute to ݈ American wealth and thus power in 更 ways than just Nobel prizes, 但 د sheer numberˋUS laureates 是 a signˋد American advantage there.
