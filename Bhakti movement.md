The term 'Bhakti' refers to 'devotion'. As a movement, it emphasized the mutual intense emotional attachment and love of a devotee toward a personal god and of the god for the devotee.
This movement originated in South India in the 7th and 10th CE, mostly in the poems of Alvars and Nayanars.
These poems were composed in Tamil; the poems were addressed to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva respectively
Bhakti soon spread to North India, appearing most notably in the 10th-century Sanskrit text the Bhagavata-Purana.
It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards reached its peak between the 15th and 17th centuries CE.
The Bhakti Saints moved against the austerities propagated by the Buddhist and Jain schools and professed that ultimate devotion to god was the means to salvation.
