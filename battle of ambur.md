[[2022-04-21]] 19:42 [Battle of Ambur - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Battle_of_Ambur)
Battle of Ambur (3 August 1749) was the first major battle of the Second Carnatic War.[1]
The battle was initiated by Muzaffar Jung and supported by Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix and led by Chanda Sahib, who sought to overthrow Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan, the Nawab of the Carnatic, for supporting Nasir Jung's claim to be Nizam of Hyderabad. French forces were decisive in giving the allies victory; Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan was killed in the battle and Chanda Sahib seized control of the Carnatic.
