- • The term megalithic culture refers to the cultural remains found in the megaliths and from the habitation sites associated with them. Megaliths reflect certain burial styles that emerged at different times in different places and continued for quite some time.
 • The three basic types of megaliths are the chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials.
 ◦ The chamber tombs usually consist of a chamber (the size and shape of which may vary) composed of two or four vertical slabs of stone (known as orthostats), topped by a horizontal capstone.
 ▪️ If the chamber is underground, it is known as a cist.
 ▪️ If it is partly underground, it is known as a dolmenoid cist.
 ▪️ If it is fully above the ground, it is known as a dolmen.
 ▪️ Chamber tombs can have a hole known as a ‘port hole’ in one of the vertical slabs. They may also have a passage leading up to them.
 ▪️ The chamber is sometimes divided into sections by vertical slabs called transepts.
 ▪️ The chamber tombs include the topikals (literally, ‘hat stones’) and kudaikals (literally, ‘umbrella stones’), which are found in Kerala and Karnataka.
 ▪️ In the topikals, the burial urn is placed in an underground pit and is covered by a low, convex, circular capstone.
 ▪️ In the kudaikals, the urn is placed in a chamber consisting of four orthostats capped by a large hemispherical capstone.
 ◦ The unchambered burials are of three types: pit burials, urn burials, and sarcophagus burials.
 ▪️ In pit burials, the funerary remains are buried in a pit.
 ▪️ A sarcophagus burial consists of a terracotta trough (often with legs and lid) containing the funerary remains.
 ▪️ Urn burials consist of funerary remains placed in a large pot or urn, the mouth of which is sometimes covered by a stone slab.
 ▪️ Urn and sarcophagus burials are often included among megalithic burials, even if they are not marked by stones, as are burials in rock-cut caves.
 ◦ Not all megaliths are connected with burials. Some of them consist of alignments of large stones arranged in a geometric pattern. Although such monuments seem to be related to the megalithic tradition, their precise function and significance is not always clear.
