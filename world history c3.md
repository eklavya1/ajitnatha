World History Class 03

French Revolution(01:00 PM)

What? end of feudalism
Why is it important? (results) It resulted in rising of nationalism in the whole of Europe
The nation is the summation of people to feel one that is there is feeling of fraternity among the equal people.
The state is like the company or the organization that governs or administers the affairs of a country and its nation's people.
The country is nothing but the territory.
Therefore, Nationalism is about the supremacy of the interests of the people.
Therefore, it leads to the desire for democracy or a republic in the domain of polity.
In the domain of economy, there should be capitalism.
In the domain of society, there should be equality(no nobility), anti-colonialism.
There emerged a concept called ethnicity-based nations.
The sense of nationalism was leading to the desire for unification.
It resulted in 23 years of wars (from 1792 to 1815) in Europe.
After 1794, there was the rise of Napolean who made the French empire one of the strongest empires in Europe.
The roots of the United Nations(UN) can be traced from the FR that is the first organization of world peace called Concert of Europe(1815).

Feudalism in France(01:24 PM)

The Clergy:
The church was having social influence because the society was very religious.
It had a monopoly over religious matters.
The Clergy were the advisers to the king so they had political influence.
The Clergy was economically powerful because they had the largest per capita owners of the land.
Trials can take place only in religious courts.
They had an exemption from tax.
No Equality before the law as the Clergy can be tried in Ecclesiastical courts.
The nobility:
These people had a monopoly over bureaucracy and senior military positions.
These people dominated the judiciary. However, some middle class were also the judge as the judgeship could be purchased
They had the highest percentage of land ownership.
There was no meritocracy.
The commoners:
The workers and peasants.
They were the sole taxpayers
The peasantry was the small landowners, tenants, landless laborers.
For small landowners the taxes were very high, for tenants, the rents were very high.
The manor is the estate means a huge piece of land.
Manorial dues represent the indebtedness of the common man to lords.
Indebtedness had resulted in some kind of servitude.
Forced labor was there because of the certificate of good conduct.
The middle class was roughly 8 % of the population.
They had economic power because they were economically well off.
But they did not have the security of property.
They were TRADERS, Lawyers, Doctors, Writers, Thinkers.

Feudal polity(01:58 PM)

The absolute monarchy is ruled by the nobility.
Estates-General is the representative of three estates.
The estate general had only recommendatory power.
It met rarely after 1515.
It had skewed representation.
There was taxation without representation
There was no uniformity of law. 
There was no rule of law.
There was no equality before the law.
Posts of the judiciary could be purchased.

Feudal Economy(02:10 PM)

The economy was largely AGRARIAN ECONOMY and the land was the Source of the Power Economically.
It was a village Based economy.
There Was Concentration Of Landholdings Among The Nobility, Clergy while masses were Largely Landless.
Therefore, the Economy Was Dominated BY nobility hence masses engaged in production not as owners of Property and  NOT FOR PROFIT Motive. Therefore, the Modern CAPITALIST economy
was largely absent.
There was no RIGHT to PROPERTY For The 3rdestate
LACK OF Freedom of work for workers because of  Certificate of Good conduct
Although SERFDOM (where peasants are bound to the land and work for free for the landowner master) Was Absent. However, Due to manorial Dues i.e Indebtedness Of the Peasant Masses To Landowners, There existed servitude that is Providing LABOR in lieu of indebtedness, and Peasants were informally Bound to servitude therefore not Free.
The tithe was the tax under which one-tenth of LandRevenue To Be Paid By Landowners To CLERGY. Therefore,  It was not A TAX BUT A FEUDAL Levy.
TAILLE was the TAX BY STATE PAYABLE ONLY BY 3rdestate.

Reasons for French Revolution(02:31 PM)

Feudalism was the main reason.
Enlightenment thinkers.
Americal Revolution.
Unpopular monarchy for example King Louis 16 had a popular saying "Brainwork tires me".
Queen Mary Antoinette was called "madame debt" as in spite of the poverty in France and she was living the lavish lifestyle.
Famine from 1788-89.
Economically war expenditure without gains  For example defeat in Austrian war of succession, seven years wars, It also did not gain anything in the American war of independence.
The concentration of handholdings among first and  2ndestate while masses were economically oppressed and were sole Tax PAYERS.
No freedom of WORK
No security of property.
LACK OF ANY DEMOCRACY and Rule of King and Nobility.
Trigger: Meeting of the Estate General.
The king convened the meeting of the estate general in 100s of years.
In this meeting, there were three estates and only the third estate was the taxpayer.
Representatives of the third Estate asked to allow at least twice the representation.
Third Estate boycotted the meeting of the Estate General and went to Tennis Court.
They declared themselves as "National Assembly".
The Nobility tried to convince the king to disband the national Assembly(NA).
The NA started legislating the constitution and declared the rights of men and citizens.

French Revolution(02:50 PM)

Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen:
All men are born free and equal.
Equality before law.
Principle of innocent until proven otherwise.
All people were eligible to the public offices.
Freedom of speech and press.
Right to private property unless the public welfare necessitates infringing this right.
Society has a right to demand accountability from each civil servant.
The document gave the term nation its modern meaning i.e. a Nation is sum total of the people residing in a territory and not the territory itself.  The idea of Nation followed the idea of the sovereignty of the people.
Thus people were the source of all power and authority and there cannot be any ruler above the people but only a Republic.
The Revolution Ended Feudalism:
Equality of Taxation + Equality of Legal punishment i.e. Equality before Law
Rule of Law i.e. freedom to do anything unless barred by law.
Ended Manorial dues which led to land redistribution in favor of tillers.
Ended Tithe, Ended Taille.
All forms of personal servitude ended without the need for any redemption payment.
End to the purchase of public office e.g. Judgeship.
Ended Game Laws that barred people to hunt animals & birds. Now all could hunt pigeons.
Freedom of Work- no need for Certificate of Good Conduct now from the present employer for shifting job.
Above implemented By Constitution of 1791
Negatives: Right To Vote Was Linked with income criteria
The form of democracy adopted was CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY.

French Revolutionary WARS (1792- 1804) AND JACOBINS(03:02 PM)

JACOBINS Were members OF JACOBINS CLUB.
JACOBINISM STOOD FOR IDEOLOGY Of nationalism, Sacrifice, Social RIGHTS, and equality.
Their Support Base were workers who wanted RADICAL Reforms Like Right To Vote To All Males independent of income criteria and RIGHT To Work For All that is RIGHT TO Employment.
French Revolutionary WARS (1792- 1804):
Here French were Fighting as most other European kingdoms to Protect The Gains made From FR1789 While other kingdoms wanted to Restore The PRE FR1789 ORDER to Prevent SPREAD of ideas of Revolution among Their Population Which Could Have Threatened Privileges Of Nobility and Powers of the monarchy.
French versus the rest of the kingdoms of Europe.
They were anxious about the spread of ideas of FR.
The aim was to restore the power of monarchy and nobility.
In June 1791, King and Queen Failed To escape From France as they wanted to do A Counter-Revolution with the Help of other European Monarchs.
In April 1792, Austria, Savoy, Prussia attacked France. Now many French nobles who were also military commanders began defecting to the enemy side. Therefore wanted counter-revolution.
The influence of Jacobins increased in National ASSEMBLY and among PPL as WAR Defeats piled and NOBILITY Defected to the enemy.
They ARGUED to Defeat all enemies of FR1789- external as well as internal.
National ASSEMBLY REPLACED BY NATIONAL Convention that is a new Constituent Assembly com Parliament TO DRAFT A Constitution For France as A REPUBLIC DRAFTED in 1793 aka Jacobin Constitution.
Emergency War Defeats Piled UP and the  Jacobins Wanted Emergency Declared.
Neutrals Sided With Them.
Therefore, Emergency Powers Given To Committee on Public safety TO SAFEGUARD Revolution.
Reign of terror: JACOBINS Believed that They COULD Kill All Who Opposed The FR1789 and  THAT internal enemies of Revolution must Be eliminated and THAT Temporary Suspension Of Liberty Was Justified To Secure FR1789
ends more important than means.
Directory form of Government(1795-99):
Bourgeois Leaders Again Linked Right To vote to income criteria
Constitution Provided For A Republic With Govt Called Directory govt.
This Govt WAS:
a CORRUPT
Unstable because of Coalition government
Failed To Provide LAW and Order.
Failed To Contain Fiscal Deficit.
Therefore, BY 1799 Napoleon Was Viewed As A 'SAVIOR BY PeopLe of France "You need A savior and here I am."
And then He CAPTURED Power in 1799 in a coup.

Rise of Napolean(03:33 PM)

He Did not come from a noble family
He was highly ambitious and desperate but at the same time hardworking
The Revolution of 1789 provided equal opportunity for all
At the time of the 1789 revolution, he was part of the army
He really admired his mother and attributed all his success to his mother
Napolean was very nationalistic, ambitious and a man of unending energy
He was a captain in the army around 1794
Ready to suppress liberty.  More a person who cared about ends than the means to achieve them.
In 1794, France defeated Britain in Toulon with the help of Napolean’s suggested strategy. As a result, he was promoted to Brigadier General.
1795- protests were going on in Paris- People were unhappy with the directory government as it was unable to maintain law and order- They wanted to bring the monarchy back. Napolean was by chance present in Paris at that time. Directory government gave the task of suppressing the protest to Napolean. Napolean utilized this opportunity. He used brutal means to suppress the protest. Later he was awarded the post of Full General.
1796-97- He was designated as the commander of the army which was fighting in north Italy against Austria. There he met with Josphine (a widower belonging to nobility). He fought alongside his soldiers and was able to developed bonds with them. Finally, France was able to defeat Austria in Italy. After it he gained immense popularity in France and in the backdrop of failures of directory government, French nationalists started rallying behind him. Further, with the help of media, Napolean also began propaganda in his favor. As a result, he was perceived as Liberator in Italy.
It is said that Napolean was the first modern military commander because of his war strategies.
Treat of Campo Formio (1797) with Austria - Changed image of Napolean from a military man to a statesman
1798: Wins Battle of Pyramids by defeating Egypt but all his ships were destroyed by the British naval army and he failed to capture Syria. He returned back to France. However, the people of France cheered for him and got a hero’s welcome (a great propaganda victory for Napolean).
1799: With the help of his brother and some politicians in the directory government, he did a  coup against the Directory government and established a new government called consulate with three consuls
1800: Rewrote constitution to declare himself first consul i.e. head of state.
