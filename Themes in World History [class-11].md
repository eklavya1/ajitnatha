---
It included groups like the Turkic Uighurs, who had accepted his authority willingly. It also included defeated people, like the Kereyits, who were accommodated in the [[confederacy]] despite their earlier hostility. — location: [2068]()

---
This ranking did not preserve the rights of the old clan chieftains; the new [[aristocracy]] derived its status from a close relationship with the Great Khan of the Mongols. — location: [2080]()

---
it extended as far west as his horses could roam. — location: [2084]()

---
qanats, — location: [2099]()

---
The courier system (yam) was further refined after [[Genghis Khan]]’s death and its speed and reliability surprised travellers. — location: [2094]()

---
Genghis Khan had already fashioned a rapid courier system that connected the distant areas of his regime. — location: [2091]()

---
Once the dust from the campaigns had settled, [[Europe]] and China were territorially linked. In the peace ushered in by Mongol conquest (Pax Mongolica) trade connections matured. Commerce and travel along the [[Silk Route]] reached its peak under the Mongols but, unlike before, the [[trade]] routes did not terminate in China. — location: [2103]()

---
The contradictions between the nomadic and sedentary elements wit7hin the Mongol empire eased through the thirteenth century. — location: [2110]()

---
From [[Genghis Khan]]’s reign itself, the Mongols had recruited civil administrators from the conquered societies. They were sometimes moved around: Chinese secretaries deployed in Iran and Persians in China. They helped in integrating the distant dominions and their backgrounds and training were always useful in blunting the harsher edges of nomadic predation on sedentary life. — location: [2131]()

---
patrimony — location: [2142]()

---
The gradual separation of the descendants of [[Genghis Khan]] into separate lineage groups implied that their connections with the memory and traditions of a past family concordance also altered. At an obvious level this was the result of competition amongst the cousin clans and here the Toluyid branch was more adept in presenting their version of the family disagreements in the histories produced under their patronage. To a large extent this was a consequence of their control of China and Iran and the large [[number]] — location: [2148]()

---
regnant — location: [2152]()

---
Beyond the opinions of the defeated sedentary people, consider for a moment the sheer size of the Mongol dominion in the thirteenth century and the diverse body of people and faiths that it embraced. Although the [[Mongol]] Khans themselves belonged to a variety of different faiths – Shaman, Buddhist, Christian and eventually Islam – they never let their personal beliefs dictate public policy. — location: [2191]()

---
This was utterly unusual for the time, and historians are only now studying the ways in which the Mongols provided ideological models for later regimes (like the Mughals of India) to follow. — location: [2195]()

---
regalia, — [[location]]: [2225]()

---
In a world where uncertainties of life, poor sense of medicine and low life expectancy were common, the Church showed people how to behave so that life after death at least would be tolerable. — location: [2255]()

---
opulence — location: [2259]()

---
‘Renaissance’), especially in north Italian towns, the wealthy became less concerned with life after death and more with the wonders of life itself. — location: [2271]()

---
self-effacing — location: [2284]()

---
The Church was the centre for the study of other cultures and languages, but encouraged attacks on people it saw as ‘[[united nations]]-Christian’. — location: [2287]()

---
At the same time the diseases the Europeans brought devastated the populations, leading to the death of over 90 per cent of the people in some areas by the end of the sixteenth century. — location: [2292]()Guns, germs and steel 本书

---
Christianity, the official religion of the Roman Empire from the fourth century, survived the collapse of [[Rome]], and gradually spread to central and northern [[Europe]]. The Church also became a major landholder and political power in [[Europe]]. The — location: [2315]()

---
‘Abbey’ — location: [2359]()

---
Chapter 47: Idleness is the enemy of the [[soul]], so friars and sisters should be occupied at certain times in manual labour, and at fixed hours in sacred reading. Chapter 48: The monastery should be — location: [2445]()

---
‘taille’ — location: [2483]()

---
If a serf could stay for one year and one day without his lord discovering him, he would become a free man. — location: [2566]()

---
As the number of towns grew and trade continued to expand, town [[merchants]] became rich and powerful, and rivalled the power of the nobility. — location: [2575]()

---
Despite the severe repression, the sheer intensity of peasant opposition ensured that the old feudal relations could not be reimposed. The money economy was too far advanced to be reversed. — location: [2633]()

---
organising standing armies, a permanent bureaucracy and national taxation and, in Spain and [[Portugal]], began to play a role in [[Europe]]’s expansion overseas — location: [2643]()

---
The resistance of the aristocracies crumbled in the face of the firepower of the kings. — location: [2651]()

---
[[Rich]] [[merchants]] and [[bankers]] actively participated in governing the city, — location: [2719]()

---
([[Plato]] was Aflatun, and Aristotle Aristu in Arabic). — location: [2786]()

---
This was because of the greatest revolution of the sixteenth century – the mastery of the [[technology]] of printing. For this, Europeans were indebted to other peoples – the Chinese, for print[[technology|ing techno]]logy, and to Mongol rulers because European traders and diplomats had become familiar with it during visits to their courts. (This was also the case with three other important innovations – firearms, the compass and the abacus.) — location: [2843]()

---
The chief reason that the humanist culture of [[Italy]] spread more rapidly across the Alps from the end of the fifteenth century is that printed books were circulating. This also explains why earlier intellectual movements had been limited to particular regions. — location: [2859]()

---
wrote a pamphlet defending acquisition of wealth as a virtue. In On Pleasure, Lorenzo Valla (1406-1457), who believed that the study of history leads man to strive for a life of perfection, criticised the Christian injunction against pleasure. There was also a concern at this time with good manners – how one should speak politely and dress correctly, what skills a person of [[culture]] should learn. — location: [2864]()

---
Italians were strongly attracted to material wealth, power and glory, but they were not necessarily irreligious. — location: [2863]()

---
Machiavelli believed that ‘all men are bad and ever ready to display their vicious nature partly because of the fact that human desires are insatiable’. — location: [2876]()

---
The most powerful motive Machiavelli saw as the incentive for every human action is self-interest. — location: [2877]()

---
Europeans who went to the Americas kept log-books and diaries of their journeys. — location: [3025]()

---
They could not clear the dense forests for cultivation as they had no access to iron. But they had a healthy and plentiful supply of fruits, vegetables and fish, and so did not have to depend on [[agriculture]]. The Europeans who met them envied their happy freedom, with no king, army or church to regulate their lives. — location: [3051]()

---
[[confederacy]], — location: [3092]()

---
They did not develop a system of [[writing]]. However, there was an accounting system in place – the quipu, or cords upon which knots were made to indicate specific mathematical units. Some scholars now suggest that the Incas wove a sort of code into these threads. — location: [3103]()

---
The magnetic compass, which helped identify the cardinal points accurately, had been known since 1380, but only in the fifteenth century did people use it when they ventured on voyages into [[unknown]] areas. — location: [3130]()

---
The Vikings of Norway had reached North America in the eleventh century. — location: [3144]()

---
Why were Spanish and [[Portuguese]] rulers in particular so receptive to the idea of funding a maritime quest? What produced such a [[passion]] for gold and treasure and for glory and titles? One [[may]] find the answers in a combination of three motives: economic, religious and political. — location: [3145]()

---
Columbus planted a Spanish flag in Guanahani (which he renamed San Salvador), held a prayer service and, without consulting the local people, proclaimed himself [[viceroy]]. — location: [3180]()

---
The two [[continents]] were named after Amerigo Vespucci, a geographer from Florence who realised how large they might be, and described them as the ‘New World’. The name ‘America’ was first used by a German publisher in 1507. — location: [3194]()

---
Arawaks whose lack of immunity resulted in large-scale deaths. The — location: [3207]()

---
To [[military]] repression and forced labour was added the ravages of [[disease]]. The diseases of the [[Old World]], particularly smallpox wreaked havoc on the Arawaks whose lack of immunity resulted in large-scale deaths. The local people imagined these diseases were caused by ‘invisible bullets’ with which the Spaniards attacked them. The extinction of the Arawaks and all traces of their way of life is a silent reminder of their tragic encounter with Spaniards. — location: [3206]()

---
Conquest, Colonies and the Slave Trade What had begun as uncertain voyages came to have lasting consequences for [[Europe]], the Americas and Africa. — location: [3302]()

---
The capitalist system of [[production]] is one in which the means of [[production]] and distribution are owned by individuals or corporates and where competitors participate in a free market. — location: [3323]()

---
[[Britain]] has been the world’s first industrial nation and you will read about how this came to be in Theme — location: [3374]()

---
deluge — location: [3396]()

---
both developments, if the dates are read carefully, one will notice that there is a gap of a few decades between the [[development]] and its widespread application. One must not assume that a new innovation in [[technology]] led to it being used in the industry immediately. — location: [3502]()

---
By 1848, Britain was smelting more iron than the rest of the world put together. — location: [3539]()

---
In 1840, [[British]] steam engines were generating more than 70 per cent of all European horsepower. — location: [3595]()

---
colliery…Most — location: [3710]()

---
Members of Parliament – landowners, manufacturers and professionals – were opposed to giving the working [[population]] the right to vote. — location: [3726]()

---
Thus, there was a relatively greater concentration of workers in factories, and a wider use of money. — location: [3771]()

---
Industrialisation had actually been too gradual to be considered a ‘revolution’. It carried processes that already existed towards new levels. Thus, there was a relatively greater concentration of workers in factories, and a wider use of money. — location: [3770]()

---
Industrialisation is associated with a growing investment of the country’s wealth in ‘[[capital]] formation’, or building infrastructure and installing new machinery, and with raising the levels of efficient use of these facilities, and with raising [[productivity]]. — location: [3781]()

---
thronged — location: [3794]()

---
Displacing Indigenous Peoples — location: [3812]()

---
This last item was something the natives had not known earlier, and they became addicted to it, which suited the Europeans, because it enabled them to dictate terms of trade. (The Europeans acquired from the natives an addiction to [[tobacco]].) — location: [3910]()

---
taciturn — location: [3923]()

---
To the natives, the goods they exchanged with the Europeans were gifts, given in friendship. For the Europeans, dreaming of becoming [[rich]], the fish and furs were commodities, which they would sell for a profit in Europe. — location: [3929]()

---
They felt totally secure only with the invention of barbed wire in 1873. — location: [3963]()

---
The northern states of the USA, where the economy did not depend on plantations (and therefore on slavery), argued for ending [[slavery]] which they condemned as an inhuman practice. — location: [3968]()

---
This led to the building of railway lines across the continent, for which thousands of Chinese workers were recruited. — location: [4022]()

---
One reason why the [[Industrial Revolution]] happened in England when it did was because small peasants were losing their land to big farmers, and moving to jobs in factories (see Theme 9). In North America, industries developed for very different reasons – to manufacture railway equipment so that rapid transport could link distant places, and to produce machinery which would make large-scale farming easier. Industrial towns grew and factories multiplied, both in the USA and Canada. In 1860, the USA had been an undeveloped economy. In 1890, it was the leading industrial power in the world. — location: [4025]()

---
In 1892, the USA’s continental [[expansion]] was complete. — location: [4031]()

---
dioramas — location: [4126]()

---
The government had always termed the land of [[Australia]] terra nullius, that is belonging to nobody. There — location: [4147]()

---
Japan on the other hand was successful in building a modern nation-state, creating an industrial economy and even establishing a colonial empire by incorporating Taiwan (1895) and Korea ([[1910]]). It defeated China, the land that had been the source of its [[culture]] and ideals, in 1894, and [[mod his 26|Russia]], a European power, in 1905. — location: [4167]()

---
The Qing dynasty, heir to a long tradition, seemed secure in its power, while Japan, a small island country, seemed to be locked in isolation. — location: [4165]()

---
China and Japan have had a long tradition of historical writings, as history was an important guide for the rulers. The past provided the standards by which they would be judged and the rulers established official departments to maintain records and write dynastic histories. — location: [4180]()

---
There was great respect for the written word and literary ability was highly valued. — location: [4184]()

---
These geographical conditions have influenced architecture. — location: [4217]()

---
In the late sixteenth century, three changes laid the pattern for [[future]] development. One, the peasantry was disarmed and only the samurai could carry swords. This ensured peace and order, ending the frequent wars of the previous century. Two, the daimyo were ordered to live in the capitals of their domains, each with a large degree of autonomy. Third, land surveys identified owners and taxpayers and graded land productivity to ensure a stable revenue base. — location: [4227]()

---
Japan lacks a tradition of animal rearing. Rice is the staple crop and fish the major source of protein. — location: [4219]()

---
A person’s merit began to be more valued than his status. — location: [4233]()

---
Other developments such as the increased use of money and the creation of a stock market in [[rice]] show that the economy was developing in new ways. — location: [4240]()

---
The government launched a policy with the slogan ‘fukoku kyohei’ (rich country, strong army). They realised that they needed to develop their economy and build a strong army, otherwise they would face the prospect of being subjugated like India. To do this they needed to create a sense of nationhood among the people, and to transform subjects into citizens. — location: [4275]()

---
The Emperor would be treated with reverence as he was considered a direct descendant of the Sun Goddess but he was also shown as the [[leader]] of westernisation. His birthday became a national holiday, he wore Western-style [[military]] uniforms, and edicts were issued in his name to set up modern institutions. The Imperial Rescript on [[Education]] of 1890 urged people to pursue learning, advance public good and promote common interests. — location: [4280]()

---
The Meiji constitution was based on a restricted franchise and created a Diet (the Japanese used the German word for parliament because of the influence of German legal ideas) with limited powers. — location: [4330]()

---
An influential symposium on ‘Overcoming Modernity’ in 1943 debated the dilemma facing Japan – of how to combat the West while being modern. — location: [4389]()

---
The 1964 Olympics held in Tokyo marked a symbolic coming of age. In much the same way the network of high-speed Shinkansen or bullet trains, started in 1964, which ran at 200 miles per hour (now it is 300 miles per hour) have come to represent the ability of the Japanese to use advanced technologies to produce better and cheaper goods. — location: [4409]()

---
Britain used force to expand its lucrative [[trade]] in opium leading to the first Opium [[War]] (1839-42). This undermined the ruling Qing [[dynasty]] and strengthened demands for reform and change. — location: [4426]()

---
The [[partition]] of Poland in the eighteenth century was a much-discussed example. So much so that by the late 1890s it came to be used as a verb: ‘to Poland us’ (bolan wo). — location: [4441]()

---
Company’. He criticised Indians for being cruel to their own people and subservient to the British. — [[location]]: [4444]()

---
The Chinese borrowed even Japanese translations of European [[words]] such as justice, rights, and revolution because they used the same ideographic script, a reversal of the traditional relationship. — location: [4451]()

---
Since there were only 27,000 official positions, many lower-level degree holders did not have jobs. The examination acted as a barrier to the [[development]] of science and technology as it demanded only literary skills. In 1905, it was abolished as it was based on skills in classical Chinese learning that had, it was felt, no relevance for the modern world. — location: [4459]()

---
They advocated reforms such as the use of simple language in [[writing]], abolishing the practice of foot-binding and the subordination of [[women]], equality in marriage, and economic [[development]] to end poverty. After the republican revolution the country entered a period of turmoil. The Guomindang (the National People’s Party) and the CCP emerged as major forces striving to unite the country and bring stability. — location: [4472]()

---
hemlines — location: [4480]()

---
They identified the ‘four great needs’ as clothing, food, housing and transportation. — location: [4476]()

---
(xiao shimin), — location: [4483]()

---
The Guomindang despite its attempts to unite the country failed because of its narrow social base and limited political vision. A major plank in Sun Yat-sen’s programme – regulating capital and equalising land – was never carried out because the party ignored the peasantry and the rising social inequalities. It sought to impose military order rather then address the problems faced by the people. — location: [4501]()

---
For instance, the Meiji school system, modelled on European and American practices, introduced new subjects but the curriculum’s main objective was to make loyal citizens. A course on morals that stressed loyalty to the emperor was compulsory. — location: [4598]()
