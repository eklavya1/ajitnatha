Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat similar to U.S. hard white wheat.
Wheat grown in central and western India is typically hard, with high protein and high gluten content.
## climate requirement
o Wheat crop has wide adaptability.
o It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north, beyond even the 60 degree north altitude.
*Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow* and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring.
It can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.
## soil
Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India.
Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation.
Care should be taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained oils.
Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions.
These soils absorb and retain rain water well.
