# lumbering
(1.19 pm)
it's industry of cutting down of wood for various purposes.
it's well developed in [[temperature]] regions but not in tropical regions due to foll reasons: _related_ [[prisoners of geography]] | [[=book guns, germs & steel]]

- difference b/w hardwood (tropical regions) & softwood ( temperate regions.): softwood is light, easy to cut, & transport.
- [[biodiversity]]: due to diversity of species lumbering is less economical due to need for cutting & segregating. whereas *temperate regions have single species that are easy to cut*.
- easy of replacement: it takes a long time for equatorial region to grow again as compared to template regions.
- difficulty in [[extraction]]: dense, thick vegetation hinders extraction of woods while in temperate regions wood is easily slid on snow surface.
- weather conditions: high temperature & rainfall reduce economic activity in tropical regions.
- soil condition: lumbering in tropical region will make soil(already weak due to laterization)  is very fragile.
- [[shifting cultivation]] in tropical regions.
- tropical regions are dominated by developing countries thus less investment in lumbering as well as low demand.

# natural vegetation of india

## evergreen forest:
- characteristics:
	- high [[biodiversity]].
	- layers in [[vegetation]].
	- there are 3 types of [[evergreen]] forest in india:
### wet evergreen
[[precipitation]] more than 250 cm.
### semi-evergreen
- precipitation b/w 250-200 cm.
- regions for wet & semi-evergreen
	- western side of western ghats, meghalaya, assam, rest of northeast except northern [[arunanchal pradesh]], some parts of west bengal & orissa, andaman, & nicobar islands.
- semi-evergreen are mostly found surrounding wet evergreen forest.
- important trees of wet & semi-evergreen forests
	- mahogany (one of tallest trees), ebony, rosewood, laurel (water stored in bark), jamun, irul, rubber.
### dry evergreen
- characteristics: they are not very tall but remain evergreen throughout.
- they receive precipitation during winter.
- trees: tamarind, neem, jamun, toddy palm.
- regions: tamil nadu & near coromandel cost
## deciduous forest
- characteristics
- they shed their leaves during winter seasons
- precipitation:100-200 (moist deciduous) & 75-100 (dry deciduous).
- moist deciduous is multilayered & thick forest, whereas dry deciduous is not a multilayered & very thick forest.
- diversity of deciduous forests is less than evergreen forests.
- regions:
	- regions for moist deciduous
		- wetter part of madhya pradesh, maharastra, karnataka, orissa, jharkhand, chattisgarh.
	- regions for dry deciduous
		- it's a wide strip running north-south from himalayas to kanyakumari except regions of tropical thorn & moist deciduous.
- trees:
	- trees of moist deciduous: teak, badam, sal, shishum, jamun, & sandalwood.
	- trees of dry deciduous: bamboo, sandalwood, red senders (most demanded in black market)
## tropical thorn forest
- [[precipitation]] is less than 70 cm.
- they are also c/a [[xerophyte]]s.
- they adapt in various ways:
	- they have short height, bushes, waxy leaves, more thorn & absence of leaves, green stem & some of trees can store water in their trunk.
- regions
	- rajasthan, western madhya pradesh, gujarat, southern part of haryana, & rain shadow region of deccan.
- trees: khair, babool, date-palm, axlewood, acacia, & neem.
## montane forest
- found at a high elevation.
- up to 1500 meters: mixed forest(coniferous & deciduous forest).
- b/w 1500-3000 meters: coniferous forest.
- more than 3000-3500 meters: there will be some grassland & beyond that total snow-covered(alpine vegetation).
- regions:
- entire himalayas, higher elevations of vindya & satpura, parts of western ghats at a higher elevation, nilgiris.
## shola forest
- in high elevation of nilgiris & western ghats.
- grassland along with some vegetations.
- these are very fragile ecosystems.
- trees: oak, deodar, chir-pine, maple, juniper, & rhododendron.
## littoral & swamp forest
- found mainly along coastal regions.
- trees:
	- sundari tree, brugiera, agar, sonneratia.
## mangroves vegetation
(2.50 pm)
- grows in coastal region (brackish water).
- regions
	- all across coastal regions of western coast & eastern coast. but they are more toward western parts.
	- sunderbans, mahanadi delta, bhitarkanika, krishna-godavari delta, coringa,  krishna estuary, dear student, pichavaram, & muthupet in tamil nadu, vembanad, coondapur, goa, ratnagiri, & gulf of kachchh.
- adaptions of mangroves
	- stilt root (survive above water).
	- impermeable roots.
	- pneumatophores (aerial roots).
	- they control opening of stomata.
	- buyout seeds.
### significance of mangroves
- it can survive in brackish water.
- it provides a habitat for coastal ecosystem.
- it prevents erosion due to waves.
- it also reduces impact of cyclones & tsunamis.
- performs nutrient recycling.
- it's a source of timber & tourism.
- issues associated with mangroves:
	- depletion due to over-exploitation & coastal encroachments.
	- changes in rivers flow by construction of dams etc.
	- climate change & sea-level rise etc.
### ******************************
# state of forest report
(3.37 pm)
- released by fsi under ministry of environment, forest, & climate change.
- it's a biennial survey.
- released since [[1987]].
- forest cover: 
	- all lands more than 1 hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10%.
	- it's irrespective of ownership (private or public land).
- recorded forest area: recorded as 'forests' in govt records.
- tree cover: outside recorded forest areas exclusive of forest cover & less than minimum mappable area of 1 hectare.
## forest cover classification in terms of canopy density
- very dense forest: all lands with tree canopy density of 70% & above.
- moderately dense forest: all lands with tree canopy density of 40% & more but less than 70%.
- open forest: all lands with tree canopy density of 10% & more but less than 40%.
- scrub: degraded forest lands with canopy density less than 10%.
- non-forest: lands not included in any of above classes.

# agriculture
- (4.05 pm)
- world agriculture regions
## tropical
## nomadic herding
- depending entirely on animal for milk, meals, & wool, etc.
- regions:
	- central asian region (horse), west asia (camel), china, & mongolia (yak & lama).
	- also in arid & semi-arid regions: sheep & goats.
## shifting cultivation
- also k/a *slash & burn agriculture*.
- forest is cleared & whatever that is left is burned.
- it's a very primitive form of agriculture.
- when soil loses fertility after 2-3 years, people move to another patch.
- regions: rainforest where tribal people live like amazon, venezuela, mexico, congo basin, south-east asia, sri-lanka & northeast india, & some patches of western ghats.
## intensive subsistence agriculture
- intensive: sow crops very closely & repetitively over a small piece of land.
- subsistence: production is mainly for self-consumption.
- mainly grow rice.
- small & highly fragmented landholding.
- very high population density.
- dominated by manual labor.
- grow multiple crops per year.
- very high agriculture productivity but very low per capita output.
- regions: mainly developing & under-developing countries. south-asia, ganga-brahmaputra delta, coastal regions of indo-china, part of eastern china.
## plantation agriculture
- it's only commercial cultivation in tropical regions.
- performed in large estates
- it requires high capital
- most of them are export-oriented.
- depend on manual labor.
- scientifically managed.
- various plantations:
	- malaysia: rubber.
	- indonesia: sugarcane.
	- south-africa: sugarcane
	- west indies: banana & sugarcane.

	- short bushed, deep root system.
	- crops: citrus fruits, grapes, oranges, olives,
	- know for [[viticulture]] & winemaking.
	- regions: mainly in mediterranian, california, argentina, south africa, & australia.
	- extensive commercial grain farming:
		- it's almost opposite to intensive subsistence agriculture.
		- performed over a large area.

## mixed farming
- it's a mix of agriculture & livestock.

- it requires high expenditure & high returns.
- regions: east of prairies in usa, western europe, northeast argentina, & southeast australia.
## commercial dairy farming
- maintain cows & produce various types of milk products.
- high level of mechanization.
- labor-intensive.
- high investments & returns.
