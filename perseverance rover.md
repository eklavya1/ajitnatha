launched in 2020 aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V.

Why is this mission significant?
o It carried a unique instrument, MOXIE or Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment: which for the first time manufactured molecular oxygen on Mars using carbon dioxide from the carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere (ISRU
means In Situ Resource Utilization: or the use of local resources to meet human needs or requirements of the spacecraft). Hence statement 1 is correct.
o It carried Ingenuity, the first ever helicopter to fly on Mars. Hence statement 2 is correct.
o It is the planned first step to bring back rock samples from Mars for analysis in sophisticated laboratories on Earth: with the goal of looking for biosignatures: or signatures of present or past life.

These are some of the key mission objectives:
o Look for signs of ancient microbial life.
Collect Martian rock and dust samples for later return to Earth.
o Deliver an experimental helicopter.
o Study the climate and geology of Mars.
o Demonstrate technology for future Mars missions.

What is the reason for the near-term interest in Mars?
Mars is located in the very near backyard (about 200 million km away).
It is a planet that humans can aspire to visit or to stay for a longer duration.
Mars had flowing water and an atmosphere in the distant past: and perhaps conditions to support life.
It also has implications for commercial travel.
