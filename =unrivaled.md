The United [[state]] could easily squander its geopolitical potential. It could, for example, gut its demographic advantage by restricting _high-skill immigration_. It could allow [[demagogue]]s and special interests to capture its political institutions and run the country into the ground. Or it could fritter away its resources on reckless adventures abroad. In addition, there are any [[number]] of [[events]] (e.g., a nuclear accident, natural disaster, or [[disease]] outbreak) that could disproportionately devastate the United [[state]]. — location: [117]()

The main conclusion is that the United States is several times wealthier than China, and the absolute gap is growing by trillions of dollars each year. — location: [159]()

China’s economy is big butineffi cient. It produces high output at high costs. Chinese businesses suffer from chronically high [[production]] costs, and China’s 1.4 billion people generate massive welfare [[security|and secu]]rity burdens. The United States, by contrast, is big and effi cient, producing high output at relatively low costs. `American workers and businesses are seven times more productive than China’s on average, and with four times fewer people than China`, the United States has much lower welfare and [[security|[[securi]]ty]] costs. — location: [160]()

I show that sustained economic growth depends on three broad factors: geography, institutions, and demography. The ideal geography for growth is one with abundant natural resources, transport infrastructure, and buffers from enemies. 28 The ideal government is one that is capable yet accountable, meaning that it is strong enough to provide services and maintain order, but suffi ciently divided to prevent corruption and the violation of private property rights. 29 Finally, the ideal population is large, young, and educated. — location: [201]()

To rank among the most powerful nations in the world, a state needs to amass a large stock of resources, and to do that a state must be populous and prosperous. It must produce high output at low costs. It must not only mobilize vast inputs, but also produce signifi cant output per unit of input . In short, a nation’s power stems, not from its gross resources, but from its net resources—the stock of resources left over after subtracting costs. — location: [296]()

The logic of combining these factors is that power ultimately depends on the ability to win major wars, and doing that requires a big army backed by substantial industrial might. — location: [402]()

---
What were these costs? First, China was far less productive than [[Britain]]. The average unskilled worker[[london| in Lo]]ndon generated three to six times the output of the average laborer in Beijing, and each [[British]] industrial worker generated sixteen to thirty-three times the output of each Chinese industrial worker. 40 [[British]] workers were not only healthier and better educated than Chinese workers on average, they also had superior [[technology]]. British looms, for example, could produce twenty times the output of a Chinese hand worker, and British power-driven “mules” (spinning machines) had two hundred times the capacity of Chinese spinning wheels. — location: [522]()

The overall picture of the U.S. economy, then, is one of declining dynamism. Some economists dismiss these negative trends as a temporary hangover from the Great Recession or a statistical fluke (standard industrial-era indicators may not capture the economic benefits of new technologies like digital search engines, G.P.S.-generated directions, video chat, etc.). 94 A more worrying possibility, however, is that U.S. innovation is simply not what it used to be. The [[internet]] and smartphones are great inventions, but they may not be as revolutionary as the innovations that propelled previous eras of U.S. productivity, such as the internal-combustion engine, elec-trifi cation, indoor plumbing, and commercial jetliners. — location: [1108]()

According to MIT military expert Barry Posen, the foundation of U.S. hegemony is the U.S. “command of the global commons.” By “commons,” Posen is referring to international waters, outer space, and airspace above 15,000 feet. The United States “commands” these areas in the sense that the U.S. military enjoys almost total freedom of action there and can deny such freedom to other nations. Command of the commons allows the United States to project military power worldwide and coerce adversaries by threatening to cut them off from international shipping routes and communications networks. Global balancing involves challenging U.S. command of the commons. To achieve this goal, Posen explains, a country would need to develop a large suite of power-projection platforms, including aircraft carriers; nuclear-powered attack submarines; guided-missile destroyers and cruisers; overseas military bases; fi ghter, heavy-lift, and airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) [[aircraft]]; and satellites and anti-satellite weapons. — location: [2222]()

Furthermore, when the United States imposes sanctions, it often gets its wealthy allies to help out. In some cases, therefore, the United States has been able to cut hostile regimes off from hard currency, fi nancial credit, vital imports, and access to assets in North America, Western Europe, Ocea-nia, and parts of East Asia. 51 For example, after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the United States, the EU, Japan, [[switzerland]], Australia, and Canada froze Russian assets on their territory, prohibited their banks from conducting transactions with Russian entities, banned top Russian leaders and businesspeople from traveling to their countries, and cut Russia off from advanced [[technology]] imports. The multinational sanctions imposed on Iran from 2006 to 2016 were even more onerous, amounting to an almost total economic embargo on the country. — location: [2369]()

These actions build on a long American legacy of meddling in other countries’ internal affairs. 87 During the Cold War, the United States launched at least seventy-two political operations to coopt or destabilize foreign regimes, sixty-six of which were carried out covertly. — location: [2468]()

---
The fate of unipolarity thus depends on the other major driver of international change: economic convergence. — location: [2483]()

---
The question is: Why do some countries, at some times, grow faster than others? To answer this question, international relations scholars have borrowed an old idea from economics—convergence theory—that holds that poor countries tend to grow faster than rich countries. 94 The reason, according to the theory, is that poor countries enjoy the “advantages of backwardness”: they can copy or steal the latest technologies from [[rich]] countries without paying the costs to invent them; and they can engage in “cost innovation,” mass-producing advanced technologies at a fraction of the price of rich countries, because they have lower labor and input costs. 95 Given these advantages, poor countries eventually move “from imitation to innovation” — location: [2486]()

History helps explain why the U.S. government is smaller and more divided than that of other developed countries. In Western Europe and Japan, law and a modern state came fi rst, followed later by democracy. 195 The United States, by contrast, was born a democracy and only began developing a modern bureaucracy in the 1880s. 196 For most of U.S. history, a vast western frontier, the relative absence of foreign threats, and a liberal ideology limited state building. — location: [2732]()

As a result, Americans are 50 to 300 percent more likely than Europeans and Japanese to start new businesses; 203 and U.S. venture [[capital]] investment as a share of GDP is seven and a half to twelve times greater than that of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan. 204 Americans hire and fi re each other more frequently than do Europeans and Japanese, work 5 to 30 percent longer, produce 10 to 50 percent more output per hour, and earn 50 to 65 percent higher wages. — location: [2745]()

India, too, lacks state capacity. Only 3 percent of India’s population pays taxes (most people are too poor), so India’s tax base is comparable to that of a small European country. India’s government revenues are equal only to 20 percent of its GDP, whereas tax revenues in the other great powers are equal to 30 to 50 percent of GDP, 220 and India’s urban per capita public spending is only $50, which is only 14 percent of China’s $362 and 3 percent of the United Kingdom’s $1,772. — location: [2777]()

the United States is uniquely empowered to impose painful sanctions and embargoes on hostile countries (and to deny enemies the ability to respond in kind) because of its central role in global banking, plentiful energy resources, and unparalleled ability to disrupt international shipping. 36 In the initial stages of a confl ict, therefore, the United [[state]] could use fi nancial sanctions, embargoes, or [[cyber]] operations to try to achieve “victory without violence,” as it did in compelling Iran to negotiate curbs on its nuclear program and in deterring [[mod his 26|Russia]] from annexing eastern [[Ukraine]]. — location: [3050]()
