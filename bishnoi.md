- Bishnoi (also known as Vishnoi) is a Hindu community found in the Western [[Thar Desert]] and northern states of India. They follow a set of 29 principles/commandments given by Guru Jambheshwar (also known as Guru Jambhoji, Guru Jambha Ji) (1451-1536). They are a sub-sect of the Vaishnav Sampraday. As of 2019, there are an estimated 600,000 followers of Bishnoi Panth residing in north and central India. Shree Guru Jambheshwar founded the sect at Samrathal Dhora in 1485 and his teachings, comprising 120 shabads, are known as Shabadwani. He preached for the next 51 years, travelling across India. The preaching of Guru Jambhoji inspires his followers as well as the environmental protectors. Bishnoi sect admitted members from a variety of castes including Jats, Bania, Charans, Rajputs, Brahmins, and Ahirs.
