- **mykolaiv** (Ukrainian: Миколаїв, pronounced [mɪkoˈlɑjiu̯] (listen)), also known as Nikolaev  (Russian: Николаев, pronounced [nʲɪkɐˈla(j)ɪf]), is a city and municipality in southern [[Ukraine]], the administrative center of the Mykolaiv Oblast. Mykolaiv is one of the main shipbuilding centers of the Black Sea. Aside from three shipyards within the city, there are a number of research centers specializing in shipbuilding such as the State Research and Design Shipbuilding Center, Zoria-Mashproekt and others. The city has a population of 476,101 (2021 est.).The city is an important transportation hub of Ukraine (sea port, commercial port, river port, highway and railway junction, airport).
- Mykolaiv's orderly layout reflects the fact that its development has been well planned from the founding of the city. Its main streets, including the three main east–west Avenues, are very wide and tree-lined. Much of Mykolaiv's land area consists of parks. Park Peremohy (Victory) is a large park on the peninsula just north of the city center of Mykolaiv, on the north side of the Inhul river.
