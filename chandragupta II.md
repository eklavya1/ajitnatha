Chandragupta 11 'Vikramaditya': (380-414 AD)
[[Samudragupta]] was succeeded by his son Chandragupta 11 Vikramaditya.
Chandragupta 11 inherited the military genius of his father and extended the Gupta Empire by his conquests.
Mehrauli Iron Pillar inscription says that the king defeated the confederacy of Vangas and Vahilkas.
Fahien visited India during his reign.
He patronized Navaratna poets and scholars, one among them is Kalidasa.
He earned the title Sakari meaning 'Destroyer of Sakas• by ending westem Saka rule. Hence, Statement 3 is not correct.
• As a result of dethroning Sakas, the western boundary of the Empire reached the Arabian Sea gaining access to Broach, Sopara, Cambay, and other seaports.
This enabled the Gupta empire to control trade with the western countries.
The westem traders poured Roman gold into India in return for Indian products.
The great wealth of the Gupta Empire manifest in the variety of gold coins issued by Chandragupta 11.
