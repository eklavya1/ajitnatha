It is a chemical compound with the formula C14H9C15.
Under standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP), this chemical compound exists as a colorless and tasteless crystalline solid.
It is very poorly soluble in water- For all practical purposes, this compound is insoluble in water.
It was widely used in the agricultural industry as an insecticide.
The use of DDT to control diseases like typhus and malaria was not uncommon in the early 1940s.
It is known to act as an endocrine disruptor. Therefore, exposure to this compound can result in interference with the endocrine system.
It is also believed to interfere with the regular thyroid function in pregnant women.
It is classified as a persistent organic pollutant (Non-biodegradable Pollutants).
This compound can penetrate soils and remain there for up to 30 years.
It has a greater rate of bioaccumulation in water and thus poses a great long term-threat to aquatic life.

Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, commonly known as DDT, is a colorless, tasteless, and almost odorless crystalline chemical compound, an organochloride. Originally developed as an insecticide, it became infamous for its environmental impacts.  DDT was first synthesized in 1874 by the Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler. DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Müller in 1939. DDT was used in the second half of World War II to limit the spread of the insect-borne diseases malaria and typhus among civilians and troops. Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1948 "for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods".By October 1945, DDT was available for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning. Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. It talked about environmental impacts that correlated with the widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environmental and health effects. The book cited claims that DDT and other pesticides caused cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Although Carson never directly called for an outright ban on the use of DDT, its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States.A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants which has been in effect since 2004. DDT still has limited use in disease vector control because of its effectiveness in killing mosquitos and thus reducing malarial infections, but that use is controversial due to environmental and health concerns.Along with the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the United States ban on DDT is a major factor in the comeback of the bald eagle (the national bird of the United States) and the peregrine falcon from near-extinction in the contiguous United States.
