# rocks
- 時 - `01:59 am 31/8/2021`
- summation of minerals
- rock is any naturally occurring agglomeration of mineral particles

| rocks                          | minerals                                           |

# igneous rocks
- 時 - `02:04 am 31/8/2021`
- aka `primary rocks`
- formed - cooling, solidification & crystallization of [[magma]]
- no possibility of [[fossil]]
## types
1. [[intrusive igneous rocks]]
2. [[extrusive igneous rocks]]

- can also be classified as acidic or `felcic` #doubt  basic ?
- if silica content > 66%	-	acidic
- if silica content < 52%	-	felcic
- if silica content ~ 60%	-	intermediate rock
# sedimentary rocks
- 時 - `02:12 am 31/8/2021`
- secondary rocks
- formed - solidification of sediments of original [[igneous 石]] or [[metamorphic rock]]
- 1 sedimentary rock can also lead to formation of another
## stages in formation
 #pneumonic _wtdlc_
1. weathering - in-situ breakdown of original rock
2. transportation - of [[sediment]]s
3. deposition - in basin
4. lithification - involves conversion of loose sediments into hard rocks
	 - compaction - sediments are squeezed by weight of overlying layers 
5. cementation - binding together of compacted sediments by natural cementing materials
				- sedimentary rocks are formed by diff `layers/strata`
- contains large quant of [[fossil]]
- exs - sandstone, limestone, clay, chalk, coal, gypsum
# metamorphic rocks
- 時 - `02:19 am 31/8/2021`
- [[老师 ojha 历史 课 tk]]
- changes in formation of rocks via physical or chemical processes
	- _dynamic_ metamorphism - change in [[pressure]] condition
	- _thermal_ metamorphism - change in [[temperature]] condition
# foliation
- 時 - `02:21 am 31/8/2021`
- during metamorphism minerals might get arranged in a series of bands in plane
# lineation
- 02:21 am 31/8/2021
- when minerals are arranged in a linear pattern

# rock cycle
# earth's movements
- geomorphic processes
- endogenic movements
- exogenic movements

| originates from inside earth                        | outside                         |
| source - primordial heat of earth + radioactivity       | solar + gravity                 |
| agents - magma, mantle plumes, movement of lithosphere  | wind, rainwater, landslides     |

| results in - upliftment, subsidence, folding, faulting  | weathering, erosion, deposition |
| forms major units - plateaus, mountains, oceanic basins | valleys, caves, sandunes        |
