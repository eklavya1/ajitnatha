footloose industry is a general term for an industry that can be placed & located at any location without effect from factors of [[production]] such as resources, [[land]], labour, & capital.
These industries often have spatially fixed costs, which means that [[cost]]s of products do not change despite where product is assembled.
Diamonds, computer chips, & mobile manufacturing are some examples of footloose industries.
They are generally non-polluting industries.
Non-footloose industries generally require raw material availability within a time limit to make products.
sugar industry, jute industry, & tea industry are examples of non-footloose industries.
Footloose industries can also refer to processing of products that are neither weight-gaining, nor weight-losing, & face significant transportation costs.
An example of footloose processing industry is [[honey]].
weight of raw honey & wax is same as finishing product. So, whether honey is processed near source of raw materials or at location of final product demand, transportation costs are same.
They are not dependent on any specific raw material, weight losing, or otherwise.
They produce in small quantities & also employ a small labour force.
important factor in their location is accessibility by road network.
