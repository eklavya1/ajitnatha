in this method, a countrys national income can be calculated by adding output of all firms in economy to determine nation's output.
product method is also known as output method or value-added method.
in this method, we calculate national income in terms of final goods & services produced in an economy during a particular period of time.
final goods are those which are either available to consumers for consumption or become a part of national wealth in form of investment.
product method is that which estimates national income by measuring contribution of final output & services by each producing enterprise in domestic territory of a country during a given accounting period.
goods & services used by firms as inputs are known as intermediate consumption.
according to final output method, value of intermediate goods is deducted from value of output.
	value of final output= value of output- value of intermediate goods
when we add market value of final output in primary sector, secondary sector, & tertiary sector, we arrive at gross domestic product at market price.
gdp at market price = market value of final output of primary sector + market value of final output of a tertiary sector
by deducting depreciation from gdp at market price we can get net domestic product at market price. when we add net factor income from abroad, we get gnp & nnp at market price.
