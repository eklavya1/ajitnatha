An overview of previous class was given (1.07 PM)

## Different price points to estimate value
(1.17 PM)
- Prices in time - we may take current market price or we may take some price in past.
- Current market price (nominal [[GDP]]) is most easily available price in economy whereas prices of past help in comparison.
- When [[GDP]] of present year is calculated using some past year’s price, we refer to it as GDP at constant prices.
- There is a special year in past called base year which is used for comparing output of subsequent years.

## Base year & its determination
(1.20 PM) [[base year]]
- base year helps to compare actual output in different years by keeping prices constant to what they were in base year.
- choice of base year becomes an important decision as GDP of subsequent years will be estimated using base year’s prices as well.
- It should have following properties:
	- It should be as recent as possible - a base year in distant past will have a very different structure of economy as compared to present.
	- choice should be such that goods produced in present year & base year are not substantially different.
	- base year should be relatively a stable year with respect to output as well as prices.
	- If base year is such that it has some big disruption in production or administration or prices, then, output of that year would be volatile & thus prices would be unstable.
- Therefore, an effort is made to choose those years in which there was relative [[stability]].
- base year is _used primarily for comparison purposes_.
- Estimation of GDP is undertaken using many different prices, most commonly these are current market price, last year’s price, & base year’s price.
- GDP estimated at current year’s price is most commonly reported GDP number.
- GDP measured using past year’s price conveys to us growth in [[output]] taken place since last year. This is sometimes referred to as real GDP.
- GDP measured at base year price is used to see trend of growth over a longer time period.
- term real GDP is used when we use last year’s prices.

- [[Nominal GDP]] - GDP measured at current year’s prices

## Prices in production chain
- Market price - is price that consumer actually pays. It comprises taxes levied & subsidies given by [[government]].
- As a result, price that a consumer pays is different from [[factor cost]] of that good.
- We can remove effect of taxes & subsidies from market price & arrive at factor cost.
- GDP can then be calculated at factor cost as well.
- Factor cost gives a better idea about how much factor payments would have been done by firm i.e. how much [[income]]s would have been earned.
- [[Market]] price = factor cost + indirect taxes - subsidies
	- That is taxes increase prices paid by consumer & subsidies reduce them.
	- To arrive at factor cost, we remove effects of taxes & subsidies.
- Factor cost = Market price - indirect taxes + subsidies [use your common sense] --> [[equation]]
	- GDP at Factor cost = GDP at Market Price - indirect taxes + subsidies

## Taxes are classified into 2 types
- (2.10 PM)
- government levies taxes on certain events. Eg - [[income]], change of boundary, etc.
- [[Direct tax]]: It pertains to personal income or [[profit]]s. person concerned will be responsible.
- Indirect taxes: Events are pertaining to goods & services.

## concept of basic price
- (2.28 PM)
- Factor costs estimation is done for purpose of finding true price which can be attributed to factors of [[production]].
- However, even when we reduce effect of indirect taxes & subsidies given on product, this may not convey true factor cost as subsidies & taxes may have been given production process as well.
- basic price is defined as price of good at factory gate i.e. price at which good would be sold in market if government does not levy any taxes or pay any subsidies on good.
	- [[basic price]] = market price - product taxes + product subsidies.

- From basic price, factor cost is estimated by removing effect of taxes & subsidies given during production process.
	- Factor cost= basic price- production taxes+ production subsidies

- Eg - government gives subsidies on sugar & levies tax as well - these are product tax & subsidies.
- Fertilizers are provided to sugarcane farmers at a subsidized rate.
- Taxes may have been levied on sugar industry such as to register land or company.
- These are examples of production taxes & subsidies.

- GVA at factor cost= GVA at basic price- production taxes+ production subsidies
- GVA at basic price= GVA at market price- product taxes+ product subsidies
- GDP= GVA at market price= GVA at basic price+ product taxes= product subsidies

- Standard connotations:
	- GVA is measured at basic price.
	- GDP is measured at market price.

## concept of NDP (Net Domestic Product)
3.15 PM
- [[net domestic product]] [[entropy]]

## Concept of GNP
(3.19 PM)
- [[gross national product]]
- 2 connotations of nationals
- National- within economy
- National- as pertaining to citizens.
- Value of output produced by citizens.
- GNP= value of output produced by Indians in India & rest of world.

Dictation (3.31 PM)

- GNP measures value of output produced by nationals of output produced by country.
- Nationals= citizens.
- Indians produce in India as well as abroad.
- Similarly, foreigners also produce in India along with Indians.
- GDP= value of output produced in India
- Value of output produced in india: by Indians (A) & by foreigners (B)
GNP= Value of output produced by Indians: In India (A) & rest of world (C)
GNP= A+C
GDP= A+B
GNP= GDP- B
GNP= GDP-B+C
= GDP+ (value of output produced by Indians abroad- value of output produced by foreigners in India)
= (Value of output produced by Indians abroad- value of output produced by foreigners in India)= Net factor income from abroad
GNP= GDP+ NFIA
- Whether GNP is greater or lesser than [[GDP]] depends upon whether Indians abroad produce more output then foreigners in India.
- If a country has more domestic presence of foreign firms as compared to its citizens producing in foreign lands then a country’s GDP is expected to be higher than its GNP & vice versa.
- National income is specifically defined as NNP at factor cost.
NI= NNP at factor cost
NI= GNP at factor cost- depreciation.
GNP at market prices- taxes+ subsidies- depreciation
- Disposable income refers to post-tax income that is we subtract personal taxes paid from incomes earned to arrive at disposable income.
- It is that part of income that is available to be spent.
- Personal income (PI) = incomes of households from total national income we subtract incomes earned/ retained by businesses & government.
- PI= National income (NI) - (undistributed profits+ net interest paid by households+ corporate taxes) + transfer payments to households from government & businesses
- Personal Disposable Income= PI- personal taxes
GNP vs. GNI
GNP= refers to value of output produced by nationals whereas GNI refers to incomes earned by nationals when they provide some factor of production.
The usage of word GNP has now largely been replaced by GNI because GNI is calculated using NFIA.
When we calculate GNP using NFIA, it may cause confusion between net values of output produced by Indians with net value of incomes earned by Indians.
As a result, to avoid confusion, almost everywhere GNP has been replaced with GNI.

The topic for next class: National income accounting (to be continued…)
