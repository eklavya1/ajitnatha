Saunders' Murder (Lahore, December [[1928]])
Just when the Hindustan Socialist Republic Association revolutionaries had begun to move away from individual heroic action, the death of Sher-i-Punjab Lala Lajpat Rai due to lathi blows received during a lathi- charge on an anti-Simon Commission procession (October 1928) led them once again to take to the individual assassination.
Bhagat Singh, Azad and Rajguru shot dead Saunders, the police official responsible for the lathi charge in Lahore.
