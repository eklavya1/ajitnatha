“[[War]] is hell,” the saying goes. The more scientifically inclined might put it differently: War is [[entropy]]. Atoms split, buildings tumble, people die, and things fall apart. As wars go, the Second World War was the big one—a giant, planetwide entropic pulse that converted whole cities to rubble and some fifty-five million living humans into corpses. No war has ever killed more or even come close. — location: [3454]()

Yet, ironically, producing destruction on that scale took a lot of [[organization]]. — location: [3458]()

- The novelist Neal Stephenson got it right when he described the U.S. [[military]] in World War II as “first and foremost an unfathomable network of typists and file clerks, secondarily a stupendous mechanism for `moving stuff from one part of the world to another,` and last and least a fighting organization.”
- Operating this vast mechanism drew the United States abruptly into world affairs, giving it [[business]] in places it had formerly cared little about. Yet it also left the United [[state]] less interested in formal empire.

- Together with innovations in chemistry and industrial engineering, the U.S. `mastery of logistics` would diminish the [[value]] of colonies and inaugurate a new pattern of global [[power]], _based less on claiming large swaths of land and more on controlling small points._ — location: [3464]() ^c219fa

At the [[war]]’s end, the United [[state]] possessed the world’s fourth-largest empire, accounted for more than half the world’s manufacturing [[production]], and had atom bombs. Why not conquer the globe? — location: [3666]()

The ability of empires to promulgate standards was a major benefit of colonial conquest. — location: [4906]() #empire (first occurrence of this note 11:21 PM 30/9/2021)

The United States wasn’t just an economic superpower, it was a [[military]] one, too. Its vast armed forces had been agents of standardization during the Second World War, and they continued to be so afterward, during the [[cold war]]. Washington flooded the world with its arms and equipment. In accepting them, foreign militaries had to adopt U.S. standards as well. — [[location]]: [5034]()

The stop sign can be added to the list of empire-killing technologies. Taken together, they have had a formidable effect. Synthetics diminished the great powers’ need for strategic raw materials by offering substitutes. [[Aviation]], [[cryptography]], [[radio]], and [[planetary satellites]], meanwhile, enabled those powers to run secure [[transportation]] and [[communication]] networks without worrying about contiguous territorial access. [[innovation]]s in [[medicine]] and [[engineering]]—such as DDT, antimalarials, plastic-based packaging, and “world-proofed” electronic equipment—further reduced the need for territorial control. They allowed objects and humans to safely travel to hostile terrains, meaning that colonizers didn’t have to soften the ground beforehand. — location: [5092]() _related_ [[innovation]] | [[mba]] ^2c94ba

Fighting and winning that [[war]] had taught [[washington DC]] the [[art]] of projecting power without claiming colonies. New technologies helped it achieve, as a writer in the forties put it, “_domination without annexation_.” — [[location]]: [5109]()

Exactly how many [[alaska]] Natives there were is hard to say. The U.S. census did not count them. This was the flip side to the careful annexations, another way to control who was part of the country and who wasn’t. From the start, the census had declined to count most indigenous people. Thus, for more than a century, a government that had reliable decennial tallies of its toymakers and chimney sweeps, of its cows and its horses, could not say how many Indians lived within its borders. — [[location]]: [1229]()
