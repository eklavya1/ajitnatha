war is the only reality that there is. entire history is either about waging war or preparing for the next one

wars in the modern world between industrial nations are normally caused by existential demogaphio or economic where if a certain it threatens the way of life and survival of a society so war is a safe bet.
here are some exs:
1. the crimean war - russia was expandingy rapidly demogaphicany and economically which was threatening the ottoman empire.
2. the american war - the north was expanding go rapidly demogaphically and economically that it the south didn't do anything the north would abolish slavery peacefully without their consent.
3. world war 1 - germany was expanding faster than trance and britain, which wanted a war to stop germany while russia was expanding faster than germany in turn.
4. world war 2 - both germany and japan would have had their crash if they hadn't started a war.
