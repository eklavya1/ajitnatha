the nayak dynasty emerged in south india after the collapse of the vijayanagar empire.
the nayaks, former military govemors of the vijayanagar emperors, declared their independence in 1565 and established their own kingdoms, ruling from the 
16th through 18th centuries.
nayak rule was noted for its administrative reforms, its artistic and cultural achievements, and the creation of a unique style of temple architecture.
there are many distinguishing features of nayak temple architecture as pioneered by the nayaks of madurai and tanjore.
among the main characteristics are the long corridors; the carved hundred-pillared and thousand-pillared mandapas (outdoor temple halls or porches); and the high, multi-storied gopurams (towers adoming the entrance of a temple), richly decorated with brightly-painted stone and stucco statues of animals, gods, and demons.
the greatest example of the nayak style is the meenakshi amman temple at madurai
